<P>

Oh we do, do we?  I find your assertion more than merely somewhat
suspect.  Here's why:

<P>

Three broad areas of concern <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Java arise: its <b>complexity</b>,
<b><b>propriety</b>, and security</b>.  I will today consider in detail only the first
matter.  But as just one example of the others, though, realize that
despite all possible assurances of its alleged pristine and wondrous
security, there shall remain many, many, <i>many</i> sites that simply but
absolutely shall never ever permit running Java viral code downloaded to
their system from elsewhere in the world.  Just go check on this at any of
our national labs or military installations if you don't believe me on
this one. Period, <i>finis</i>, and <font size=-1>QED</font>.

<P>

Setting aside matters of security and propriety for the nonce, let's
examine the first of Java's three critical issues: complexity.

<P>

While I have admittedly not plumbed Java's most profound depths, and
notwithstanding the fact that Java certainly has some interesting lessons
to teach us, it is to all appearances yet another bondage-and-discipline,
ivory-tower programming language that will be forever out of reach of the
``casual'' programmer.  By casual programmer, I do not mean those cerebral
priests in their secluded cloisters dedicating their entire lives to
writing the next great operating systems, newsreaders, command shells,
distributed network admin tools, number crunching spreadsheets, <font size=-1>WYSIWIG</font>
editors, or flashy new programming languages.  No; instead I'm talking
about that incredibly vast majority of <I>simple users</I> out there who are
only trying to get their jobs done, jobs that require a mere modicum of
practical programming rather than stellar science.

<P>

Java seems a lot like an interpreted, somewhat kinder-and-gentler version
of C++.  Lovely!  It is thus destined to raise fierce passions on both
sides based on that aspect alone.  But being kinder and gentler than C++
doesn't make it kind or gentle <i>per se</i>:  while Purgatory may be less
unpleasant than Hell, it's still not a nice place for a holiday.
Likewise, even though Java may be only a bare one-third of C++'s
complexity, that may not suffice:  one-third of a big number <I>is still a
big number</I>.  Java's saddled with a great deal of B&D complexity
stemming from its C++ ancestry and the perceived need to stress
formalistic language concept ideals over the quotidian concerns of normal
end users.

<P>

Perhaps you might care to explain to a simple user why his objects get
``finalized'' at non-deterministic times rather than when he's done with
the object?  Do you want to explain to that simple user why from function
B, he can't call function C if C has an exception in its signature that B
isn't explicitly dealing with, even though he called B from A, and A
<I>does</I> handle C's exceptions?  I know that I for one most certainly would not
relish such a wretched task.

<P>

Unless it should change dramatically, I cannot see how Java can ever
become the Language of Choice for part-time, non-<font
size=-1>MSCS</font>, casual users who have a wee bit of programming to do
(read:  almost everyone who does any programming anywhere).  I will
concede that some  software engineers and mathemagicians may latch on to
this shiny new Rubik's programming bauble, but I don't find Java
sufficiently ``mundane'' for those outside the esteemed Ivory Tower of
cyberlinguistics.

<P>

Scheme is another great example of an interesting language beyond of reach
of mortal men, despite the fact that Scheme is a fine little language of
subtle power which every CS major should study.  But it's not accessible,
so it loses.  What's to stop Java from  falling into the same black hole?
Lavish wealth squandered on marketing blitzen to get Java stuck on the
front page of the <i><b>New York Times</b></i>' Science and Technology
section or the <i><b>San Jose Mercury News</b></i> every few months?
We've all seen that kind of push before: Pascal, NeWS, OpenLook, even
Novell's ephemeral acquisition of Unix.  <i>Et ubi sunt?</i>

<P>

In summary: I believe that until and unless Java should become
substantially easier for normal people to use, your prediction of tcl's
and Perl's impending javanese eclipse is as unlikely an event as that
familiar but fallacious ``imminent death of the Net'' doomsday cry.  
By extension, tools and programming languages like Python, B<font size=-1>ASIC</font>
(particularly the ubiquitous Visual B<font size=-1>ASIC</font> environment), R<font size=-1>EXX</font>, and even
the lowly Bourne shell and its still less respectable brethren aren't
likely to be on their way out the door even for <font size=-1>WWW</font> applications any
time Real Soon Now<IMG SRC="/deckmaster/gifs/tm.gif" alt="[TM]">.


<P>

So sorry, no pictures at 11.
