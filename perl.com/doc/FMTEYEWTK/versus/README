The java whitepaper critique here is OUT OF DATE.  The java people have
since done a GREAT job at fixing up their statements on perl.  See
    http://java.sun.com/whitePaper/java-whitepaper-10.html#HEADING10-9
for details.

I do still wonder about people (not Sun people) who claim java will replace 
all other languages though.  See the new java note for that.
