python          not a complaint, really, just a comparison

java            pointing out things missing from the paper,
                not knocking the language in general.
                they didn't understand perl. 

tcl-*           these are a bit more confrontational
    discussion  prose
    complaints  dirty laundry list
    
csh*            old standby
