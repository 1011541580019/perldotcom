perlXStut - Tutorial for XSUB's
<p><p><hr>

<A NAME="xstut_description_0">
DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>

This tutorial will educate the reader on the steps involved in creating
a Perl 5 extension.  The reader is assumed to have access to the <EM>perlguts</EM>  manpage
 and
the <EM>perlxs</EM>  manpage
.
<p>This tutorial starts with very simple examples and becomes more complex,
bringing in more features that are available.  Thus, certain statements
towards the beginning may be incomplete.  The reader is encouraged to
read the entire document before lambasting the author about apparent
mistakes.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_example_0">
EXAMPLE 1</A>
</H1>

Our first extension will be very simple.  When we call the routine in the
extension, it will print out a well-known message and terminate.
<p>Run ``h2xs -A -n Test1''.  This creates a directory named Test1, possibly under
ext/ if it exists in the current working directory.  Four files will be
created in the Test1 dir: MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, Test1.pm, Test1.xs.
<p>The MANIFEST file should contain the names of the four files created.
<p>The file Makefile.PL should look something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
        # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
        # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
        WriteMakefile(
            'NAME'      => 'Test1',
            'VERSION'   => '0.1',
            'LIBS'      => [''],   # e.g., '-lm'
            'DEFINE'    => '',     # e.g., '-DHAVE_SOMETHING'
            'INC'       => '',     # e.g., '-I/usr/include/other'
        );

</XMP>
<p>The file Test1.pm should look something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        package Test1;
        
        require Exporter;
        require DynaLoader;
        
        @ISA = qw(Exporter DynaLoader);
        # Items to export into callers namespace by default. Note: do not export
        # names by default without a very good reason. Use EXPORT_OK instead.
        # Do not simply export all your public functions/methods/constants.
        @EXPORT = qw(
        
        );
        bootstrap Test1;
        
        # Preloaded methods go here.
        
        # Autoload methods go after __END__, and are processed by the autosplit program.
        
        1;
        __END__

</XMP>
<p>And the Test1.xs file should look something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        #include "EXTERN.h"
        #include "perl.h"
        #include "XSUB.h"
        
        MODULE = Test1          PACKAGE = Test1

</XMP>
<p>Let's edit the .xs file by adding this to the end of the file:
<p>
<XMP>
        void
        hello()
        
                CODE:
                printf("Hello, world!\n");

</XMP>
<p>Now we'll run ``perl5 Makefile.PL''.  This will create a real Makefile,
which make needs.  It's output looks something like:
<p>
<XMP>
        % perl5 Makefile.PL
        Checking if your kit is complete...
        Looks good
        Writing Makefile for Test1
        %

</XMP>
<p>Now, running make will produce output that looks something like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        % make
        mkdir ./blib
        mkdir ./blib/auto
        mkdir ./blib/auto/Test1
                perl5 xsubpp -typemap typemap Test1.xs >Test1.tc && mv Test1.tc Test1.c
                cc -c Test1.c
        Running Mkbootstrap for Test1 ()
                chmod 644 Test1.bs
                LD_RUN_PATH="" ld -o ./blib/auto/Test1/Test1.sl -b Test1.o
                chmod 755 ./blib/auto/Test1/Test1.sl
                cp Test1.bs ./blib/auto/Test1/Test1.bs
                chmod 644 ./blib/auto/Test1/Test1.bs
                cp Test1.pm ./blib/Test1.pm
                chmod 644 ./blib/Test1.pm

</XMP>
<p>Now we'll create a test script, test1.pl in the Test1 directory.  It should
look like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        #! /usr/local/bin/perl5
        
        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib") }
        
        use Test1;
        
        Test1::hello();

</XMP>
<p>Now we run the script and we should see the following output:
<p>
<XMP>
        % perl5 test1.pl
        Hello, world!
        %

</XMP>
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_example_1">
EXAMPLE 2</A>
</H1>

Now let's create a simple extension that will take a single argument and
return 0 if the argument is even, 1 if the argument is odd.
<p>Run ``h2xs -A -n Test2''.  This will create a Test2 directory with a file
Test2.xs underneath it.  Add the following to the end of the XS file:
<p>
<XMP>
        int
        is_even(input)
                int     input
        
                CODE:
                RETVAL = input % 2;
        
                OUTPUT:
                RETVAL

</XMP>
<p>(Note that the line after the declaration of is_even is indented one tab
stop.  Although there is a tab between ``int'' and ``input'', this can be any
amount of white space.  Also notice that there is no semi-colon following
the ``declaration'' of the variable input)
<p>Now perform the same steps before, generating a Makefile from the
Makefile.PL file, and running make.
<p>Our test file test2.pl will now look like:
<p>
<XMP>
        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib"); }
        
        use Test2;
        
        $a = &Test2::is_even(2);
        $b = &Test2::is_even(3);
        
        print "\$a is $a, \$b is $b\n";

</XMP>
<p>The output should look like:
<p>
<XMP>
        % perl5 test2.pl
        $a is 0, $b is 1
        %

</XMP>
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_what_0">
WHAT HAS GONE ON?</A>
</H1>

The program h2xs is the starting point for creating extensions.  In later
examples, we'll see how we can use h2xs to read header files and generate
templates to connect to C routines.
<p>h2xs creates a number of files in the extension directory.  The file
Makefile.PL is a perl script which will generate a true Makefile to build
the extension.  We'll take a closer look at it later.
<p>The files &lt;extension&gt;.pm and &lt;extension&gt;.xs contain the meat of the extension.
The .xs file holds the C routines that make up the extension.  The .pm file
contains routines that tells Perl how to load your extension.
<p>Generating the invoking the Makefile created a directory blib in the current
working directory.  This directory will contain the shared library that we
will build.  Once we have tested it, we can install it into its final location.
<p>Finally, our test scripts do two important things.  First of all, they place
the directory ``blib'' at the head of the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_inc_0">@INC</A>
 array.  Placing this inside a
BEGIN block assures us that Perl will look in the blib directory hierarchy
before looking in the system directories.  This could be important if you are
upgrading an already-existing extension and do not want to disturb the system
version until you are ready to install it.
<p>Second, the test scripts tell Perl to 
<A HREF="perlfunc.html#perlfunc_use_1">use extension;</A>
.  When Perl sees this,
it searches for a .pm file of the same name in the various directories kept
in the 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_inc_0">@INC</A>
 array.  If it cannot be found, perl will die with an error that
will look something like:
<p>
<XMP>
        Can't locate Test2.pm in @INC at ./test2.pl line 5.
        BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./test2.pl line 5.

</XMP>
<p>The .pm file tells perl that it will need the Exporter and Dynamic Loader
extensions.  It then sets the <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> array, which is used for looking up
methods that might not exist in the current package, and finally tells perl
to bootstrap the module.  Perl will call its dynamic loader routine and load
the shared library.
<p>The <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array in the .pm file tells Perl which of the extension's
routines should be placed into the calling package's namespace.  In our two
examples so far, we have not modified the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array, so our test
scripts must call the routines by their complete name (e.g., Test1::hello).
If we placed the name of the routine in the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array, so that the
.pm file looked like:
<p>
<XMP>
        @EXPORT = qw( hello );

</XMP>
<p>Then the hello routine would also be callable from the ``main'' package.
We could therefore change test1.pl to look like:
<p>
<XMP>
        #! /usr/local/bin/perl5
        
        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib") }
        
        use Test1;
        
        hello();

</XMP>
<p>And we would get the same output, ``Hello, world!''.
<p>Most of the time you do not want to export the names of your extension's
subroutines, because they might accidentally clash with other subroutines
from other extensions or from the calling program itself.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_example_2">
EXAMPLE 3</A>
</H1>

Our third extension will take one argument as its input, round off that
value, and set the argument to the rounded value.
<p>Run ``h2xs -A -n Test3''.  This will create a Test3 directory with a file
Test3.xs underneath it.  Add the following to the end of the XS file:
<p>
<XMP>
        void
        round(arg)
                double  arg
        
                CODE:
                if (arg > 0.0) {
                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
                        arg = ceil(arg - 0.5);
                } else {
                        arg = 0.0;
                }
                OUTPUT:
                arg

</XMP>
<p>Edit the file Makefile.PL so that the corresponding line looks like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        'LIBS'      => ['-lm'],   # e.g., '-lm'

</XMP>
<p>Generate the Makefile and run make.  The test script test3.pl looks like:
<p>
<XMP>
        #! /usr/local/bin/perl5
        
        BEGIN { unshift(@INC, "./blib"); }
        
        use Test3;
        
        foreach $i (-1.4, -0.5, 0.0, 0.4, 0.5) {
                $j = $i;
                &Test3::round($j);
                print "Rounding $i results in $j\n";
        }
        
        print STDERR "Trying to round a constant -- ";
        &Test3::round(2.0);

</XMP>
<p>Notice the output from trying to send a constant in to the routine.  Perl
reports:
<p>
<XMP>
        Modification of a read-only value attempted at ./test3.pl line 15.

</XMP>
<p>Perl won't let you change the value of two to, say, three, unlike a FORTRAN
compiler from long, long ago!
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_what_s_0">
WHAT'S NEW HERE?</A>
</H1>

Two things are new here.  First, we've made some changes to Makefile.PL.
In this case, we've specified an extra library to link in, in this case the
math library, libm.  We'll talk later about how to write XSUBs that can call
every routine in a library.
<p>Second, the value of the function is being passed back not as the function's
return value, but through the same variable that was passed into the function.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_input_0">
INPUT AND OUTPUT PARAMETERS</A>
</H1>

You specify the parameters that will be passed into the XSUB just after you
declare the function return value and name.  The list of parameters looks
very C-like, but the lines must be indented by a tab stop, and each line
may not have an ending semi-colon.
<p>The list of output parameters occurs after the OUTPUT: directive.  The use
of RETVAL tells Perl that you wish to send this value back as the return
value of the XSUB function.  Otherwise, you specify which variables used
in the XSUB function should be placed into the respective Perl variables
passed in.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_the_0">
THE XSUBPP COMPILER</A>
</H1>

The compiler xsubpp takes the XS code in the .xs file and converts it into
C code, placing it in a file whose suffix is .c.  The C code created makes
heavy use of the C functions within Perl.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_the_1">
THE TYPEMAP FILE</A>
</H1>

The xsubpp compiler uses rules to convert from Perl's data types (scalar,
array, etc.) to C's data types (int, char *, etc.).  These rules are stored
in the typemap file (<STRONG>$PERLLIB</STRONG>/ExtUtils/typemap).  This file is split into
three parts.
<p>The first part attempts to map various C data types to a coded flag, which
has some correspondence with the various Perl types.  The second part contains
C code which xsubpp uses for input parameters.  The third part contains C
code which xsubpp uses for output parameters.  We'll talk more about the
C code later.
<p>Let's now take a look at the .c file created for the Test3 extension.
<p>
<XMP>
        /*
         * This file was generated automatically by xsubpp version 1.9 from the 
         * contents of Test3.xs. Don't edit this file, edit Test3.xs instead.
         *
         *      ANY CHANGES MADE HERE WILL BE LOST! 
         *
         */
        #include "EXTERN.h"
        #include "perl.h"
        #include "XSUB.h"
        
        
        XS(XS_Test3_round)
        {
            dXSARGS;
            if (items != 1) {
                croak("Usage: Test3::round(arg)");
            }
            {
                double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0)); /* XXXXX */
                if (arg > 0.0) {
                        arg = floor(arg + 0.5);
                } else if (arg < 0.0) {
                        arg = ceil(arg - 0.5);
                }
        
                sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg); /* XXXXX */
            }
            XSRETURN(1);
        }
        
        XS(boot_Test3)
        {
            dXSARGS;
            char* file = __FILE__;
        
            newXS("Test3::round", XS_Test3_round, file);
            ST(0) = &sv_yes;
            XSRETURN(1);
        }

</XMP>
<p>Notice the two lines marked with ``XXXXX''.  If you check the first section of
the typemap file, you'll see that doubles are of type T_DOUBLE.  In the
INPUT section, an argument that is T_DOUBLE is assigned to the variable
arg by calling the routine SvNV on something, then casting it to double,
then assigned to the variable arg.  Similarly, in the OUTPUT section,
once arg has its final value, it is passed to the sv_setnv function to
be passed back to the calling subroutine.  These two functions are explained
in perlguts; we'll talk more later about what that ``ST(0)'' means in the
section on the argument stack.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_warning_0">
WARNING</A>
</H1>

In general, it's not agood idea to write extensions that modify their input
parameters, as in Example 3.  However, in order to better accomodate calling
pre-existing C routines, which often do modify their input parameters,
this behavior is tolerated.  The next example will show to do this.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="xstut_example_3">
EXAMPLE 4</A>
</H1>

We'll now show how we can call routines in libraries, such as the curses
screen handling package, or a DBM module like GDBM.  Each of these libraries
has a header file from which we will generate an XS template that we'll then
fine-tune.
<p>Rather than attempt to find a library that exists on all systems, we'll
first create our own C library, then create an XSUB to it.
<p>Let's create the files libtest4.h and libtest4.c as follows:
<p>
<XMP>
        /* libtest4.h */
        #define TESTVAL 4
        extern int      test4(int, long, const char*);
        /* libtest4.c */
        
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include "./libtest4.h"
        
        int
        test4(a, b, c)
        int             a;
        long            b;
        const char *    c;
        {
                return (a + b + atof(c) + TESTVAL);
        }

</XMP>
<p>Now let's compile it into a library.  Since we'll be eventually using this
archive to create a shared library, be sure to use the correct flags to
generate position-independent code.  In HP-UX, that's:
<p>
<XMP>
        % cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -c +z libtest4.c
        % ar cr libtest4.a libtest4.o

</XMP>
<p>Now let's move the libtest4.h and libtest.a files into a sub-directory under
/tmp, so we don't interfere with anything.
<p>
<XMP>
        % mkdir /tmp/test4
        % mkdir /tmp/test4/include
        % mkdir /tmp/test4/lib
        % cp libtest4.h /tmp/test4/include
        % cp libtest4.a /tmp/test4/lib

</XMP>
<p>Okay, now that we have a header file and a library, let's begin actually
writing the extension.
<p>Run ``h2xs -n Test4 /tmp/test4/include/libtest4.h'' (notice we are no longer
specifying -A as an argument).  This will create a Test4 directory with a file
Test4.xs underneath it.  If we look at it now, we'll see some interesting
things have been added to the various files.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>
In the .xs file, there's now a #include declaration with the full path to
the libtest4.h header file.
<p>
<LI>
There's now some new C code that's been added to the .xs file.  The purpose
of the <CODE>constant</CODE> routine is to make the values that are #define'd in the
header file available to the Perl script by calling <CODE>&amp;main::TESTVAL</CODE>.
There's also some XS code to allow calls to the <CODE>constant</CODE> routine.
<p>
<LI>
The .pm file has exported the name TESTVAL in the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array.  This
could lead to name clashes.  A good rule of thumb is that if the #define
is only going to be used by the C routines themselves, and not by the user,
they should be removed from the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array.  Alternately, if you don't
mind using the ``fully qualified name'' of a variable, you could remove most
or all of the items in the <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> array.
<p>
</UL>
Let's now add a definition for the routine in our library.  Add the following.code to the end of the .xs file:
<p>
<XMP>
        int
        test4(a,b,c)
        int             a
        long            b
        const char *    c

</XMP>
<p>Now we also need to create a typemap file because the default Perl doesn't
currently support the const char * type.  Create a file called typemap and
place the following in it:
<p>
<XMP>
        const char *    T_PV

</XMP>
<p>Now we must tell our Makefile template where our new library is.  Edit the
Makefile.PL and change the following line:
<p>
<XMP>
        'LIBS'      => ['-ltest4 -L/tmp/test4'],   # e.g., '-lm'

</XMP>
<p>This specifies that we want the library test4 linked into our XSUB, and that
it should also look in the directory /tmp/test4.
<p>Let's also change the following line in the Makefile.PL to this:
<p>
<XMP>
        'INC'       => '-I/tmp/test/include',     # e.g., '-I/usr/include/other'

</XMP>
<p>and also change the #include in test4.xs to be:
<p>
<XMP>
        #include <libtest4.h>

</XMP>
<p>Now we don't have to specify the absolute path of the header file in the
.xs file, relying on the Makefile to tell the compiler where to find the
header files.  This is generally considered a Good Thing.
<p>Okay, let's create the Makefile, and run make.  You can ignore a message that
may look like:
<p>
<XMP>
        Warning (non-fatal): No library found for -ltest4

</XMP>
<p>If you forgot to create the typemap file, you might see output that looks
like this:
<p>

        Error: 'const char *' not in typemap in test4.xs, line 102

</XMP>
<p>This error means that you have used a C datatype that xsubpp doesn't know
how to convert between Perl and C.  You'll have to create a typemap file to 
tell xsubpp how to do the conversions.
