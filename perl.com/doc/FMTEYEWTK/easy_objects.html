<h1>Easy Perl5 Object Intro</h1>
</center>

Some people shy away from highly convenient Perl5 modules
because they sometime deal with objects.  And while the managers
haven't figured it out yet, the programmers realize that 
objects are too often used to make something overly complicated
without providing much realistic increased usefulness.

<P>
On the other hand, some problems very much lend themselves to 
objects.  This scares people.  It shouldn't.
There's a tremendous difference between merely knowing enough OO
programming enough to merely <i>use</i> someone else's modules versus enough
to actually design and implement one yourself.  People are afraid of
the having to be the latter just to get at the former.  This is far
from  the case.

<P>

There isn't much to using an object module.  You merely load in the
library, and then call its documented ``constructors'', things that build
new objects, often called <i>new()</i>. 

<P>

If you haven't used perl5 before, you just need to brush up on 
at most one or two new concepts that you wouldn't have seen before.
Here they are:

<P>
<UL>

<P><LI>The <b>use Module</b> statement will load in a module called <i>Module.pm</i> (at compile time) and import its exported
   names into your namespace.  The statement <b>require Module</b> also loads it, but only at
   run time, and doesn't do any imports.

<P><LI>The <b><tt>-&gt;</tt></b> dereferencing arrow is to call a method on an object.  You might
   think of it as sending a message to that object.  You don't need to
   know what's in an object.  It's just a black box thingamawhatzitz
   that you can call methods on.  That's it.

<P><LI>The following two lines are equivalent.  The second mechanism
   is less syntactically ambiguous, however.
<XMP>
    $obj = new CGI;
    $obj = CGI->new():
</XMP>

<LI>Like any other subroutine call, a method call may return 
   anything it wants, even another object.
<XMP>
   use LWP::UserAgent;
   $ua = new LWP::UserAgent;
   $ua->agent("Mozilla/5.0PlatinumB3");  # hee :-)

   $req = new HTTP::Request GET => 'http://perl.com/perl/';
   $req->header('Accept' => 'text/html');

   # send request
   $result = $ua->request($req);

   # check the outcome
   if ($result->is_success) {
      print $result->content;
   } else {
      print "Error: " . $result->code 
		. " " . $result->message;
   }
</XMP>

</UL>

Bingo. EOStory.  That's all folks.  That's all you need to to know to use
object in Perl.  No great magic.  How hard can it be?  

<P>

Here are some examples of using the perl WWW modules.

<XMP>
   use CGI;
   $req = CGI->new();

   use CGI::Imagemap;
   $map = CGI::Imagemap->new();

   use HTML::Parse;
   $html = parse_htmlfile("test.html");

   use URI::URL;
   $url = URI::URL->new('gisle.gif','http://www.com/%7Euser');

   use HTTP::Request;
   $hreq = HTTP::Request->new('GET', 'http://www.perl.com/');
</XMP>

I am not convinced you to need to be a smalltalk and C++ superguru
to deal with this stuff.  But if you <i>do</i> what to learn more,
