<LI>`Procedure names should reflect what they do; function names should
reflect what they return.' --Rob Pike.<LI>Name objects so that they read well in English.  For example, predicate
functions should usually be named with `is', `does', `can', or `has'.
Thus, <CODE>&is_ready</CODE> is better than <CODE>&ready</CODE> for the same function,<LI>Therefore, <CODE>&canonize</CODE> as a void function (procedure),
<CODE>&canonical_version</CODE> as a value-returning function, and <CODE>&is_canonical</CODE> for
a boolean check.<LI>The <CODE>&abc2xyz</CODE> and <CODE>&abc_to_xyz</CODE> forms are also well established
for conversion functions or hash mappings.<LI>Hashes usually express some <I>property</I> of the keys, and are used with
the English word `of' or the possessive form.  Name hashes for their
values, not their keys.<PRE>
   GOOD:
        %color = ('apple' =&gt; 'red', 'banana' =&gt; 'yellow');
        print $color{'apple'};          # Prints `red'</PRE>
<PRE>
   BAD:
        %fruit = ('apple' =&gt; 'red', 'banana' =&gt; 'yellow');
        print $fruit{'apple'};          # Prints `red'</PRE>
