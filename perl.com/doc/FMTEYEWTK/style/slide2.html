<H1>Perl Style: Program Perl, Not C/BASIC/Java/Pascal/etc</H1>

<UL>
<LI>`Just because you <I>can</I> do something a particular way doesn't mean
you <I>should</I> do it that way.' --<I>Programming Perl</I><LI>If you find yourself writing code that looks like C code, or BASIC, or
Java, or Pascal, you are probably short-changing yourself.  You need to
learn to program idiomatic Perl -- which does not mean obfuscatory Perl.
It means Perl in its own idiom: native Perl.<LI>Fall not into the folly of avoiding certain Perl idioms for fear
that someone who maintains your Perl code won't understand it because
they don't know Perl.  This is ridiculous!  That person shouldn't be
maintaining a language they don't understand.  You don't write your
English so that someone who only speaks French or German can understand
you, or use Latin letters when writing Greek.</UL>
