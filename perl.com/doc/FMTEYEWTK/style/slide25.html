<H1>Perl Style: Using A Hash Instead of $$name</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Using a variable to contain the name of another variable always
suggests that perhaps someone doesn't understand hashes very well.
While you could write this:<PRE>
    $name = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $$name{WIFE} = &quot;wilma&quot;;     # set %fred</PRE>
<PRE>
    $name = &quot;barney&quot;;           # set %barney
    $$name{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;</PRE>
Better to write:<PRE>
    $folks{&quot;fred&quot;}  {WIFE} = &quot;wilma&quot;;
    $folks{&quot;barney&quot;}{WIFE} = &quot;betty&quot;;</PRE>
