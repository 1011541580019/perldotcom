<UL>
<LI>It is a myth that you can just plop in <CODE>and</CODE> and <CODE>or</CODE>
wherever you'd been using the punctuation versions.  They
have difference precedences.  You <B>must</B> learn precedence.
And a few parens seldom hurt.<PRE>
   print FH $data      || die &quot;Can't write to FH: $!&quot;;  # NO
   print FH $data      or die &quot;Can't write to FH: $!&quot;;  # YES</PRE>
<PRE>
   $a = $b or $c;      # bug: this is wrong
   ($a = $b) or $c;    # really means this
   $a = $b || $c;      # better written this way</PRE>
<PRE>
   @info = stat($file) || die;     # oops, scalar sense of stat!
   @info = stat($file) or die;     # better, now @info gets its due</PRE>
<LI>Careful with parens here:<PRE>
   $a % 2 ? $a += 10 : $a += 2</PRE>
Really means this:<PRE>
   (($a % 2) ? ($a += 10) : $a) += 2</PRE>
Rather than this:<PRE>
   ($a % 2) ? ($a += 10) : ($a += 2)</PRE>
