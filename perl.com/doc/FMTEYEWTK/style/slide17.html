<H1>Perl Style: Embrace Hashes</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Until you start thinking in terms of hashes, you're
not thinking in Perl.  They can often replace lengthy
loops or complex algorithms.<LI>Use a hash whenever you want to represent a set, a relation,
a table, a structure, or a record.<LI>The words `in', `unique', `first', and `duplicate' should
all set off Pavlovian screams of `HASH!'  If you find them in
the same sentence as `array', you're probably doing something
wrong.</UL>
