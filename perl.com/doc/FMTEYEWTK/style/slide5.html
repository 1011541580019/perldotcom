<H1>Perl Style: The Art of Commenting Code</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Explain what the code does, don't just perl2englishify.
<LI>Eschew gaudy block banners.
<LI>Use comments in regexes with <CODE>/x</CODE>.
<LI>Comment entire blocks, not single lines.
<LI>`Comments on data are usually much more helpful than on algorithms.'
(Rob Pike)
<LI>`Basically, avoid comments. If your code needs a comment to be
understood, it would be better to rewrite it so it's easier to understand.'
