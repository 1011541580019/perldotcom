<LI>Data structures are more important than code.<LI>Rob Pike says: `Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data
structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost
always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to
programming. (See Brooks p. 102.)'<LI>Capture regularity with data, irregularity with code.  (Kernighan)<LI>If you see similar functionality in two places, unify it.
  That is called a `subroutine'.<LI>Consider making a hash of function pointers to represent
a state table or switch statement.</UL>
