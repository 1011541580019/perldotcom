<UL>
<LI>Document your modules with Pod.  Test your pod with <I>pod2man</I>
and with <I>pod2html</I>.<LI>Use the Carp module's <CODE>carp</CODE>, <CODE>croak</CODE>, and <CODE>confess</CODE>
routines, not <CODE>warn</CODE> and <CODE>die</CODE>.<LI>Well written modules seldom require <CODE>::</CODE>.  Users should
get at module contents using an import or a class method call.<LI>Traditional modules are fine.  Don't jump to full objects just because
it's considered cool.  Do it only when the occasion obviously calls
for it.<LI>Access to objects should only be through object methods.<LI>Object methods should themselves access class data through pointers
on the object.</UL>
