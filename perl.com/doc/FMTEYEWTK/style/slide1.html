<H1>Perl Style: Everyone Has an Opinion</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Style can easily become a religious issue.<LI>What I am about to tell you is mostly my opinion.  It
includes both general philosophy and concrete tips. <LI>Warning: I may not always follow my own tips. :-)<LI>I do not expect all of you to agree with me all the time.
Choose a style and stick with it.  Consistency is critical.<LI>I owe indirectly K&amp;P, K&amp;R, S&amp;W, Rob Pike, and Larry Wall for laying
the foundations, and directly Jon Orwant, Mark-Jason Dominus, and Nat
Torkington for reviewing early versions of these notes.<LI>`Under no circumstances should you program the way I say to because I
say to; program the way you think expresses best what you're trying to
accomplish in the program. And do so consistently and ruthlessly.'
