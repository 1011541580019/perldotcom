<LI>`I eschew embedded capital letters in names; to my prose-oriented
eyes, they are too awkward to read comfortably. They jangle like bad
typography.' (Rob Pike)<LI>`<CODE>IEschewEmbeddedCapitalLettersInNames

TheyJangleLikeBadTypography</CODE>.'
(TheAntiPike)<LI>While short identifiers like <CODE>$gotit</CODE> are probably ok, use underscores to
separate words.  It is generally easier to read <CODE>$var_names_like_this</CODE> than
<CODE>$VarNamesLikeThis</CODE>, especially for non-native speakers of English. It's
also a simple rule that works consistently with VAR_NAMES_LIKE_THIS.<LI>You may find it helpful to use letter case to indicate
the scope or nature of a variable. For example:<PRE>
   $ALL_CAPS_HERE   constants only (beware clashes with perl vars!)
   $Some_Caps_Here  package-wide global/static
   $no_caps_here    function scope my() or local() variables</PRE>
<LI>Function and method names seem to work best as all
lowercase.  E.g., <CODE>$obj</CODE>-&gt;as_string().</UL>
