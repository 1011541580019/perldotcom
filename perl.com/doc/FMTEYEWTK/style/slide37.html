<H1>Perl Style: Learn to Switch with for</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Though Perl has no built-in switch statement, this is
not a hardship but an opportunity.<LI>It's easy to build one.  The word `for' is sometimes
pronounced `switch'.<PRE>
   SWITCH: for ($where) {
               /In Card Names/     &amp;&amp; do { push @flags, '-e'; last; };
               /Anywhere/          &amp;&amp; do { push @flags, '-h'; last; };
               /In Rulings/        &amp;&amp; do {                    last; };
               die &quot;unknown value for form variable where: `$where'&quot;;
           }</PRE>
<LI>Like a series of <CODE>elsif</CODE>s, a switch should <B>always</B> have a default
case, even if the default case `can't happen'.</UL>
