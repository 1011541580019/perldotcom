                                        <h2>Perl 6 Summary for 2004-10-18 through 2004-10-23</h2>

<p>Last week, I received a request to summarize perl6-language before internals.
Frankly, it seems like a reasonable idea. Perl6-internals has always been first
as long as I can remember. So perhaps, it is time to switch it up.  Before I
start off with perl6-language, let me remind all American readers to vote.
Non-American readers should also vote, but it seems unlikely that your day of
voting is tomorrow (as I write this). So without further ado...</p>

<h3>Perl6 Language</h3>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndb">Packrat Parsing</a></h4>

<p>Thomas Sandlass posted a link to an article on Packrat Parsing. It looks
like a promising techinque for small programs, although its memory
requirements may be a bit heavy for large programs. Mr. Sandlass appears to
have been Warnocked, but there are several explanations. First, he posted from
Google; there has been trouble in the past about such things getting through.
Second, he posted to Perl6 Language instead of Perl6 Compiler.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drsq">Assorted Questions</a></h4>

<p>Rich Morin wanted to know two things. One, can he hook into function calls
and just about everything else for his evil purposes? Two, can he get floating
point values which automagically track their rounding errors?  Austin Hastings
pointed out that two would probably best be implemented as an opaque object
whose value is a junction. Luke Palmer demonstrated an evil way to embed
whatever hooks he wanted by adding an extra layer to the grammar. Somehow, I
worry that shooting myself in the foot with this would take most of my body
off...</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drsr">Perl 6 Backwards Compatibility</a></h4>

<pre><code> U. Ruirarchzatrea expressed a desire for perfect backwards
compatibility to Perl 5 and a Ponie too.  Matthew Walton, Brent "Dax"
Royal-Gordon, and Luke Palmer all told him that he could have a Ponie, but it
would not be perfect.</code></pre>

<h3>Perl6 Compiler</h3>

<h4>Perl6 Compiler List Troubles</h4>

<p>In the last summary, I mentioned that Perl6 Compiler has not yet found its
way to Google groups. Leo seems to have had trouble subscribing to it also. Perhaps this bears investigation?  Does anyone know someone who can be
poked/prodded/pleaded with about this? End result: no links for you!</p>

<h4>Status Check?</h4>

<p>Ovid popped in to see if he could find more detailed status info about the
progress of P6C. Patrick Michaud provided a slightly unsatisfying answer of
"not much longer," and Luke Palmer provided a slightly more detailed answer,
which can be summarized as "not much longer."</p>
<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/971" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<h3>Parrot</h3>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndc">Unununium</a></h4>

<p>Dan and Steve Fink told Jacques Mony that a port to Unununium would probably
require substantial changes to <em>Configure</em>.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndd">grsecurity Interfering with the Parrot
JIT/build</a></h4>

<p>Apparently, our current scheme of <code>mem_alloc_executable</code> and
<code>mem_free_executable</code> is not quite enough to make grsecurity happy.
Work is ongoing...</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnde"><em>signal.t</em> Failure</a></h4>

<p>Will Coleda had problems with <em>signal.t</em> failing while his machine
was under load. Leo pointed out that this is known behavior. Jeff Clites was a
little confused and disappointed that his earlier patches to help solve this
problem had not sufficed.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndf">New Naming for
<code>parrot_interp</code></a></h4>

<p>Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon warned everyone that he was committing a gianormous
change that would affect any pending patches.  From the lack of chaos on the
list, I would say that his warning worked.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndg">Parrot Forth</a></h4>

<p>Michel Pelletier and Matt Diephouse discussed some of the finer points of
Forth implementations and optimizations.</p>

<h4>Win32 Update</h4>

<p>Ron Blaschke gave a quick update on his progress with VC7.1 on Win32.  Looks
good. Keep on chugging, Ron.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndh">Downloading Parrot</a></h4>

<p>Jerry Wiltz asked if help in downloading Parrot [he was starting from
scratch (no Perl or C compiler)] on a WinXP box. Fred the LastNamelessOne
provided a plethora of useful links.</p>

<h4>
The Return of Register Stacks
</h4>

<p>Miroslav Silovic posted a summary of a design change that he and Leo were
considering. I asked for more details as to how it was different then something
we had moved away from much earlier. Leo provided quite a nice and thorough
explanation. Thanks. Dan observed that this recurring thread happened nearly
yearly, but that the cycle was not quite 12 months. Dan also observed that the
timing coinciding with his being sick was fortuitous. Leo and Dan went back
and forth for a while discussing the implementation and implications of it. I
believe that the end result is that we will have indirect access to registers;
we will not need to have <code>saveall</code>/<code>restoreall</code> pairs
around function calls; and Dan should eventually get better, but not until this
is fully thrashed out.</p>

<li><a href="http://xrl.us/dndn">http://xrl.us/dndn</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>JIT Rework</h4>

<p>As a side effect of indirect access to registers, the JIT needs to be
rejiggered to account for this. Leo and Jeff Clites went back and forth working
on this with what sounds like good progress being made.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndr">Win32 <code>perlnum</code> Test Fix</a></h4>

<p>Ron Blaschke fixed a test failing because of <code>-0.0</code>. Leo applied
the patch.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnds">x86-64 Problems Fix</a></h4>

<p>Brian Wheeler submitted a patch to fix x86-64. Leo couldn't apply it.  Brian
resubmitted. It got mangled on the way. Brian reresubmitted. Leo applied it.
Thanks for perservering, Brian!</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndt">External Dependencies</a></h4>

<p>Robert Spier suggested several options on how to simplify the problem of
Parrot and external dependencies. Sadly, Warnock applies.</p>

<h4>
mod_parrot
</h4>

<p>Jeff Horwitz is making amazing progress with his cybernetically enhanced
parrot. Oh wait, I mean embedding Parrot into Apache. It all looks really cool,
and he has been able to use his experience to provide valuable critiques to us
all.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://xrl.us/dndu">http://xrl.us/dndu</a></li>

<li><a href="http://xrl.us/dndv">http://xrl.us/dndv</a></li>

</ul>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndw">Python, Parrot, and Scoping</a></h4>

<p>Sam Ruby has "been trying to make sense of Python's scoping in the
context of Parrot." Leo, Dan, and Allen Short all rushed to his aid.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndx"><code>Resizable*Array</code>
Implementation</a></h4>

<p>Bernhard Schmalhofer wondered if the <code>Resizable*Arrays</code> should
use chunked allocation. Dan told him, "No, the motivation behind them is simple
and fast, thus the chunking would be unwanted overhead." He did mention that
they could do something clever (like chunking) if they got big enough.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dndy">Register Spilling</a></h4>

<p>In a flash of good news for Dan, Bill Coffman has started to put his mighty
brain to work on the register spilling code. He, Leo, and Jeff discussed
various aspects of it. I eagerly look forward to the results of getting Parrot
a really cool spilling algorithm (although probably not a eagerly as Dan
and his nasty pathological code ;-)</p>

<h4>
C89 Spec
</h4>

<p>Bill Coffman wondered if he could find the C89 spec so that he could ensure
his changes were compliant. Dan suggested using K&amp;R second edition.  Jeff
Clites pointed out the <code>-std=c89</code> flag for gcc. Michael G Schwern
suggested using C99 spec (which should also contain the C89 spec) as a
"frightening accessory this Halloween." Michael frightens me.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://xrl.us/dndz">http://xrl.us/dndz</a></li>

<li><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd2">http://xrl.us/dnd2</a></li>

</ul>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd3"><em>method_util.c</em></a></h4>

<p>Leo asked what the state of the functions in <em>src/method_util.c</em> is.
He got Warnocked. I would say that means they should get pitched and see what
happens.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd4"><code>.include 'absolute path'</code></a></h4>

<p>Matthias Huerlemann created a patch allowing absolute paths in <code>.include</code>
statements. Leo responed that the implementation was not quite right, but the
format of the patch was good.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd5">ICU + Red Hat == Pain</a></h4>

<p>Joshua Gatcomb had a fairly long conversation with himself fleshing out a
problem with ICU on Red Hat. Leo broke into his monologue to say that it seemed
Red Hat specific.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd6">Strange Segfault Involving String
Concat</a></h4>

<p>Matthias Hoelzl has a fairly hard-to-pin-down segfault. Leo suggested trying
to use <code>parrot -G</code>, <code>--gc-debug</code>, and <code>-t</code> to
track it down. No response yet.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd7">pmccache</a></h4>

<p>Leo suggested a small Perl task of making something akin to ccache for PMCs.
Jeff Clites jumped on it.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/dnd8">Befunge Shall Live Again!!</a></h4>

<p>Stepan Roh fixed somethings with the Befunge interpreter while simultaneously
accusing befunge of being unimportant.  Jerome applied some of those fixes and
admonished Stepan for saying such things.  I remember a time when Befunge
fleshed out many troublesome bugs in Parrot, and I forsee a future when Befunge
will be included in webservers everywhere through the magic of mod_parrot!</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drss">Siva, the multifaceted PMC</a></h4>

<p>St&eacute;phane Payrard asked about some problems he had encountered
creating the magical all-in-one Siva PMC. Leo provided a helpful prod towards
<code>LVALUE_CAST</code>. The other problems may or may not related to the
Mandrake Cooker. Hopefully, someone will tell us.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drst">JITted Functions Calling External
Functions</a></h4>

<p>Leo reported that, thanks to Jeff, one can now call into Parrot functions
from JIT. Yay!</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drsu"><code>make testexec</code></a></h4>

<p>Currently, <code>make testexec</code> will create and run a trivial "hello
world" program for the exec core. Leo would like it to run the full test suite
instead. This is a big thing but would probably win you many friends and even
influence people.</p>

<h4>
Calling Conventions and Indirect Register Access
</h4>

<p>Leo provided several warnings that he was going to make some big changes
that would break any code that did not follow the calling conventions. He went
on to implement and commit a whole lot of stuff. I was impressed, and Dan later
wondered if it was all done or not (as he wants to make some big changes soon).
Apparently, it is for the most part.</p>

</ul>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drs3">Stalk Walking Bug</a></h4>

<p>Nicholas Clark, with Leo's help, found a bug in the stalk walking code.
Apparrently, our mask for valid pointers was a little overzealous.  Nicholas
checked in a quick fix. Steve Fink has a few suggestions.</p>

<h4>Register Allocation</h4>

<p>Bill Coffman is continuing his amazing work with register allocation. He has
been making strong progress, and his new code is fast approaching production-ready. Unfortunately for Dan, it still has a few rough points and a small
memory leak preventing it from being used on Dan's evil code.  Leo has been
helping him along the entire time, and I predict that all of Bill's work will
find its way into Parrot before the next summary.</p>

</ul>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drs7">libjit</a></h4>

<p>Robert Spier pointed out the fairly nifty <a
href="http://xrl.us/drs6">libjit</a>. Unfortunately, according to Leo, the
current jit is far enough along that it would be too much work to switch. I
tend to believe him.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drs8">Looking for a Hardware Donation</a></h4>

<p>H. Merijn Brand reminded Leo that he hadn't been contacted yet about some
"Diana" menthol alcohol. I was confused, but apparently Leo wasn't...</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drs9">PMC/inode analogy</a></h4>

<p>St&eacute;phane Payrard wanted to know if his analogy between pmcs and filesystems
was correct. Leo felt that it was mostly right and attempted to explain the 
value/variable split. Dan corrected Leo and went a little further.  What I have
taken away from this is: "do not think of it in terms of high level language
operators, instead think of it in terms of C. You get pointers and values (and
you can point to a value). Some things do shallow copies (i.e. pointer copies)
others do deep."</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drta"><code>pmc_type</code></a></h4>

<p>Nicholas Clark wanted to know what a <code>pcm_type</code> of 0 means. The
answer: no such type. This led to St&eacute;phane Payrard asking about pmc_type values
for abstract types. They don't get types because they can't be directly
instantiated. This led Paolo Molaro to wonder about the virtue of having a
system closer to C++ with array lookup for virtual functions. Nicholas, Leo,
and Paolo banged on this for awhile and decided that there was some room for
optimization. Leo scares me when he optimizes...</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtb"><em>extend.c</em>:
<code>Parrot_call</code></a></h4>

<p>Leo was bothered by the fact that <code>Parrot_call</code> only supported
void return values.  Much to Jeff Horwitz's joy, he fixed it.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtc">Computed Goto Destroyer of Weak
Machines!!!</a></h4>

<p>Vijay D. though that parrot was failing to install when it "hung" while
compiling the computed goto cores. Nick Glencross, Leo, Dan, Peter Sinnott, and
Joshua Gatcomb all helped out, explaining that cg is really hard on one's system
and can be disabled with the <code>--cgoto=0</code> flag to
<em>Configure.pl</em>.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtd">Byte Code</a></h4>

<p>Peter Hickman wanted to know if Perl 6 would be able to be distributed in
bytecode. The answer is yes, but this won't help you hide your source, as that
will frequently be necessary meta-data. It will, however, speed up your
compilation and even allow mmap of the bytecode to share between threads.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drte">Pirate/Python</a></h4>

<p>Sam Ruby has continued his work on Python and is making good progress.  He
was a little concerned about the speed issues of converting everything to
dynclasses. He and Leo talked out some alternatives. Things are looking
promising.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtf">Threading Issues</a></h4>

<p>Sam Ruby wanted to know about possible threading issues. Leo requested that
they let the sleeping giant lie for a while longer.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtg"><code>.include "../relative
path"</code></a></h4>

<p>Matt Diephouse added a todo item for <code>.include</code>ing with relative
paths.  Takers welcome.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drth">Array Fun</a></h4>

<p>Bernhard Schmalhofer added a few benchmarks for the various array PMCs.
Leo applied the patch.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drti">Prederefed Run Cores</a></h4>

<p>Leo had some concerns about the prederef run cores. Dan suggested pitching
them, but Leo opted to fix them instead. Some discussion of their relative
values ensued, and then someone started using assembly to support a point and my
head exploded.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtj">Parakeet in CVS</a></h4>

<p>Michel Pelletier has finally gotten himself a perl.org account. The idea is
that this would allow him to maintain Parakeet in CVS. Unfortunately, Warnock
applies.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtk">GC Crash</a></h4>

<p>Matt Diephouse found a way to make Parrot's GC crash. Leo fixed it with
alacrity.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtm">PPC JIT failure</a></h4>

<p>Jeff Clites found and fixed a bug in the grow-the-arena threshold for JIT.
Leo seemed to feel that Jeff's solution was only a temporary one.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtn">AIX PPC JIT warning</a></h4>

<p>Jeff Clites voiced some concern over the state of JIT on AIX. Adam Thomason
told him, "Worry not, it's already broken."</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drto">Call Chain Access</a></h4>

<p>Appropriately, Leo found himself playing with chains around Halloween.  He
wondered if the call chain should have a PMC wrapper. Dan figured not, as ops
which do evil things would be unlikely to be invoked accidentally, whereas a
PMC might...</p>

<h4>
newsub opcodes
</h4>

<p>Leo wanted to add some newsub opcodes to save allocations. Dan countered
that it would be a better thing to make constant PMCs work properly.  Leo
did.</p>

</ul>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drts"><em>pmc2c2.pm</em> features</a></h4>

<p>Leo suggested a couple of extra features that he wanted in <em>pmc2c2.pm</em>.
Sam Ruby supplied them.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtt">Build Dynclasses by Default</a></h4>

<p>Will Coleda provided a patch to build dynclasses by default. Leo is stalling
before applying it, hoping to hear from other platforms. Now would be a great
time to chime in... ::cricket noises:::</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtu">Warnings for Duplicate Vars</a></h4>

<p>IMCC currently doesn't produce them. Will Coleda supplied a naive
attempt at this, but Leo decided it would be better to do it the elegant
way and split the PASM and PIR lexers/parsers apart.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtv">Parrot on AMD64</a></h4>

<p>Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon managed to find an AMD64 for himself. Not only am I
jealous, but Parrot passes all expected tests on it when built with
<code>--ccflags=':add{ -fPIC }</code>.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtw">dynopslib Troubles</a></h4>

<p>Klaas-Jan discovered that dynopslib was failing. Leo concurred and asked
for patches.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtx">makefile bad <code>$(TOUCH)</code></a></h4>

<p>Jeff Clites noticed that <em>Makefile</em>'s <code>$(TOUCH)</code> does not
actually work on many platforms and suggested a solution. Michael G. Schwern
suggested using <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ExtUtils-Command">ExtUtils::Command</a>
instead. Who knows what will finally happen?</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drty">Debug ops</a></h4>

<p>Dan wondered about adding some ops for debugging parrot code. The response
was favorable and enthusiastic.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drtz"><code>parrot -t</code> Massive Leaks</a></h4>

<p>Dan noticed that <code>parrot -t</code> leaks more memory then most cheap
computers have.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drt2">hash vtable</a></h4>

<p>Sam Ruby wondered about adding a hash vtable method for Python's benefit.
Dan seemed to think it was a good idea.</p>

<h4><a href="http://xrl.us/drt3">disassembler broken</a></h4>

<p>Matt Diephouse noticed that the dissambler was broken. Dan pointed out that
he was testing it wrong, but Matt soon discovered that it didn't work even if
he tested it right.</p>

<h4>
Shebangs for Everybody
</h4>

<p>James deBoer provided a patch adding shebang lines to <em>config/*.pl</em>.
Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon reasoned that these were unnessecary as these scripts
should only be run by <em>Configure.pl</em>. James countered by offering a
patch removing all of the shebang lines from the other ones. I like his
style.</p>
