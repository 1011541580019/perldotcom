<p>If you've ever had to manage a web site with tens of thousands of pages of
content where many people need to be able to update that content, you've no
doubt recognized the need for a content management system (CMS). Once you start to
manage <em>several</em> such sites, the problem becomes even worse. Since
you're reading this article on Perl.com, I'm going to go out on a limb and
guess that you're actually interested in Perl-based content management
systems.</p>

<p>Well, you're in luck.</p>

<p>This article is the first in a series on Perl.com introducing Bricolage, a
Perl-powered, open-source, enterprise-class CMS currently in production for
some of the most actively updated sites on the Internet today, including <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/" title="Visit MacCentral">MacCentral</a>,
<a href="http://et.yahoo.com/" title="Visit ETonline">ETonline</a>, and the <a href="http://www.who.int/" title="Visit the WHO site">World Health
Organization</a>. I start with a high-level overview (think <em>executive
summary</em>) of the concept of content management, the nature of the content
management ecosystem, and how Bricolage competes with other solutions in that
ecosystem. Future articles will cover installation, document modeling,
templating, and the Bricolage SOAP interface, among other topics. But first,
the basics.</p>

<h3>What is Content Management?</h3>

<p>So much is made of the importance of web content management these days that
the term, unfortunately, has been used to apply to just about any piece of
software that somehow relates to the Web or to HTML. This trend has naturally
eroded the meaning of the term <dfn>content management</dfn>. So I'm just
going to punt on providing yet another definition, and focus instead on
contrasting some of the categories of site-management software. In the
process, I highlight where and how Bricolage fits into the CM ecosystem, and
you get the benefit of determining what category of solution best fits your
own content management needs.</p>

<h4>Content Management vs. Community Building</h4>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/971" template="b/article_sidebar.view">

<p>First, there is the difference between content management systems and what
I call <dfn>community-building</dfn> solutions, such as <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/" title="Visit Slashcode.com">Slash</a> and the
<a href="http://phpnuke.org/" title="PHP-Nuke">various</a> <a href="http://www.postnuke.com/" title="PostNuke">Nuke</a> <a href="http://cpgnuke.com/" title="CPG Nuke">engines</a>. These applications
are ideal for setting up community-building and discussion sites, such as <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/" title="MacRumors.com">MacRumors.com</a>, or
(my favorite) <a href="http://use.perl.org/" title="use Perl">use
Perl</a>. The idea behind these solutions is to allow site users to register
with the site and post comments about articles, content on other sites, or
each other's comments.</p>

<p>True content management systems, on the other hand, are primarily designed
to allow organizations to centrally manage and deliver <dfn>content</dfn>,
such as articles, white papers, marketing materials, or what have you. The
emphasis is not on discussion (and indeed, most content management
systems -- including Bricolage -- don't offer discussion interfaces),
but on assuring the consistency of content structure and formatting. Good
examples of such systems include <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/"
title="Visit the Bricolage site">Bricolage</a>,
<a href="http://www.plone.org/" title="Visit the Plone site">Plone</a>,
<a href="http://www.vignette.com/" title="Vignette">Vignette</a>, and <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/" title="Interwoven">Interwoven TeamSite</a>.</p>

<h4>Application Framework vs. Turnkey Application</h4>

<p>Next, there's the distinction between <dfn>application frameworks</dfn> and
<dfn>turnkey applications</dfn>. Frameworks are not actual solutions, but
provide the tools for you to create your own solutions. Anyone who has
programmed in Java understands what a framework is; a content-management
framework provides an array of tools and libraries that you can use (or pay
high-priced consultants to use on your behalf) to create an application to
meet your needs.</p>

<p>Many organizations have bought such frameworks, and in large,
heterogeneous environments with six- and seven-figure budgets and years to
implement a solution, it can make a lot of sense. Good examples of such
frameworks are Vignette, TeamSite, and the Python-based <a href="http://www.zope.com/" title="Zope Corporation">Zope</a>.</p>

<p>A turnkey application, on the other hand, is a complete application out of
the box. It will still likely require a good deal of customization to
implement a turnkey application-based solution in a complex environment, but
we're typically talking weeks or, at the most, a few months. The downside to
such a solution is that you're limited to the features that the developers of
the application anticipated would be needed; only with open-source solutions
do you have the possibility of adding your own. Fortunately, this category of
content management is well represented in the open-source space, including
such stalwarts as Bricolage, Plone (built on the Zope framework),
and <a href="http://typo3.org/" title="The Typo3 site">TYPO3</a>.</p>

<h4>Application Server vs. Document Management and Publishing</h4>

<p>And finally, there is the difference between content management
<dfn>application servers</dfn> and <dfn>document management and
publishing</dfn> solutions. Application servers serve dual roles in life: they
provide an interface for managing content, and they deliver that content to
the final audience. This approach has advantages for some organizations, in
that it requires only a single server, document updates are immediate, and you
need deal with only one technology. Plone, Zope, and the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb" title="WikiWiki">various</a> <a href="http://www.twiki.org/" title="Twiki">Wiki</a> <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/" title="Kwiki">solutions</a> for ad-hoc content
management are typical content-management application servers. <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/" title="Blosxom">Blogging</a> <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org/" title="Movable Type">software</a> tends to
fall into this category, as well.</p>

<p>The downside to application servers is that, because they both manage and
deliver content, your choice of delivery technology is limited to the
technology choices of the software developers. With Plone, for example, you
have to use Zope to serve content to the final audience. Furthermore, many of
them provide templates for the output of content that limit how much you can
customize the look and feel of your site. And finally, performance on a
high-volume site can suffer, due to the overhead of the API and database, as
well as the trickiness of distributing content across an array of application
servers (think caching).</p>

<p>Document management and publishing systems, however, function entirely
independent of delivery solutions. They focus on managing documents, moving
them through workflow, ensuring the consistency of their structures, and
publishing them to external systems for delivery to the end audience. Content
is completely independent of presentation in these systems. Upon publication,
they push content through templates to format it into one or more types of
output (HTML, XML, RSS, Mason, PHP, etc.), and then distribute the resulting
files to other servers (typically a web, file, or application server) for
delivery to the final audience.</p>

<p>This separation allows the document management
and publishing server to do what it does best, freeing up the delivery server
to do what it does best: serve content. Bricolage is perhaps the best-known solution in this category. Another one is the recently introduced <a href="http://krang.sourceforge.net/" title="The Krang site">Krang</a>, which
is itself heavily based on Bricolage.</p>

<p>The downside to the document management and publishing systems is that,
while you are free to use whatever delivery technology you wish (plain HTML,
PHP, JSP, ASP, TT3, SSI, etc.), for security and scalability reasons the
publishing server generally must run on its own hardware, independent of the
delivery server. Furthermore, these solutions tend to have a broader set of
features than their application-server cousins. Since they don't worry about
serving content, they can provide other essentials such as document modeling,
workflow, multi-site management, multiple output channels, etc. While such
functionality increases the flexibility of the software, it can also increase
the complexity of an implementation. The upshot is that the implementation of
such a solution requires a good deal of forethought and planning.</p>

<h3>Why Bricolage?</h3>

<p>Now that you have a feel for where Bricolage fits into the content-management universe (see how it's grown beyond an &quot;ecosystem&quot; in the
space of a few paragraphs?), let's take a look at why Bricolage is a good
solution for the complex content-management needs of organizations with large
volumes of content, many content contributors and editors, and/or multiple
sites to manage. Essentially, this boils down to a brief overview of some of
the more important features of Bricolage. Once you've read this section, you
should have a good idea of whether Bricolage is right for your
organization.</p>

<h4>Browser-based Editing and Administration</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage provides a complete browser-based interface. Designed to work
      with any standards-compliant graphical browser, you can handle nearly
      all configuration and administration tasks via the browser. All document
      editing can be carried out in the browser, as well. Content authors can
      create and edit content using up to four different interfaces, including
      separate fields for each block-level piece of content (paragraphs,
      headers, blockquotes, etc.), bulk editing of multiple fields at once, or
      WYSIWYG-style editing with <a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/" title="The
      htmlArea site">htmlArea</a> in Internet Explorer and Gecko-based
      browsers such as Mozilla and Firefox.</p>
   

  <h4>Document Modeling</h4>
  
    <p>The document-modeling features of Bricolage allow you to model the
    structure of your documents entirely via the browser-based interface. Once
    you've ascertained the different types of documents your organization
    needs to manage, and what their structures will be, you can model them in
    Bricolage. All documents created in Bricolage are based on such models,
    and as such, must adhere to the hierarchical definition of elements and
    fields that constitute their models. This approach assures the consistency
    of document structure.</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/element_profile_half.gif" width="400" height="609" alt="Bricolage Element Profile" />
      <p><em>Bricolage's element-administration interface makes it easy to create 
        new elements, add sub-elements, and create content fields.</em></p>
    </div>














    <p>Bricolage document models are built into a tree-like structure of
    <dfn>elements</dfn> and <dfn>fields</dfn>. Elements are the building
    blocks of content in Bricolage. They represent various parts of documents,
    such as pages; side bars; related media such as images, lists, related
    links; and the like. Every element can contain zero or more sub-elements,
    and together the hierarchy of elements make up the &quot;branches&quot; of the
    document model tree. Fields represent the &quot;leaves&quot;, and are the
    containers into which content can be entered. Any kind of HTML field can
    be defined for use in the Bricolage UI, including <code>text</code> input
    fields, <code>textarea</code> fields, and <code>select</code>
    lists. Typical fields include &quot;paragraphs,&quot; &quot;headers,&quot; &quot;list
    items,&quot; &quot;teasers,&quot; and &quot;URLs.&quot;</p>

    <p>When an editor creates a document, it is based on a document model, and
    its structure must adhere to the model's element structure. Documents
    consist of a tree structure of elements, corresponding to the element
    structure of the document model, and in this way ensure the consistency of
    structure across documents. For more on Bricolage document modeling and
    elements, watch for the third article in this series, &quot;Bricolage
    Document Modeling.&quot;</p>
  

  <h4>Separation of Content from Presentation</h4>
  
    <p>Since Bricolage document models are purely about structure, and a
    document's content will be stored in Bricolage in the same structured
    fashion as its model defines, no presentation information is generally
    included in a document. In other words, the content of a document is pure
    content, with little or no reference to formatting. Instead, it is a
    simple structural object representing the tree-like configuration of
    content elements.</p>

    <p>The upside to this architecture is that highly structured content
    enables a virtually unlimited array of output options. The templates that
    format content can take advantage of the well-defined composition of a
    document model to grab the elements they need for the format they
    understand. Thus, a single document can be used to output a structured XML
    file, a set of HTML pages, an RSS feed, a PDF file, or whatever you
    require.</p>

<p>Done right, you get the Holy Grail of one canonical document and
    unlimited representations of that document. This capability is especially
    important in the fast-moving environment of the Internet, where new
    formatting standards are regularly introduced, demanding the creation of
    new templates to output existing content to satisfy the new standards.</p>
  

  <h4>Content Categorization</h4>
  
    <p>All Bricolage documents can be organized into one or more categories.
    These categories are hierarchical, and the hierarchies are used in part to
    create document URLs. This design allows you to store your documents in
    sensible locations on your web site, and provides them with legible URLs
    that search engines just love. Furthermore, it's easy to search for
    documents in a given category or set of categories using the Bricolage
    API, so that you can quickly create templates to generate category-specific directories of documents, such as RSS feeds.</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/category_manager_half.gif" width="400" height="305"
           alt="Bricolage Category Manager" />
      <p><em>Bricolage allows you to create an unlimited number of hierarchical 
        categories in which to file documents.</em></p>
    </div>
  

  <h4>Meaningful URLs</h4>
  
    <p>In addition to categories, Bricolage document URLs can include the
    year, month, day of the month, and/or a <dfn>slug</dfn> &#x2014; which is a
    short string describing the document, such as &quot;bricolage-intro.&quot;
    Combined, these pieces of metadata generate meaningful URLs, such
    as <code>/features/perl/2004/17/26/bricolage-intro</code> for a Perl
    feature introducing Bricolage and published on 26 July 2004. Such URLs are
    very search-engine friendly, too, so they should greatly enhance your
    Google rankings, for example.</p>
  

  <h4>Keywords</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage documents can be associated with arbitrary keywords. These,
    too, can be queried via the Bricolage API, making keyword indexes a
    possibility. And of course, they're available in templates for
    outputting <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags, <a href="http://dublincore.org/" title="Dublin Core Metadata
    Intiative">Dublin Core Metadata</a>, and the like.</p>
  

  <h4>Workflow</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage provides a workflow interface for managing your documents and
    templates. A <dfn>workflow</dfn> is a way to organize the process of
    creating a document. Typically, a document workflow defines areas of
    responsibility in the process of creating a document, such as writing,
    copy editing, legal review, and publishing. True to its original genesis
    among newspaper publishers, Bricolage workflows divide these
    responsibilities between <dfn>desks</dfn>. So one might have a workflow
    named &quot;Document&quot; for managing documents, with an &quot;Edit Desk,&quot;
    a &quot;Copy Desk,&quot; a &quot;Legal Desk,&quot; and a &quot;Publish Desk.&quot;</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/desk_story_half.gif" width="400" height="313"
           alt="Bricolage Document Workflow" />
      <p><em>Bricolage workflows can be configured to reflect your organization's 
        standard editorial processes.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>You can create as many workflows as your organization requires, each
    with as many desks as you require. Desks can be shared across
    workflows &#x2014; if you need certain parties to assume similar
    responsibilities in different workflows &#x2014; and you can set up
    permissions such that certain users have access only to the documents in
    specific workflows and on specific desks. In short, you have a lot of
    flexibility to closely model the actual workflow in your organization, so
    that working with Bricolage is simply an extension of your users' standard
    editorial processes.</p>
  

  <h4>Output Channels</h4>
  
    <p>Output channels are collections of templates that output content in
    particular formats. Typical Bricolage solutions in production today have
    output channels for XHTML, RSS, WML, etc. Furthermore, output channels can
    include templates from other output channels. When Bricolage looks for a
    template, it looks in the output channel being published to, and then any
    output channels it includes. The search for the template resembles how
    Perl searches through the <code>@INC</code> array for a module. The upshot
    is that Bricolage makes it easy for you to create libraries of templates
    that can be used across output channels.</p>

    <p>Bricolage templates correspond to document categories and elements, so
    that one element template outputs the content of a single element, or
    wraps the output of document-element templates for all documents in a
    category. Because a single element definition can be associated with
    different document models, this approach ensures the formatting of the
    content in elements based on that definition will be consistent across all
    documents.</p>
  

  <h4>Perl Templating</h4>
  
    <p>The templates in Bricolage output channels can be implemented in one
    of three templating architectures:
    <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/" title="Mason HQ">Mason</a>,
    <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/" title="Template Toolkit
    home">Template Toolkit</a>, or <a href="http://html-template.sourceforge.net/" title="HTML::Template
    home">HTML::Template</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, that's right, not only do you have three
    different choices for templating in Bricolage, but they're all Perl-based!
    In addition to being able to provide a familiar templating environment to
    tens of thousands of Perl programmers worldwide, the templating solutions
    can leverage the full power of Perl to generate output for your
    documents. That power of course includes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/"
    title="Search CPAN">CPAN</a>, where you'll find modules to ease the
    generation of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/"
    title="XML::RSS on CPAN">RSS</a> feeds, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/" title="CGI.pm on
    CPAN">HTML</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Generator/"
    title="XML::Generator on CPAN">XML</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDFLib/" title="PDFLib on
    CPAN">PDFs</a>, or even <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel/"
    title="Spreadsheet::WriteExcel on CPAN">Excel files</a>!</p>
   
    <p>Furthermore, Bricolage has a sub-classable templating architecture,
    which means that, with a little bit of work, you can add your own
    templating architecture. Anyone care to add support for <a href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/" title="Embperl home">Embperl</a>,
    <a href="http://www.apache-asp.org/" title="Apache::ASP
    home">Apache::ASP</a>, or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-LibXSLT/" title="XML::LibXSLT on
    CPAN">XSLT</a>?</p>

  <h4>Multi-site Management</h4>
  
    <p>More and more organizations are finding themselves managing more and
    more sites as part of their content-management responsibilities. As of
    version 1.8.0, Bricolage offers support for managing multiple sites from a
    single instance. Different sites can have their own categories, workflows
    (but share desks), output channels (but can include output channels from
    other sites), and distribution destinations. They can also share document
    models, so that different sites can manage the same types of documents but
    publish them with their own templates. This flexible multi-site management
    allows you to divide responsibilities appropriately while keeping all
    content centrally managed and accessible via a common interface.</p>

      <p><em>You can manage any number of different sites in Bricolage, each with 
        its own documents, categories, templates, and workflows.</em></p>
    </div>
  















  <h4>Document Aliasing</h4>
  
    <p>Once you have several departments in your organization managing their
    own sites, they might decide that they need to publish <em>each
    other's</em> content. Fortunately, if these sites are using the same
    document models, they can. Users with READ access to another site can
    create <dfn>aliases</dfn> to documents on that site. They can edit the
    title, URL, and keywords of the alias for the benefit of their own site,
    but the content remains in read-only form, so that editorial control
    remains in the hands of the originating site. Document aliasing thus
    provides a simple approach for sites to publish each other's content
    without violating one another's editorial integrity.</p>
  

  <h4>SOAP Interface</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage features a robust and full-featured SOAP interface. The included
    <em>bric_soap</em> command-line client makes it easy to import and export
    documents, templates, and administrative objects, as well as bulk publish
    or update content. The ability to import content is especially important
    for organizations that wish to migrate their existing documents into Bricolage for management and publishing going forward. Watch for an
    article later in this series that highlights the flexibility and power of
    the Bricolage SOAP server.</p>
  

  <h4>Scalability</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage is designed to scale to the needs of the largest
    organizations. Its scalability manifests in three directions.
    <em>Horizontal</em> scalability is ensured by the ability to distribute
    the load between separate database, application, preview, and distribution
    servers. And remember, because Bricolage operates independent of the
    delivery of content to the final audience, your site's front-end servers
    can scale independently of Bricolage.</p>

    <p>The browser-based interface provides <em>Geographical</em> scalability
    by allowing users to securely use Bricolage from anywhere in the
    world. Whether content editors are down the hall, across the country, or
    on the other side of the globe, if they have a browser and access to the
    Bricolage server's network, then they can be contributing content to your
    sites.</p>

    <p>And finally, the Bricolage feature-set ensures <em>organizational</em>
    scalability, allowing for the centralized management of multiple sites,
    multiple types of documents, content categorization, and flexible
    templating across an organization and its sites. These features can be
    exercised as necessary as the needs of your organization evolve. In other
    words, Bricolage rapidly adapts to the changing requirements of your
    content-management environment.</p>
  

  <h4>Security</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage provides comprehensive security via encryption, user
    permissions, and its independence from your delivery servers. All
    communications with Bricolage can be encrypted over SSH/TLS to ensure
    secure use of the server from anywhere in the world. The same applies to
    the SOAP server, of course. At the access level, Bricolage provides a
    comprehensive permissions system to ensure that users get access only to
    the content and administrative objects relevant to getting their work
    done. And because Bricolage does not serve content to your final
    audience &#x2014; it generally runs as a back-office application and often
    behind a secure firewall &#x2014; your content library remains safe in
    Bricolage even if the security of your front-end servers becomes
    compromised.</p>

      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/user_group_permissions_half.gif" width="400" height="846"
           alt="Bricolage Permissions Administration" />
      <p><em>Bricolage offers a comprehensive permissions system to ensure users get access to only the objects they need to get their jobs done.</em></p>
    </div>
  

  <h4>ROI</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage's open-source licensing helps to ensure that it is fully
    buzzword compliant, in that you can achieve a much higher return on
    investment (ROI) than with competitive commercial systems. Furthermore,
    Bricolage runs exclusively open-source software, including Apache/mod_perl
    and the PostgreSQL RDBMS, so there are no hidden licensing costs,
    either. And finally, even organizations that decide to use &lt;plug&gt;<a href="http://www.kineticode.com/" title="Kineticode">professional
    consulting services</a>&lt;/plug&gt; for their Bricolage implementations
    find that the expense tends to be around half what it costs for the
    rollout of a commercial content-management solution.</p>
  


<h3>Who Uses Bricolage?</h3>

<p>Despite its genesis in the online news niche, Bricolage has managed it to
go into production in a variety of settings. This success is a function of its
broad feature-set, as well as the regard it has gained from <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,652977,00.asp" title="eWeek Reviews
Bricolage">the press</a>. So who uses it?</p>
