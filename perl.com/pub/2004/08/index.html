<p>
I've found the experiences of dancing and programming to have a great
deal in common.  With both I am immersed in an abstract world of
animated structures, building up and breaking down many times before
finally reaching a conclusion.  Indeed, when the operation of even the
dullest data-munging computer program is visualized, for example in a
debugger, it does seem to be dancing around its loops and conditions --
moving in patterns through time.</p>
<p>
In other words, a musical score is a kind of source code, and a
musical performance is a kind of running program.  When you play from
a musical score or run a program you are bringing instructions to
life.</p>
<p>
So a piece of composed music is like a Perl script, but let's not
forget improvised music.  The rules behind improvised music -- for
example improvised jazz -- develop during a performance, perhaps with
little or no predefined plan.  Where is the comparison with code here?
Well, how many times have you sat down to write some Perl without
first deciding exactly how you were going to structure it?  Perl is
great for improvising.  The question is, can you write improvised Perl
scripts on stage?  This article hopes to answer this question.</p>


<h3>Consumer Software v. Live Programming</h3>

<p>
If music and software have so much in common, how do they commonly
meet?  Well, modern-day music is often composed not at a piano but at
a computer.  Here the limits of composition are defined by the
creators of software, with musicians eagerly waiting for the next upgrade
of their favorite music application.  However, at the fringes of
electronic music, you find musicians who are also programmers, writing
their own software to generate their music.  This is a diverse world,
spanning and mixing all the genres you could think of, from classical
cantata form to speed garage to dance hall.  Very few of these
musicians have chosen Perl to write their musical code, but this
article hopes to encourage more Perl hackers to turn their tools to
music.</p>
<p>
A little about myself -- I'm a musician who for the last few years has
used Perl as my only musical instrument.  I've had some successes,
with hundreds of people dancing to my Perl, jumping about to my
subroutines, whooping as I started up a new script.  To this end, I
built a whole library of little compositional Perl scripts that I ran
together to make music.  However, when running my Perl scripts during
a performance I grew to feel as if I wasn't really performing -- I was
running software I'd written earlier, so to some extent the
performance was pre-prepared.  I could tweak parameters and so on, but
the underlying structure was dictated by my software.  So what's the
alternative?</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of months, I've moved toward writing software
live, in front of an audience.  If a programmer is onstage,
then they should program!  This may seem a little extreme, but I'm not
the only one making music this way.  This approach grew through a
collaboration with Adrian Ward called "slub," and also from a
fast-growing organization called TOPLAP, the Temporary Organisation
for the Promotion of Live Algorithm Programming.  Check
<a href="http://toplap.org/">http://toplap.org/</a> for more information.</p>
<p>
I'll introduce my live-programming environment -- "feedback.pl" --later.
First, I'll talk a little about writing code that generates music.</p>


<h3>Generative Music in Practice</h3>

<p>
When I use the phrase Perl Music, I mean music that is generated live
by Perl code.  Instead of writing a melodic sequence by hand, a Perl
Musician writes a Perl script that algorithmically generates a melody.
When making music in this way, the composer is taking a step back from
the music, working with the structure behind a composition rather than
with the composition itself.  This approach is often termed
"Generative music."</p>
<p>
Perl hackers know that programming is a creative endeavour.  So
instead of starting with someone else's software, why not start with
nothing apart from some vague musical idea?  Then sit down and start
to express that idea as code.</p>
<p>
Now, while musical Perl code doesn't have to be complicated, it
doesn't have to make sense either, you don't have to plan on making
anything that is at all readable the next day.  Saying that, to take
full advantage of any inspiration you have found, code needs to be
written very quickly, so keen programming skills and good knowledge of
Perl is of great advantage.</p>
<p>
In any case, the most important thing is that your code makes a
musical pattern that you judge to be good.  Sometimes elegant
mathematical forms sound good, other times unexpected bugs and chaotic
nonsense produce the most interesting results.</p>
<p>
Let's sidetrack to talk a little about how you might build an
environment to make live Perl music, starting with a brief tour
around some useful CPAN modules.</p>


<h3>CPAN Music Modules</h3>

<p>
Sadly Perl isn't quite fast enough to be useful for synthesizing
sounds directly.  Instead we have to use Perl to trigger sounds by
talking to other bits of software or hardware.</p>
<p>
There are a fair few music related Perl modules to be found on CPAN,
perhaps the best known being the MIDI-Perl package by Sean Burke.
MIDI-Perl concerns itself only with the reading and writing of MIDI
files, which are a kind of musical score - this article is concerned
with making live music, not writing scores.  However, if you do want
to create or manipulate MIDI files, the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MIDI::Simple"><code>MIDI::Simple</code></a> module in the
MIDI-Perl package is a great place to start.</p>
<p>
As well as a file format for storing musical scores, MIDI also
provides a real time protocol for triggering sounds on synthesizers
and samplers in real time.  If you have a MIDI compatible synthesizer
or sampler then there are CPAN modules to help you take advantage of
them; <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MIDI::Music"><code>MIDI::Music</code></a> for UNIX and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Win32API::MIDI"><code>Win32API::MIDI</code></a> for Windows.</p>
<p>
Software synthesizers are now commonplace and reliable, thanks to the
increasing speed of computers and improving latency times of operating
systems including the Linux kernel.  Most music software is still
controllable by MIDI, but for a faster and more modern alternative,
have a look at Open Sound Control (OSC).</p>
<p>
OSC is an open network protocol for music, and is well supported by
the best free software music applications including pure-data,
SuperCollider and CSound.  It's most commonly carried over UDP, so you
can use your existing TCP/IP network and Internet connection for OSC.</p>
<p>
For sending and receiving OSC messages with Perl, install the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Audio::OSC"><code>Audio::OSC</code></a> package from CPAN.  Here's an example of its use:</p>
<pre><code>
  my $osc = 
      Audio::OSC::Client-&gt;new(Host =&gt; 'localhost', Port =&gt; 57120);
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
  $osc-&gt;send(['#bundle', time() + 0.25, ['/play', 'i', "60"]]);
</code></pre>
<p>
This example sends a message to port 57120 telling it to play number
60 in a quarter of a second's time.  The OSC protocol doesn't define
the meaning of such commands, it's up to you to make sure that the
receiving application understands what the sending application is
asking of it.  Later I'll show the use of <code>Audio::OSC</code> to talk to an
application called SuperCollider.</p>
<p>
Ecasound is an excellent piece of software useful for live routing and
recording of audio.  It supports LADSPA plug-ins, allowing you full
programmatic control over a wide range of effects such as noise
filters, reverb, chorus and so on.  For full real time control over
ecasound, install the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Audio::Ecasound"><code>Audio::Ecasound</code></a> module.</p>
<p>
While not likely to have a place in a professional studio, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Audio::Beep"><code>Audio::Beep</code></a>
is a fun way of making primitive, monophonic music.  I'll use this in
an example later.</p>
<p>
Finally, perhaps the most essential CPAN module for live music is
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Time::HiRes"><code>Time::HiRes</code></a>.  Unless your music is very intense, at some point you'll
want your script to pause before triggering the next sound.  Normally
Perl only lets you sleep for whole seconds at a time, but <code>Time::HiRes</code>
offers a great deal more accuracy.  Time is such an important issue in
music, that I've dedicated the whole of the next section to it.</p>


<h3>Time</h3>

<p>
Time is central to music, and presents a few technical hurdles to
jump.  If you have more than one music-generating Perl script running
at the same time, you'll want to keep them in sync somehow, and if
you're playing with someone else, you'll need to keep in sync with
them as well.  You not only need to make sure all the different
scripts are playing at the same speed, but also in phase - that is,
everything needs to be able to work out when the start of the bar is.
Further, at some point you'll want to change the speed of the music,
especially if your crowd are looking a bit restless. And if you want
to start up a new script while another is running, how do get it to
start at the right moment?</p>
<p>
Here's how I do it, in brief.  I have a central time server called
'tm.pl', that stores the current bangs per minute (bpm), the number of bangs
that have occurred since the script started, the number of bangs since
the last bpm tempo change and the time of that change.  It keeps this
information up to date by referring to the system clock.  By fetching
these four simple bits of information it's possible for another Perl
script to work out what it should be doing and when.</p>
<p>
A 'bang' is like a musical beat, or the regular tick of a clock.  Each
Perl script keeps its own 'heart beat', an event that regularly calls
a method called 'bang'.  I put all my music generating code inside
that 'bang' method.  If it receives a bpm change from the server it
schedules the change of speed at exactly the right moment.</p>
<p>
Well, I say that but of course computers are volatile things, and so
in practice events never happen at exactly the right moment.  But as
long as the math is right, any slight error is corrected, and so the
scripts stay in synchrony.</p>













<h3>Introducing <code>feedback.pl</code></h3>

<p>
Now as I tried to explain earlier, I like to write code live while
practicing and performing.  I should really explain what this means.</p>
<p>
I wrote my own little text editor for live coding.  The editor is only
intended for writing Perl code, but doesn't have a save function.  In
that case, you might wonder how I execute the code.  </p>
<p>
Well if you're using feedback.pl, the code you're writing is running
all the time, in the background.  In fact feedback.pl has two
"threads" - one thread is the text editor and another runs the code
that is being edited.  The running code in the second thread re-parses
itself whenever you press ctrl-x, leaving all variables intact.
mod_perl programmers will be familiar with this concept -- the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::StatINC"><code>Apache::StatINC</code></a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::Reload"><code>Apache::Reload</code></a> modules do something very similar.</p>
<p>
It gets weirder -- the running code can edit its own source code.  This
is really useful for user feedback.  I quite often write code that
puts comments in its source that tells me what the running code is up
to.  So, the human interface to the running code is its source code.
You edit the code to modify the process; the process edits the code in
response.  That's why it's called <code>feedback.pl</code>.</p>
<p>
If you want to see what I mean, download <code>feedback.pl</code> from:</p>

<p><a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/feedback-0.1.pl">http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/feedback-0.1.pl</a>
</p>

<p>
You'll need a few modules installed from CPAN to get it to work.
<code>Audio::Beep</code>, <code>Audio::OSC</code> and <code>Time::HiRes</code>.  Sadly <code>Audio::Beep</code> only works
under Linux and Microsoft Windows at the moment, users of other
operating systems will have to fiddle about to get these examples to
work.</p>
<p>
Once everything is ready, run <code>feedback.pl</code> and type this little script in:</p>
<pre><code>
  # 231
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      $self-&gt;code-&gt;[0] = '# ' . $self-&gt;{bangs};
      $self-&gt;modified;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
Press ctrl-x and it will start to run.  <code>$self-&gt;{bangs} </code> contains the
number of bangs since the script was started, and this is written to
the first line of the code (make sure that line doesn't have anything
important in it).  Calling <code>$self-&gt;modified</code> tells the editor that the
code has changed, causing it to refresh the screen with the changes.</p>
<p>
OK, lets make some sounds.</p>

<pre><code>
  #
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      my $note = 100;
      $note += 50 if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 4 == 0;  
      $note -= 30 if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 3 == 0;  
      $note += 60 if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 7 == 0;
      beep($note, 40);
      $self-&gt;code-&gt;[0] = '# note: ' . $note;
      $self-&gt;modified;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
Hopefully this should play a bassline through your speaker.  <code>beep()</code> is a routine imported from <code>Audio::Beep</code>; you just pass it a frequency
in Hz and a duration in milliseconds.</p>
<p>
The bassline is surprisingly complex for such a short program. It
could almost be the theme tune to an 8-bit computer game.  The
complexity comes from the use of polyrhythms, in this case three
different modulus combined together.  </p>
<p>
Polyrhythms are wonderful to play with but largely absent from
commercial dance music.  You can see one reason for this absence by looking at
consumer music software -- while such pieces of software are obsessed
with loops, they don't make it very easy for you to mix loops with
different time signatures together.  Writing our own code brings us
freedom from such constraints, and you can really hear that freedom in
polyrhythms.</p>
<p>
Now these simple beeps are fun, but quite limited, obviously.  You can
only play one beep at a time, and have no control over the timbral
qualities of the sound.  Lets have a quick look at getting better
sounds out of our computers by controlling SuperCollider from Perl.</p>


<h3>Beyond the Beep -- SuperCollider</h3>

<p>
SuperCollider is a powerful language for audio synthesis, is free
Software, and runs under both Linux and Mac OS X.  It consists of two
Parts: <code>scserver</code>, a real-time sound synthesis server, and <code>sclang</code>, an
Object-Oriented interpreted language based on smalltalk (sclang).  Due
to SuperCollider's client-server architecture, it's possible for other
languages to replace sclang and control scserver directly, although
scheme is the only other language with the libraries for this so far.
However, with Perl it's easy to control sclang scripts with the
aforementioned <code>Audio::OSC</code> module.</p>
<p>
As a rich programming language, SuperCollider takes a bit of learning; however, if you want to try making some sounds with Perl and
SuperCollider script.  Here it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/simple.sc">http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/simple.sc</a></p>

<p>
Once you have SuperCollider running, you can start up the script like
so:</p>

<pre><code>
  sclang ./simple.sc -
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that SuperCollider users call their programs "patches" rather
than "scripts".  Patching (or paching) is a historical term that
originally referred to the programming of analog synthesizers, but as
far as SuperCollider is concerned, it's mostly synonymous with
scripting.</p>
<p>
The simple.sc script listens for OSC messages, which you can send from
feedback.pl using the built in methods 'play' and 'trigger' like this:</p>

<pre><code>
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      # play a "middle c" note every fourth bang
      $self-&gt;play({num =&gt; 60})
        if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 4 == 0;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
You can also trigger a sample in this way:</p>

<pre><code>
  sub bang {
      my $self = shift;
      # play a drum sample for 100 milliseconds, panned slightly to the left,
      # every sixth bang
      $self-&gt;trigger({sample =&gt; '/home/alex/samples/drum.wav'
                      ts     =&gt; 100,
                      pan    =&gt; 0.4
                     }
                    )
        if $self-&gt;{bangs} % 6 == 0;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the source code of feedback.pl to see how the OSC message is
sent, and to seek out extra parameters to effect the sound further.</p>


<h3>Multiple Scripts</h3>

<p>
To have multiple scripts running at the same time, you can use my
"tm.pl" script.  </p>

<p><a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/tm-0.1.pl">http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/tm-0.1.pl</a>
</p>

<p>
It requires a spread communication daemon (<a href="http://spread.org/">http://spread.org/</a>) to be
running and the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Spread::Session"><code>Spread::Session</code></a> Perl module to be installed.  Start
the tm.pl script, set the environment variable SPREAD to 1, and then
multiple invocations of feedback.pl will stay in synch.  You can
change the bpm (bangs per minute, similar to beats per minute) at any
time, for example $self-&gt;set_bpm(800) will set the bpm to 800, which
is suitable for fast gabba techno.</p>


<h3>Further Experiments</h3>

<p>
I haven't gone into detail about how to generate the music itself -
that's really up to you and your imagination.  However, here are a few
pointers toward some interesting areas of research.</p>
<p>
Markov chains are a way of probabilistically analyzing a
one-dimensional structure and then generating new structures based on
the original.  It's used often for producing amusingly garbled text,
but can also be used for making amusingly garbled music.  Check
Richard Clamp's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Algorithm::MarkovChain"><code>Algorithm::MarkovChain</code></a> module on CPAN for more details.</p>
<p>
Regular expressions are of course excellent for manipulating chunks of
text, but why not instead use them to manipulate sequences of notes
while they are playing?  Being able to hear as well as see the effect
of a regex is rather pleasing.</p>
<p>
Lastly, my best advice when looking for inspiration is to listen to
your favorite pieces of music.  Listen to the structure behind a
piece and think about how you might write an algorithm to create that
structure.  Once you start writing the code you'll start to get more
ideas based upon it, so that the eventual music sounds nothing like
what you found inspiration from.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
This might all sound like a rather strange and tortured way of making
music, but actually the opposite is true.  It's not strange, there is
structure behind every piece of music, and it's quite normal for
composers to think of the composition of this structure in terms of a
defined process.  The classic example is of Mozart using dice to
generate tunes.  It's not tortured either.  Thanks to Perl, music
generating code can be extremely fast to work with.</p>
<p>
The aims of all this are many and varied.  One is to make people dance
to Perl code, another is to be able to jam freely with others, not
only laptop musicians but also drummers, singers and other 'real'
musicians.  Indeed, although programming does allow a certain unique
perspective on things, the overall aim is to be able to reach some
kind of level playing field with other musicians.  I believe to reach
this point, we have to learn how to use the whole computer as a
musical instrument, rather than limiting ourselves to consumer
software packages.  So give it a go with Perl.</p>
<h3>Footnote</h3>

<p>
At the time of writing and due to active development, <code>Audio::OSC</code> is
not currently passing tests under Linux and quite possibly other
architectures.  It'll be fixed soon but until then users can <a href="http://yaxu.org/audio-osc.patch-yaxu">find a patch</a> that allows

<p>If you've ever had to manage a web site with tens of thousands of pages of
content where many people need to be able to update that content, you've no
doubt recognized the need for a content management system (CMS). Once you start to
manage <em>several</em> such sites, the problem becomes even worse. Since
you're reading this article on Perl.com, I'm going to go out on a limb and
guess that you're actually interested in Perl-based content management
systems.</p>

<p>Well, you're in luck.</p>

<p>This article is the first in a series on Perl.com introducing Bricolage, a
Perl-powered, open-source, enterprise-class CMS currently in production for
some of the most actively updated sites on the Internet today, including <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/" title="Visit MacCentral">MacCentral</a>,
<a href="http://et.yahoo.com/" title="Visit ETonline">ETonline</a>, and the <a href="http://www.who.int/" title="Visit the WHO site">World Health
Organization</a>. I start with a high-level overview (think <em>executive
summary</em>) of the concept of content management, the nature of the content
management ecosystem, and how Bricolage competes with other solutions in that
ecosystem. Future articles will cover installation, document modeling,
templating, and the Bricolage SOAP interface, among other topics. But first,
the basics.</p>

<h3>What is Content Management?</h3>

<p>So much is made of the importance of web content management these days that
the term, unfortunately, has been used to apply to just about any piece of
software that somehow relates to the Web or to HTML. This trend has naturally
eroded the meaning of the term <dfn>content management</dfn>. So I'm just
going to punt on providing yet another definition, and focus instead on
contrasting some of the categories of site-management software. In the
process, I highlight where and how Bricolage fits into the CM ecosystem, and
you get the benefit of determining what category of solution best fits your
own content management needs.</p>

<h4>Content Management vs. Community Building</h4>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/971" template="b/article_sidebar.view">

<p>First, there is the difference between content management systems and what
I call <dfn>community-building</dfn> solutions, such as <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/" title="Visit Slashcode.com">Slash</a> and the
<a href="http://phpnuke.org/" title="PHP-Nuke">various</a> <a href="http://www.postnuke.com/" title="PostNuke">Nuke</a> <a href="http://cpgnuke.com/" title="CPG Nuke">engines</a>. These applications
are ideal for setting up community-building and discussion sites, such as <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/" title="MacRumors.com">MacRumors.com</a>, or
(my favorite) <a href="http://use.perl.org/" title="use Perl">use
Perl</a>. The idea behind these solutions is to allow site users to register
with the site and post comments about articles, content on other sites, or
each other's comments.</p>

<p>True content management systems, on the other hand, are primarily designed
to allow organizations to centrally manage and deliver <dfn>content</dfn>,
such as articles, white papers, marketing materials, or what have you. The
emphasis is not on discussion (and indeed, most content management
systems -- including Bricolage -- don't offer discussion interfaces),
but on assuring the consistency of content structure and formatting. Good
examples of such systems include <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/"
title="Visit the Bricolage site">Bricolage</a>,
<a href="http://www.plone.org/" title="Visit the Plone site">Plone</a>,
<a href="http://www.vignette.com/" title="Vignette">Vignette</a>, and <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/" title="Interwoven">Interwoven TeamSite</a>.</p>

<h4>Application Framework vs. Turnkey Application</h4>

<p>Next, there's the distinction between <dfn>application frameworks</dfn> and
<dfn>turnkey applications</dfn>. Frameworks are not actual solutions, but
provide the tools for you to create your own solutions. Anyone who has
programmed in Java understands what a framework is; a content-management
framework provides an array of tools and libraries that you can use (or pay
high-priced consultants to use on your behalf) to create an application to
meet your needs.</p>

<p>Many organizations have bought such frameworks, and in large,
heterogeneous environments with six- and seven-figure budgets and years to
implement a solution, it can make a lot of sense. Good examples of such
frameworks are Vignette, TeamSite, and the Python-based <a href="http://www.zope.com/" title="Zope Corporation">Zope</a>.</p>

<p>A turnkey application, on the other hand, is a complete application out of
the box. It will still likely require a good deal of customization to
implement a turnkey application-based solution in a complex environment, but
we're typically talking weeks or, at the most, a few months. The downside to
such a solution is that you're limited to the features that the developers of
the application anticipated would be needed; only with open-source solutions
do you have the possibility of adding your own. Fortunately, this category of
content management is well represented in the open-source space, including
such stalwarts as Bricolage, Plone (built on the Zope framework),
and <a href="http://typo3.org/" title="The Typo3 site">TYPO3</a>.</p>

<h4>Application Server vs. Document Management and Publishing</h4>

<p>And finally, there is the difference between content management
<dfn>application servers</dfn> and <dfn>document management and
publishing</dfn> solutions. Application servers serve dual roles in life: they
provide an interface for managing content, and they deliver that content to
the final audience. This approach has advantages for some organizations, in
that it requires only a single server, document updates are immediate, and you
need deal with only one technology. Plone, Zope, and the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb" title="WikiWiki">various</a> <a href="http://www.twiki.org/" title="Twiki">Wiki</a> <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/" title="Kwiki">solutions</a> for ad-hoc content
management are typical content-management application servers. <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/" title="Blosxom">Blogging</a> <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org/" title="Movable Type">software</a> tends to
fall into this category, as well.</p>

<p>The downside to application servers is that, because they both manage and
deliver content, your choice of delivery technology is limited to the
technology choices of the software developers. With Plone, for example, you
have to use Zope to serve content to the final audience. Furthermore, many of
them provide templates for the output of content that limit how much you can
customize the look and feel of your site. And finally, performance on a
high-volume site can suffer, due to the overhead of the API and database, as
well as the trickiness of distributing content across an array of application
servers (think caching).</p>

<p>Document management and publishing systems, however, function entirely
independent of delivery solutions. They focus on managing documents, moving
them through workflow, ensuring the consistency of their structures, and
publishing them to external systems for delivery to the end audience. Content
is completely independent of presentation in these systems. Upon publication,
they push content through templates to format it into one or more types of
output (HTML, XML, RSS, Mason, PHP, etc.), and then distribute the resulting
files to other servers (typically a web, file, or application server) for
delivery to the final audience.</p>

<p>This separation allows the document management
and publishing server to do what it does best, freeing up the delivery server
to do what it does best: serve content. Bricolage is perhaps the best-known solution in this category. Another one is the recently introduced <a href="http://krang.sourceforge.net/" title="The Krang site">Krang</a>, which
is itself heavily based on Bricolage.</p>

<p>The downside to the document management and publishing systems is that,
while you are free to use whatever delivery technology you wish (plain HTML,
PHP, JSP, ASP, TT3, SSI, etc.), for security and scalability reasons the
publishing server generally must run on its own hardware, independent of the
delivery server. Furthermore, these solutions tend to have a broader set of
features than their application-server cousins. Since they don't worry about
serving content, they can provide other essentials such as document modeling,
workflow, multi-site management, multiple output channels, etc. While such
functionality increases the flexibility of the software, it can also increase
the complexity of an implementation. The upshot is that the implementation of
such a solution requires a good deal of forethought and planning.</p>

<h3>Why Bricolage?</h3>

<p>Now that you have a feel for where Bricolage fits into the content-management universe (see how it's grown beyond an &quot;ecosystem&quot; in the
space of a few paragraphs?), let's take a look at why Bricolage is a good
solution for the complex content-management needs of organizations with large
volumes of content, many content contributors and editors, and/or multiple
sites to manage. Essentially, this boils down to a brief overview of some of
the more important features of Bricolage. Once you've read this section, you
should have a good idea of whether Bricolage is right for your
organization.</p>

<h4>Browser-based Editing and Administration</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage provides a complete browser-based interface. Designed to work
      with any standards-compliant graphical browser, you can handle nearly
      all configuration and administration tasks via the browser. All document
      editing can be carried out in the browser, as well. Content authors can
      create and edit content using up to four different interfaces, including
      separate fields for each block-level piece of content (paragraphs,
      headers, blockquotes, etc.), bulk editing of multiple fields at once, or
      WYSIWYG-style editing with <a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/" title="The
      htmlArea site">htmlArea</a> in Internet Explorer and Gecko-based
      browsers such as Mozilla and Firefox.</p>
   

  <h4>Document Modeling</h4>
  
    <p>The document-modeling features of Bricolage allow you to model the
    structure of your documents entirely via the browser-based interface. Once
    you've ascertained the different types of documents your organization
    needs to manage, and what their structures will be, you can model them in
    Bricolage. All documents created in Bricolage are based on such models,
    and as such, must adhere to the hierarchical definition of elements and
    fields that constitute their models. This approach assures the consistency
    of document structure.</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/element_profile_half.gif" width="400" height="609" alt="Bricolage Element Profile" />
      <p><em>Bricolage's element-administration interface makes it easy to create 
        new elements, add sub-elements, and create content fields.</em></p>
    </div>














    <p>Bricolage document models are built into a tree-like structure of
    <dfn>elements</dfn> and <dfn>fields</dfn>. Elements are the building
    blocks of content in Bricolage. They represent various parts of documents,
    such as pages; side bars; related media such as images, lists, related
    links; and the like. Every element can contain zero or more sub-elements,
    and together the hierarchy of elements make up the &quot;branches&quot; of the
    document model tree. Fields represent the &quot;leaves&quot;, and are the
    containers into which content can be entered. Any kind of HTML field can
    be defined for use in the Bricolage UI, including <code>text</code> input
    fields, <code>textarea</code> fields, and <code>select</code>
    lists. Typical fields include &quot;paragraphs,&quot; &quot;headers,&quot; &quot;list
    items,&quot; &quot;teasers,&quot; and &quot;URLs.&quot;</p>

    <p>When an editor creates a document, it is based on a document model, and
    its structure must adhere to the model's element structure. Documents
    consist of a tree structure of elements, corresponding to the element
    structure of the document model, and in this way ensure the consistency of
    structure across documents. For more on Bricolage document modeling and
    elements, watch for the third article in this series, &quot;Bricolage
    Document Modeling.&quot;</p>
  

  <h4>Separation of Content from Presentation</h4>
  
    <p>Since Bricolage document models are purely about structure, and a
    document's content will be stored in Bricolage in the same structured
    fashion as its model defines, no presentation information is generally
    included in a document. In other words, the content of a document is pure
    content, with little or no reference to formatting. Instead, it is a
    simple structural object representing the tree-like configuration of
    content elements.</p>

    <p>The upside to this architecture is that highly structured content
    enables a virtually unlimited array of output options. The templates that
    format content can take advantage of the well-defined composition of a
    document model to grab the elements they need for the format they
    understand. Thus, a single document can be used to output a structured XML
    file, a set of HTML pages, an RSS feed, a PDF file, or whatever you
    require.</p>

<p>Done right, you get the Holy Grail of one canonical document and
    unlimited representations of that document. This capability is especially
    important in the fast-moving environment of the Internet, where new
    formatting standards are regularly introduced, demanding the creation of
    new templates to output existing content to satisfy the new standards.</p>
  

  <h4>Content Categorization</h4>
  
    <p>All Bricolage documents can be organized into one or more categories.
    These categories are hierarchical, and the hierarchies are used in part to
    create document URLs. This design allows you to store your documents in
    sensible locations on your web site, and provides them with legible URLs
    that search engines just love. Furthermore, it's easy to search for
    documents in a given category or set of categories using the Bricolage
    API, so that you can quickly create templates to generate category-specific directories of documents, such as RSS feeds.</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/category_manager_half.gif" width="400" height="305"
           alt="Bricolage Category Manager" />
      <p><em>Bricolage allows you to create an unlimited number of hierarchical 
        categories in which to file documents.</em></p>
    </div>
  

  <h4>Meaningful URLs</h4>
  
    <p>In addition to categories, Bricolage document URLs can include the
    year, month, day of the month, and/or a <dfn>slug</dfn> &#x2014; which is a
    short string describing the document, such as &quot;bricolage-intro.&quot;
    Combined, these pieces of metadata generate meaningful URLs, such
    as <code>/features/perl/2004/17/26/bricolage-intro</code> for a Perl
    feature introducing Bricolage and published on 26 July 2004. Such URLs are
    very search-engine friendly, too, so they should greatly enhance your
    Google rankings, for example.</p>
  

  <h4>Keywords</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage documents can be associated with arbitrary keywords. These,
    too, can be queried via the Bricolage API, making keyword indexes a
    possibility. And of course, they're available in templates for
    outputting <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags, <a href="http://dublincore.org/" title="Dublin Core Metadata
    Intiative">Dublin Core Metadata</a>, and the like.</p>
  

  <h4>Workflow</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage provides a workflow interface for managing your documents and
    templates. A <dfn>workflow</dfn> is a way to organize the process of
    creating a document. Typically, a document workflow defines areas of
    responsibility in the process of creating a document, such as writing,
    copy editing, legal review, and publishing. True to its original genesis
    among newspaper publishers, Bricolage workflows divide these
    responsibilities between <dfn>desks</dfn>. So one might have a workflow
    named &quot;Document&quot; for managing documents, with an &quot;Edit Desk,&quot;
    a &quot;Copy Desk,&quot; a &quot;Legal Desk,&quot; and a &quot;Publish Desk.&quot;</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/desk_story_half.gif" width="400" height="313"
           alt="Bricolage Document Workflow" />
      <p><em>Bricolage workflows can be configured to reflect your organization's 
        standard editorial processes.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>You can create as many workflows as your organization requires, each
    with as many desks as you require. Desks can be shared across
    workflows &#x2014; if you need certain parties to assume similar
    responsibilities in different workflows &#x2014; and you can set up
    permissions such that certain users have access only to the documents in
    specific workflows and on specific desks. In short, you have a lot of
    flexibility to closely model the actual workflow in your organization, so
    that working with Bricolage is simply an extension of your users' standard
    editorial processes.</p>
  

  <h4>Output Channels</h4>
  
    <p>Output channels are collections of templates that output content in
    particular formats. Typical Bricolage solutions in production today have
    output channels for XHTML, RSS, WML, etc. Furthermore, output channels can
    include templates from other output channels. When Bricolage looks for a
    template, it looks in the output channel being published to, and then any
    output channels it includes. The search for the template resembles how
    Perl searches through the <code>@INC</code> array for a module. The upshot
    is that Bricolage makes it easy for you to create libraries of templates
    that can be used across output channels.</p>

    <p>Bricolage templates correspond to document categories and elements, so
    that one element template outputs the content of a single element, or
    wraps the output of document-element templates for all documents in a
    category. Because a single element definition can be associated with
    different document models, this approach ensures the formatting of the
    content in elements based on that definition will be consistent across all
    documents.</p>
  

  <h4>Perl Templating</h4>
  
    <p>The templates in Bricolage output channels can be implemented in one
    of three templating architectures:
    <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/" title="Mason HQ">Mason</a>,
    <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/" title="Template Toolkit
    home">Template Toolkit</a>, or <a href="http://html-template.sourceforge.net/" title="HTML::Template
    home">HTML::Template</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, that's right, not only do you have three
    different choices for templating in Bricolage, but they're all Perl-based!
    In addition to being able to provide a familiar templating environment to
    tens of thousands of Perl programmers worldwide, the templating solutions
    can leverage the full power of Perl to generate output for your
    documents. That power of course includes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/"
    title="Search CPAN">CPAN</a>, where you'll find modules to ease the
    generation of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/"
    title="XML::RSS on CPAN">RSS</a> feeds, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/" title="CGI.pm on
    CPAN">HTML</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Generator/"
    title="XML::Generator on CPAN">XML</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDFLib/" title="PDFLib on
    CPAN">PDFs</a>, or even <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel/"
    title="Spreadsheet::WriteExcel on CPAN">Excel files</a>!</p>
   
    <p>Furthermore, Bricolage has a sub-classable templating architecture,
    which means that, with a little bit of work, you can add your own
    templating architecture. Anyone care to add support for <a href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/" title="Embperl home">Embperl</a>,
    <a href="http://www.apache-asp.org/" title="Apache::ASP
    home">Apache::ASP</a>, or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-LibXSLT/" title="XML::LibXSLT on
    CPAN">XSLT</a>?</p>

    <p>For more on Bricolage templating, watch for the fourth article in this
    series, &quot;Mason Templating in Bricolage.&quot;</p>
  

  <h4>Multi-site Management</h4>
  
    <p>More and more organizations are finding themselves managing more and
    more sites as part of their content-management responsibilities. As of
    version 1.8.0, Bricolage offers support for managing multiple sites from a
    single instance. Different sites can have their own categories, workflows
    (but share desks), output channels (but can include output channels from
    other sites), and distribution destinations. They can also share document
    models, so that different sites can manage the same types of documents but
    publish them with their own templates. This flexible multi-site management
    allows you to divide responsibilities appropriately while keeping all
    content centrally managed and accessible via a common interface.</p>

    <div style="width: 400px;">
      <img src="/pub/2004/08/27/graphics/site_profile_half.gif" width="400" height="274"
           alt="Bricolage Site Profile" />
      <p><em>You can manage any number of different sites in Bricolage, each with 
        its own documents, categories, templates, and workflows.</em></p>
    </div>
  















  <h4>Document Aliasing</h4>
  
    <p>Once you have several departments in your organization managing their
    own sites, they might decide that they need to publish <em>each
    other's</em> content. Fortunately, if these sites are using the same
    document models, they can. Users with READ access to another site can
    create <dfn>aliases</dfn> to documents on that site. They can edit the
    title, URL, and keywords of the alias for the benefit of their own site,
    but the content remains in read-only form, so that editorial control
    remains in the hands of the originating site. Document aliasing thus
    provides a simple approach for sites to publish each other's content
    without violating one another's editorial integrity.</p>
  

  <h4>SOAP Interface</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage features a robust and full-featured SOAP interface. The included
    <em>bric_soap</em> command-line client makes it easy to import and export
    documents, templates, and administrative objects, as well as bulk publish
    or update content. The ability to import content is especially important
    for organizations that wish to migrate their existing documents into Bricolage for management and publishing going forward. Watch for an
    article later in this series that highlights the flexibility and power of
    the Bricolage SOAP server.</p>
  

  <h4>Scalability</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage is designed to scale to the needs of the largest
    organizations. Its scalability manifests in three directions.
    <em>Horizontal</em> scalability is ensured by the ability to distribute
    the load between separate database, application, preview, and distribution
    servers. And remember, because Bricolage operates independent of the
    delivery of content to the final audience, your site's front-end servers
    can scale independently of Bricolage.</p>

    <p>The browser-based interface provides <em>Geographical</em> scalability
    by allowing users to securely use Bricolage from anywhere in the
    world. Whether content editors are down the hall, across the country, or
    on the other side of the globe, if they have a browser and access to the
    Bricolage server's network, then they can be contributing content to your
    sites.</p>

    <p>And finally, the Bricolage feature-set ensures <em>organizational</em>
    scalability, allowing for the centralized management of multiple sites,
    multiple types of documents, content categorization, and flexible
    templating across an organization and its sites. These features can be
    exercised as necessary as the needs of your organization evolve. In other
    words, Bricolage rapidly adapts to the changing requirements of your
    content-management environment.</p>
  

  <h4>Security</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage provides comprehensive security via encryption, user
    permissions, and its independence from your delivery servers. All
    communications with Bricolage can be encrypted over SSH/TLS to ensure
    secure use of the server from anywhere in the world. The same applies to
    the SOAP server, of course. At the access level, Bricolage provides a
    comprehensive permissions system to ensure that users get access only to
    the content and administrative objects relevant to getting their work
    done. And because Bricolage does not serve content to your final
    audience &#x2014; it generally runs as a back-office application and often
    behind a secure firewall &#x2014; your content library remains safe in
    Bricolage even if the security of your front-end servers becomes
    compromised.</p>

  <h4>ROI</h4>
  
    <p>Bricolage's open-source licensing helps to ensure that it is fully
    buzzword compliant, in that you can achieve a much higher return on
    investment (ROI) than with competitive commercial systems. Furthermore,
    Bricolage runs exclusively open-source software, including Apache/mod_perl
    and the PostgreSQL RDBMS, so there are no hidden licensing costs,
    either. And finally, even organizations that decide to use &lt;plug&gt;<a href="http://www.kineticode.com/" title="Kineticode">professional
    consulting services</a>&lt;/plug&gt; for their Bricolage implementations
    find that the expense tends to be around half what it costs for the
    rollout of a commercial content-management solution.</p>
  


<h3>Who Uses Bricolage?</h3>

<p>Despite its genesis in the online news niche, Bricolage has managed it to
go into production in a variety of settings. This success is a function of its
broad feature-set, as well as the regard it has gained from <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,652977,00.asp" title="eWeek Reviews
Bricolage">the press</a>. So who uses it?</p>

<h3><a name="The_Perl_6_Summary_for_the_fortnight_ending_2004-08-20">The Perl 6 Summary for the fortnight ending 2004-08-20</a></h3>

<p>Harrumph.
Note to self; never miss a week when you could actually have written the summary.
I lulled myself into a false sense of security with the quiet week for the last summary.
The last two weeks have been rather more busy and I've been away at EuroFoo over the weekend.</p>

<p>So,
this fortnight's summary might be a bit sketchy.</p>

<p>We're back with starting with perl6-internals this time as it continues to comfortably out traffic perl6-language (message count was running about 3:1 in favour of p6i).</p>

<h4><a name="Register_allocation">Register allocation</a></h4>

<p>Work continued apace on adding a bullet proof failsafe register spilling algorithm so that Dan's work project could be made to at least compile.
There was much discussion of what was actually causing the problem and several attempts to fix it.
Work is ongoing.</p>

<p>Melvin Smith coined a new acronym: DSWEPIC,
which stands for Dan Stop Writing Evil Pathological Intermediate Code though,
as chromatic pointed out,
it's actually Dan's compiler that's generating Evil Pathological code and Dan claimed that that's because he's writing a compiler for an Evil Pathological language.</p>

<h4><a name="Parrot_cvs_mirrored_with_svk">Parrot cvs mirrored with svk</a></h4>

<p>Chia-liang Kao announced that he (I'm guessing,
I'm not very good at divining the gender of none western names.
Sadly 'he' is usually a safe bet in this field though) was mirroring the Parrot CVS repository in a Subversion repository for those who didn't like CVS.
There was a certain amount of chuntering but most people seemed pleased by this.</p>

<h4><a name="The_Pie-thon_post-mortem">The Pie-thon post-mortem</a></h4>

<p>Dan posted his notes on the aftermath of the pie-thon push.
Next time we do this,
we'll start earlier.</p>

<h4><a name="An_alternate_call_scheme">An alternate call scheme</a></h4>

<p>Dan ruled on Leo's alternate call scheme proposal,
but wasn't entirely comfortable with it.
However,
he sketched out another idea inspired by it.
Leo didn't sound convinced.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a06110418bd397f6e35e5@[172.24.18.98]'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a06110418bd397f6e35e5@[172.24.18.98]</a></p>

<h4><a name="Source_mangling_slides">Source mangling slides</a></h4>

<p>Dan posted a link to an abortive talk on some of the cunning tricks we do with source mangling in Parrot.</p>

<h4><a name="Making_NCI_work_with_a_nasty_library">Making NCI work with a nasty library</a></h4>

<p>Hildo Biersma is trying to write parrot support for IBM's MQ library.
He had a couple of questions about the best way to go about it.
Leo and chromatic had some suggestions.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=16663.29639.371953.272205@saimq5.ms.com'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=16663.29639.371953.272205@saimq5.ms.com</a></p>

<h4><a name="Functions_for_embedders_to_override">Functions for embedders to override</a></h4>

<p>Noting that Ponie was already have problems,
Dan outlined those functions that embedding environments may need to override to get things working.
He asked for help and comments in getting a system in place to allow overriding functions to be registered in order to give embedders control over parrot's interface to the real world.
This is something which needs doing sooner rather than later so as to avoid storing up pain.</p>

<p>This triggered a fairly wide ranging discussion,
but progress is being made.</p>

<h4><a name="What_Unicode_means_to_us">What Unicode means to us</a></h4>

<p>Mmm...
Unicode.
Dan outlined what need to deal with to do Unicode sufficiently well.
Discussion ensued.</p>

<h4><a name="Fix_generation_of_src/nci.c_to_be_more_efficient">Fix generation of <em lang='und' xml:lang='und'>src/nci.c</em> to be more efficient</a></h4>

<p>I don't normally point out patches,
but Dan's patch to improve the generation of <em lang='und' xml:lang='und'>src/nci.c</em> spawned a longish thread with commentary from Nicholas Clark and chromatic.</p>

<h4><a name="A_small_task_for_the_interested">A small task for the interested</a></h4>

<p>Dan posted another of his small tasks for the interested (maybe we should start calling them STFTIs?).
This time he's after source tests to test the embedding interface and some fixing of the auto-prefix scheme.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a0611040cbd3da10ca9c3@[172.24.18.98]'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a0611040cbd3da10ca9c3@[172.24.18.98]</a></p>

<h4><a name="The_encoding_API">The encoding API</a></h4>

<p>Dan detailed the encoding API,
the layer that mediates between Parrot,
which sees strings as a sequence of codepoints and the underlying buffer full of bytes.
Gopal V and Michael Stone had questions and suggestions.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a06110400bd3daa20ca5a@[172.24.18.98]'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a06110400bd3daa20ca5a@[172.24.18.98]</a></p>

<h4><a name="COBOL_on_Parrot?">COBOL on Parrot?</a></h4>

<p>Remember Dan pointed everyone at a GPL'd COBOL compiler and suggested that a Parrot backend would be cool?
David Essex (if that's the British singer from the 70s then I'll be boggling like a good 'un) pointed everyone at a couple of others.
He and Uri Guttman discussed runtime libraries.</p>

<h4><a name="The_Perl_6_compiler_pumpking">The Perl 6 compiler pumpking</a></h4>

<p>Patrick Michaud,
Perl 6 compiler pumpking,
outlined his plan for getting us to a working Perl 6 compiler.</p>

<h4><a name="PMC_semantics">PMC semantics</a></h4>

<p>Leo kicked off what looks like being a long running thread when he opened discussion of the semantics of the various integerish PMCs in Parrot.
Larry and Dan both pitched in with discussion.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=4118B4E9.9070906@toetsch.at'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=4118B4E9.9070906@toetsch.at</a></p>

<h4><a name="Charset_API">Charset API</a></h4>

<p>Dan posted part two of the charset API,
which confused me slightly by arriving on my computer before Part 1.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a06110410bd4148de4d94@[172.24.18.155]'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a06110410bd4148de4d94@[172.24.18.155]</a> -- Part 1</p>

<h4><a name="Handling_block_parameters_in_Ruby">Handling block parameters in Ruby</a></h4>

<p>Mark Sparshatt asked for advice on how to handle method invocations that include special block parameters like Ruby's.
Leo thought that handling it in the parser/compiler and simply passing the block in as an extra parameter was the best way forward.
Larry and Dan discussed complications associated with that idea.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=411A83D9.1060502@yahoo.co.uk'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=411A83D9.1060502@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>

<h4><a name="Parakeet_breaks_and_recovers">Parakeet breaks and recovers</a></h4>

<p>Michel Pelletier updated his Parrot distribution and managed to kill his Parakeet language.
Dan and Leo set about trying to track the underlying bug down.
I presume it got fixed because Michel posted a new version of Parakeet soon after.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20040813112456.1bc2ec2f.michel@dialnetwork.com'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20040813112456.1bc2ec2f.michel@dialnetwork.com</a></p>

<h3><a name="NCI_and_callback_functions">NCI and callback functions</a></h3>

<p>Stephane Peiry had some problems getting NCI callbacks working with GTK.
He and Leo went tried the debugging by email trick,
but with little joy before the end of the week.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20040815205143.GA12992@pittypanda'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20040815205143.GA12992@pittypanda</a></p>

<h4><a name="TODOs_added">TODOs added</a></h4>

<p>Will Coleda added a vast number of TODO items to Parrot's RT queue.</p>

<p>His TODO about the configuration system sparked a good deal of discussion.
At least one person suggested ditching <code>make</code>,
which seems to be par for the course in these kinds of discussions.</p>

<h4><a name="Popping_an_empty_array">Popping an empty array</a></h4>

<p>Michel Pelletier wondered how to generate a catchable exception when he tried to <code>pop</code> from an empty PerlArray.
Larry reckoned that,
if it's really a PerlArray it should return an undef containing an unthrown exception.
Which sparked a longish discussion...</p>

<h4><a name="Parrot_interfaces">Parrot interfaces</a></h4>

<p>Noticing that there appeared to be ops for handling interfaces,
Michel Pelletier wondered when we might see an implementation or PDD covering their semantics.
Our resident roles guy,
chromatic,
pointed out that Parrot will actually have roles,
which can look like interfaces in the right light and pointed at Apocalypse 12 for more in the way of detail.</p>

<p>Later on,
Dan sketched out an initial interface spec.
Parrot level interfaces are very simple indeed.</p>

<h4><a name="What?">What?</a></h4>

<p>Dan Sugalski is a very,
very bad man.
Sure,
he gets a good deal of mitigation from Parrot working as well as it does,
but...
well...
Multi Method Dispatch on return continuations is sick,
evil,
and a strangely fascinating idea.</p>

<h4><a name="Span_praise">Span praise</a></h4>

<p>Dan's been catching up with his mail and popped his head up to say nice things about Span,
a very pleasant looking OO language based around Parrot.</p>

<h4><a name="Incremental_garbage_collection">Incremental garbage collection</a></h4>

<p>Leo's working on implementing an incremental garbage collector for Parrot.
The idea behind it is to reduce the amount of time the GC system spends with the world stopped.
The response was generally positive,
with discussion of potential edge cases.</p>

<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=4126558A.8000803@toetsch.at'>http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=4126558A.8000803@toetsch.at</a></p>

<h4><a name="GC/DOD_API">GC/DOD API</a></h4>

<p>Whee,
a subject that's all acronym.
That's Garbage Collection/Dead Object Detection Application Programming Interface for those of you who are bemused by the alphabet soup.</p>

<p>Dan pointed out that,
before we get a fully reworked garbage collection system in place,
it would be a good idea to get the API designed and documented.</p>

<p>Matt Diephouse spawned a subthread from the A12 lookahead discussion by wondering how Perl 6 will handle multiple blocks as arguments.

<p>Matt Diephouse found something surprising in Perl 5's handling of a return with no arguments and wondered if Perl 6 would magically solve his problem.

<p><em>Note: All comments in square brackets are X screensavers that I ran for
my slides.  If you want to play along at home, start up xscreensaver-demo and
click on the screensaver named.  By the way, for any screensaver that wants
random images (such as VidWhacker), I used a directory full of strange camel
pictures (some of which I processed to make even stranger, just for those of
you who think the phrase "strange camel" is redundant).</em></p>

<p>[<code>VidWhacker (camels)</code>]</p>

<p>Good evening.  Welcome to my eighth State of the Onion speech.  I only have
two more speeches to go after this, and I'll be up to 10.  You see, 10 is
kind of a magical number for speeches.  According to Sturgeon's Law, 9 out of
10 speeches are crap.  After we get to number 10, we'll know which one of mine
<em>wasn't</em> ...  Probably number 9 or number 10 ...</p>

<p>So I'm giving you fair warning that this is probably going to be a lousy
speech.  Those of you who attended Damian Conway's Presentation Aikido seminar
yesterday will be sure of it.  You'll probably get more out of this speech than
anyone else &mdash; mostly as a kind of negative example.  You can just get out
Damian's notes and start ticking off all the rules I've violated.</p>

<p>Now the particular reason this speech is going to be lousy is that I made up
all my slides before I knew what I was going to talk about.</p>

<p>Well, OK, that's not quite right.  I didn't make up my slides.  I was
lazy.  That's a virtue, right?  And I was Impatient.  Plus I had the hubris to
think that it didn't really matter what my slides say &mdash; I can probably
wrap a speech around them anyway.  Especially since there's only a 10% chance
that it has to be a good speech.</p>

<p>So anyway, here's my first real slide.  It's a picture of how Damian
thinks.</p>

<p>[<code>Maze</code>]</p>

<p>As most of you know, Damian is very clear-headed and determined.  He gets where he's going.  It doesn't matter what the problem is, he'll find a way to solve it eventually.  He may have to backtrack occasionally, but he's very goal-oriented, and knows how to backtrack gracefully.  It's very good that we have Damian on the Perl 6 design team, because we need someone who thinks like that.</p>

<p>Here, on the other hand, is a picture of how well I think on Damian's
level.</p>

<p>[<code>AntSpotlight (camels)</code>]</p>

<p>Yes, this is the famous Ant Spotlight screensaver.  And yes, that is where I
got all my slides from.  And no, I didn't have a goal in mind when I picked them. Do you see any goals in this picture?  Do you see any efficient search strategies? Do you see anything resembling speed here?</p>

<p>That's how well I think on Damian's level.  On a different level, I think
like this:</p>

<p>[<code>Cloudlife, fast</code>]</p>

<p>On this level, my mind is in a continual ferment.  Things bubble up to the
surface unbidden, and evolve in unexpected directions.  Everything gets
compared with everything else because the entire stew pot is bubbling like
crazy.  Well, maybe it's not <em>like</em> crazy.  Maybe it <em>is</em>
crazy.</p>

<p>One of the things that bubbled up recently was that the subject of this talk
had to be screensavers.  I didn't know why.  Maybe I still don't know why.  But
be that as it may, that's what this talk is about.  Screensavers, and why I
have to talk about them today, and why I have to talk about why I have to talk
about them today.  It's a kind of recursive problem, you see.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this screensaver is a variant of Conway's Game of Life.  No,
not our Conway, the other Conway.  Unless our Conway is the other Conway.
Whatever, we'll keep our Conway.  After all, he's TheDamian.</p>

<p>Anyway, the game of Life is sort of the prototypical example of a cellular automaton.  A number of screensavers are based on cellular automata.  I have
great empathy for all of them, because that's how I think...  I think...</p>

<p>[<code>Critical</code>]</p>

<p>On the other hand, my mind is like a screensaver that no one can ever look
at, except maybe me, and God.  People can't see the ferment in my mind.  What
they see externally has to be filtered through my verbal apparatus, which is
actually quite limited.  I often think that my verbal processor is a slow
interpreter.  My wife's verbal processor is a fast compiler.  Actually, those
of you who know Gloria will realize that she probably does her verbal
processing down in the microcode.  Or maybe it's just hardwired.  She can read
out loud faster than I can read silently.  Or maybe it's just that she can talk
faster than I can think.  Or more likely, it's just that I think slower than
she talks.</p>

<p>Anyway, where was I?  Oh, yeah.  This is how other people view my thinking.
I spend a certain amount of time bouncing all over the cognitive map, then I'll
perseverate in a particular area for a while, and then I'll take a flying
mental leap to something that seems to the observer to be totally unrelated.
They aren't unrelated, but they <em>are</em> long-range links.  You know
&mdash; all that six degrees of separation stuff.  You need the long links as
well as the short ones to make your graph work that way.  There, my mentioning
that is another example of just that sort of mental leap.  This screensaver
tends to look like a random walk generated by a person with attention deficit
disorder.  I don't have ADHD.  I tend to perseverate and not get distracted
when I <em>should</em> get distracted.  If anything, I have Asperger's syndrome, or
some kind of mild autism.  My good friend Tom Christiansen, who does have ADHD,
once said jokingly that I have "task-switching deficit" disorder.  He's
probably right on that.  Certainly I seem to be stuck on this Perl thing.  I've
been stuck there for more than 15 years now.  People think I make these
long mental leaps all the time, but they're all in the scope of this one
picture.  In my mind, everything relates to Perl, one way or another.  You'll
notice this screensaver never jumps off the screen.</p>

<p>Another way to view this screensaver is that the long jumps are indicative
of the ability to stay on task a long time.  In that view, if you have attention deficit disorder, your thinking looks more like this, because you're
changing directions faster than you want to.</p>

<p>[<code>Wander</code>]</p>

<p>People with ADHD have many endearing qualities, spontaneity not the least
of them.  But it <em>is</em> a disability, and the ADHD approach only gets you
so far.  More to the point, it tends to get you back where you were.  Here we
see a screensaver based on a random walk.  It's actually rather stultifying if
you watch it long enough.  It's been shown mathematically that a random walk
will eventually return to the place it started if you wait long enough.</p>

<p>Now, just because I say a random walk is stultifying to watch, please don't
take that to mean that ADHD people are stultifying to watch.  Quite the
opposite, in fact.  I'm just using these screensavers as talking points, as
metaphors of life, but some of my metaphors limp.  As we get older we realize
that everyone has disabilities.  That seems to be true of metaphors as well.
They all limp.  Except for the ones that are dead.  Anyway, please don't anyone
take offense at my free associations.  Even if they're true.</p>

<p>You know how people are sometimes rude on Usenet or on a mailing list.
Sometimes they'll write something that can only be taken as a deadly insult,
and then they have the unmitigated gall to put a smiley face on it, as if that
makes it all right.  It doesn't, you know.  Nevertheless, if I insult you with
a deadly insult in this talk, please put one of those little smileys after it.
<code> :-) </code></p>

<p>Anyway, where was I.  Oh, yes, random walks.  And the fact that they're kind
of stultifying to watch.</p>

<p>[<code>Rorschach</code>]</p>

<p>You could throw in a little symmetry for interest.  In fact, there's already
a special screensaver for that, which you can use if you want to find out if
you've cracked...</p>

<p>Hmm...</p>

<p>Personally, Rorschach blots always look like butterflies to me.  Or pelvis
bones, I admit it.</p>

<p>Or Mecha warriors.  And such.  You could almost swear the designers of
Japanese anime must use this program to come up with new ideas for various
kinds of monsters.  But it's still a random-walk program when you look at it.
It's value to psychoanalysis comes from the bilateral symmetry, which
psychoanalysts think will remind us of sex, for some reason.  Probably has
something to do with the fact that people are bilaterally symmetrical.</p>

<p>Pychoanalysts tend to have abstract hang-ups about sex (at least the Freudian
ones do), but since we're not psychoanalysts here, why stop at bilateral
symmetry?  Why stop at random walks?  Why not psychoanalyze ourselves with
other kinds of free associations?</p>

<p>Which is precisely what I'm doing here.  Another way of looking at this talk
is that I'm psychoanalyzing myself in front of you, using all these
screensavers as Rorschach blots to free associate with.  Another way to look at
it is that screensavers are sort of a poor man's LSD, without the bad
trips.</p>

<p>By the way, I don't think there are any Freudian psychologists in the
audience, but if you happen to be a Freudian psychologist, and were insulted by
my earlier remarks ... well ... just deal with it ... repress it, or something ....</p>

<p>In honor of Freudian psychology, I should in all fairness point out that I
am myself the subject a classical case of repressed memory.  I don't remember
anything from my fifth grade.  It wasn't anything sexual (I don't think!), but
I am told that it was one of these experimental open classrooms where you have
to decide yourself what you're going to learn.  That works well for these kinds
of people:</p>

<p>[<code>Maze</code>]</p>

<p>One of the aspects of my Asperger personality is that I don't initiate
things like that.  I have impaired executive function, in modern terminology.
I almost never initiate telephone calls.  I almost never initiate anything, in
fact.  Funny, considering Perl, but nevertheless true.</p>

<p>The most telling example of that is when Deja first put up all the old
Usenet news articles for browsing.  My good friend Randal Schwartz went in and
discovered that of the hundreds of articles I'd posted over the years, only one
article was not a follow-up to some else's article.  I don't initiate.  I have
no initiative.  I guess that makes me lazy.  Oh, well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't remember fifth grade at all.  I did terribly that year, and
completely blocked it out of my memory.  I remember fourth grade and sixth
grade just fine though.  But then, I did well those years.  It all fits.  Case
closed.</p>













<p>[<code>DangerBall</code>]</p>

<p>But now I have this other psychological mystery I'm trying to solve.  Maybe
it's just some kind of compulsion, but I <em>know</em> deep down that I have to talk
about screensavers for this speech.  But why?  Why, why, why, why, why?  It's irrational and illogical.</p>

<p>So that's what the rest of this talk is about.  It all ties in with what
happened to me last year, and it also all ties in with Perl.</p>

<p>So about what happened to me last year: I had a mutation.  That's nothing
new &mdash; people have mutations all the time.  So do screensavers.  Many
screensavers, such as this one, are based simply on showing you a mutating
object, moving around the screen.  That's pretty natural for screensavers.
After all, the original purpose of screensavers was to save your screen, and
that meant not putting the same picture up in the same place for an extended
period of time.  Of course, a blank screen would serve for that just as well.
But, ya know, a blank screen just isn't very interesting.  So we get these
various mutator objects instead.</p>

<p>[<code>Cubenetic</code>]</p>

<p>This one does interweaving cubes.</p>

<p>[<code>Engine</code>]</p>

<p>Here's a cute mutator.  The little engine that could, if you will...</p>

<p>[<code>FlipFlop</code>]</p>

<p>This one does flip flops.  Being good at flip-flops is a prerequisite for
designing computer languages.  At least, I find that I have to do frequent flip-flops in the design of Perl 6.  I probably shouldn't over-generalize that to
other language designers, who by and large are smarter than I am.</p>

<p>[<code>Gears</code>]</p>

<p>Here's a picture of Perl 5.  It's cool.</p>

<p>[<code>Gears (planetary)</code>]</p>

<p>Here's a picture of Perl 6.  It's just the same as Perl 5, only cooler.</p>

<p>Planetary gears are very scalable &mdash; you can get a large increase or
decrease in revolutions out of them.  For that reason, planetary gears are
often used in the engines of high-performance turboprop aircraft.  Definitely industrial-strength stuff.</p>

<p>[<code>Bouboule, 3d</code>]</p>

<p>This one's kind of ugly, but then it's supposed to be viewed in 3D using
those red/blue glasses.  For some reason it reminds me of my stomach when I'm not feeling so good.</p>

<p>Which reminds me to get back to the subject.  Mutations.  I had one, in my stomach.  It's a pretty well understood mutation, as these things go.  It's the
sort of mutation that produces a stomach tumor.</p>

<p>[<code>Mirrorblob, color</code>]</p>

<p>As I stood in this exact spot a year ago, I told you that I'd been in the
hospital for four days with a bleeding ulcer.  What I did not know at that time
was that the ulcer was on a tumor the size of my fist toward the lower end of
my stomach.  I did not know that I would have the lower half of my stomach
removed two weeks after OSCON.  I did not know that I would have complications,
and complications on my complications, recursively.  I did not know that I'd be
spending a total of two months in the hospital.</p>

<p>I was pretty ignorant back then.</p>

<p>You see, when you have bleeding ulcers on your vacation in Kauai, the doctor
there tells you that he saw the ulcers, but he doesn't tell you that he saw
them on a tumor.  What he does tell you is to see a gastroenterologist the
moment you get home.  After all, he doesn't want to ruin the rest of your
vacation.  Never mind that you've spent it in the hospital.</p>

<p>[<code>SpeedMine</code>]</p>

<p>So after last year's OSCON I go in for another gastric endoscopy.  That's
where they slide a tube down your throat to look at what's down there.  This is
rather unpleasant, so they use what's called conscious sedation.  They spray
numbing gunk in the back of your throat, and put you partway under.  You can
kind of remember it afterwards, but not the bad bits.</p>

<p>[<code>Spotlight (camels)</code>]</p>

<p>Then the doctor looks around, much like our ant spotlight we had earlier.
He can't see too much at a time, but he spots the tumor, and takes pictures of
it.  He can't tell how big it is, because endoscopes are monocular, and you
can't really tell how close you are to what you're looking at.</p>

<p>A lot of screensavers are based on the spotlight metaphor.  Here's
another:</p>

<p>[<code>Bumps (camels)</code>]</p>

<p>And another.</p>

<p>[<code>Zoom, lenses (camels)</code>]</p>

<p>In this case, the size of the spotlight is the whole screen, like one of
those useless digital zooms on your digital cameras.  But it's still just
viewing one portion of the picture, whether that's part of a camel, or part of
an elephant.  Or part of your stomach.  My stomach, in this case.</p>

<p>[<code>Goop</code>]</p>

<p>At this point my gastroenterologist refers me to a surgeon.  Since we don't
know how big the tumor is, I have to drink a bunch of coconut-flavored white gludge and go in for a CT scan.  I don't like coconut.  I don't like white
gludge.  But I do it anyway.  It makes some of your body less transparent than
other parts.  Some screensavers are about transparency.  Others are about
opacity.</p>

<p>Like the distinction between fermions and bosons, objects in screensavers
have to decide whether to bounce off each other or allow overlap.  And if they
overlap, whether one of them hides the other or not.  In this case, we see
through the overlap.  Many screensavers just pile things on top of each other,
like this:</p>

<p>[<code>Cynosure</code>]</p>

<p>I find these screensavers disturbing, because they remind me that with the
passage of time, everything old gets covered over by new things.  It's a
metaphor of past, present, and future.</p>

<p>After my CT scan, the surgeon calls my wife even before I get home, and asks
if I could go into surgery the very next day to have the tumor removed.  She
says yes.  So I do.  Sometimes the future is closer than you think.</p>

<p>General anesthesia is not like sleeping.  My dreams usually kind of look
like this:</p>

<p>[<code>Pipes</code>]</p>

<p>But general anesthesia looks like this:</p>

<p>[<code>Blank</code>]</p>

<p>You have no present, just a past, and (hopefully) a future.  You don't dream
&mdash; it's just a big blank until you come out from under.</p>

<p>Then they put you on morphine, so you won't hurt.  Instead, you itch.  Did
you know morphine makes you itch?  Boy, does it ever.  And you have really
weird dreams.  Dreams kind of like this:</p>

<p>[<code>Bubbles, fastest, no hide</code>]</p>

<p>Or this:</p>

<p>[<code>Lament</code>]</p>

<p>I had really weird dreams on morphine.  Didn't like those screensavers.  But
a wonderful poem came to me &mdash; it started out "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a
stately pleasure dome decree."  But I can't remember the rest of it.</p>

<p>Just kidding.  But the place I did visit in my dreams was Xanadu, and it
wasn't a very nice place to be.  I prefer normal dreams.</p>

<p>When I was awake, I thought I was choking to death because of the tube down my
nose to my stomach.  I wasn't, but I thought I was.  It wasn't until I cajoled
a nurse into looking down my throat with a flashlight that I was mollified.
That nurse became my favorite nurse, in a Florence Nightingale sort of way.  I
had several other favorite nurses too, for various reasons.</p>

<p>But then I had complications.  As some of you know, twenty years ago I went
blind in my right eye due to a case of shingles in my cornea.  Shingles is just
a recurrence of chicken pox virus.</p>

<p>So here's a screensaver called "NerveRot".</p>

<p>[<code>NerveRot</code>]</p>

<p>I love this screensaver, in a perverse sort of way.  It's so...so...in your
face.  It's unnatural in so many ways.  It looks like a fractal, but its
fractal dimensionality isn't constant.</p>

<p>I don't love real nerverot.  And shingles is a form of nerve rot, one of
those things that kicks you when you're down.  And I was down.  I got a
shingles infection on both sides of my head, which was unusual.  It took me
several days to figure it out.  Fortunately, they have drugs to suppress it.
But instead of getting out of the hospital in five days, it took ten.  The good
news was that my pathology analysis results came back saying that the excised
tumor looked relatively benign in all respects except for its large size.</p>

<p>The bad news was that I was home for only twenty-four hours, and had to go
back to emergency.  I had never been more nauseous in my life, and to compound
that, I found that even if I wanted to, I couldn't upchuck due to spasms in my
esophagus.  If you've ever had a tube down your nose, you'll know that you
never want to have one again, but I was so miserable that I asked for one.  It
was a great improvement.</p>

<p>[<code>Compass</code>]</p>

<p>This screensaver was written to be nauseating, and I think it succeeds
admirably in that.  In fact, it really bugs me that I don't know why it has two
needles pointing in different directions.  I had far too many needles going in
various directions when I was in the hospital.  I hope that other needle there
isn't the altimeter.</p>

<p>Anyway, this reminds us that an open source project needs a leader who has a
good sense of direction, who doesn't change his mind continually about things
like, say, how double-quoted strings ought to process interpolations, or which
bits of the parser should work top down, and which bottom up.  If you can find
such a leader for Perl 6, that would definitely be an improvement over me.  At
least in some respects.  Of course, I have the advantage of rules one and two.
Rule 1: Larry is always right.  Rule 2: Larry will still be right even after he
changes his mind.  Now I'm thinking there should also be a Rule 3, just in
case.  Rule 3 would say that Larry does not need to continue to be right after
he's dead.</p>













<p>[<code>BSOD "Blue Screen of Death"</code>]</p>

<p>I was sure I was dying.  I went back into the hospital, and stayed there for
weeks.  The bad news was that my surgery site had scarred up, and I couldn't
eat or drink anything.  I got all my nutrients and fluids through an IV
line.</p>

<p>The good news was that if I waited long enough, it might open up again of
its own accord.</p>

<p>That bad news was that after several weeks, it didn't.</p>

<p>The good news was that they had ways of putting tubes in to bypass the
obstruction.  So I had more procedures.</p>

<p>The bad news was the procedures didn't work.</p>

<p>The good news was that they had a way to revise the first surgery.</p>

<p>The bad news was that fixing the first surgery meant going through surgery
all over again six weeks after my first surgery.  Meanwhile, I spent a lot of
time idling.</p>

<p>I think I started developing an empathy for screensavers about that time.
The poor things just have to sit there and twiddle their thumbs.  I was
simultaneously bored and unable to concentrate.  My friends sent me books that
I couldn't read.  The only thing I could concentrate on long enough was
crossword puzzles.  With a crossword puzzle, you can quit after a clue or two,
and still make overall progress, even if your brain is crashing every few
minutes.  As mine was at that point.</p>

<p>This particular screensaver fools me more often than I care to admit.  The
problem is that the more computers you've used, the more different kinds of
crashes you've seen.  And mentally, you classify them all in the "Oh, shit!"
category, which is a category the brain is very efficient at processing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the part of your brain that says, "Hey, that's the crash
screen for a different operating system, dufus!" &mdash; that part operates at
a much slower pace.  This is actually a profound psychological truth.  Back in
the heyday of Prolog, everyone was bragging about how many LIPs they were able
to process.  That's logical inferences per second.  But your brain applies many
different LIPs ratings depending on how urgent the problem seems to be. The
brain is chock full of shortcuts, and orthogonality be screwed.  Optimizers
cheat, and sometimes they get caught cheating.  With this screensaver, you can
catch your own brain's optimizer cheating.</p>

<p>[<code>Pedal</code>]</p>

<p>I got to go home for a week before my second surgery.  I could even walk
around my neighborhood with a portable IV pack on my back.  I remember admiring
some of the flowers in the neighborhood.  They were a welcome sight after the
hospital.  But, you know, it's really scary getting all your food and water
through a tube.  Especially the water.  I got to be home for my birthday, but I
couldn't eat anything.  Well, OK, I cheated.  I ate one Popsicle, and watched
it drain back out of my stomach tube.  At least it tasted good.</p>

<p>[<code>Blank</code>]</p>

<p>My second surgery was a success.  Eventually.  I had to go through the same
morphine rigmarole again.   At least this time they put in a stomach drain
tube so I didn't have to put up with a nose tube.  But I had complications
again, this time with some internal bleeding.  I lost enough blood that they
were seriously considering giving me a transfusion.  But I squeaked through,
and eventually came home.  This time I had a feeding tube, which was in some
ways an improvement over an IV, and in other ways not.  In particular, I was
now housebound, because the stomach feeding pump was not as portable as the IV
pump.  I had to make do with fake foliage on my computer screen.</p>

<p>[<code>Forest</code>]</p>

<p>This screensaver makes use of an ancient technique.  If you're working in an
opaque medium such as oil paint, draw the background first.  Then paint the
foreground over that.  This may seem like cheating, but we use rules of thumb
like this all the time.  Every time you do lexical scoping, you're treating the
outer lexical scope like a background, and the inner lexical scope like a
foreground.  That's why it's so natural to talk about an inner variable hiding
an outer variable of the same name.</p>

<p>Can you begin to see why I have a special mental relationship with these
screensavers?  Maybe I'm a little bit crazy, but I can't decide if it's
psychotic or neurotic.  You know the difference, don't you?  A psychotic thinks
that 2 + 2 = 5.  A neurotic knows that 2 + 2 = 4, but it makes him nervous.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just a simple, everyday obsession.</p>

<p>Eventually, I learned to eat again, and got off my feeding tube.  I'll never
take eating for granted again.  I'll never take tubes for granted again either.
Now that I'm out of the hospital, here's what my dreams look like:</p>

<p>[<code>Pipes</code>]</p>

<p>Only they mean something different now.</p>

<p>[<code>Endgame</code>]</p>

<p>I recovered pretty rapidly, physically speaking.  But it took months to
really get back into gear mentally.  Not until this spring did I feel like I
was competent to write Apocalypse 12, the one about object-oriented Perl.  All
in all, I'd estimate that my little medical escapade set the Perl 6 design back
six months or so.  But Apocalypse 12 was the last big hurdle.  With that, the
design of Perl 6 can be said to be largely complete.</p>

<p>We are now in the endgame, which is the name of this screensaver.  Now that
the Parrot engine is in such fine shape, it's time to concentrate on writing a
fine Perl 6 compiler to target it.</p>

<p>[<code>Anemone</code>]</p>

<p>Open source projects start out small and grow over time.  They send out
tendrils in directions you don't expect.  Perl started as a text-processing
language.  Look, now it's a system-administration language.  And look over there,
now it's a web-programming language, too.  Oh, wait, now it's for genomics research.</p>

<p>You'll note sometimes the tendrils withdraw, like a squid's tentacles.
That's just the natural process of deciding which things belong in the core.
In squid terms, what to eat.  Perl has eaten a number of things in the last
15 years.  Some of them caused indigestion, but hey, that's life.</p>

<p>You'll notice it's cyclical.  All successful open-source projects go through
periods of expansion followed by periods of redesign and reintegration.  It's a
natural cycle.  You just have to try and not starve while you're molting.  Perl
has been molting for a few years now.  Or maybe it's been more of a
metamorphosis in a cocoon.  Anyway, Perl 6 is going to start emerging this
year.  It's going to be exciting.</p>

<p>[<code>Atlantis</code>]</p>

<p>You might say we're going to have a whale of a time.</p>

<p>The latest National Geographic has an article about squid who change their
colors.  Often they have reasons for changing, but sometimes I think they just
change for the heck of it.  A couple of years ago I was snorkeling in the
Bahamas, and got to watch a school of cuttlefish swimming along.  They weren't
hiding or courting or anything like that, but as they swam along they would all
change color to brown, then yellow, then red, then green.  It's like, "Hey
guys, wouldn't it be cool if we all ran the same screensaver at the same time?" Sort of a cultural identity thing, I suppose.</p>

<p>The interesting thing was that while I was watching, they forked.  You know,
like BSD.  One group of cuttlefish went off one way, and the other group went
off another.  Maybe they had a personality conflict.  Maybe they had a fight
over licensing.  I dunno.  But the cool thing was that the moment they forked,
they desynchronized their screensavers.  This group wanted to stay green, while
the other group wanted to go on and try out some purple.  Who knows what goes
on in the mind of a cuttlefish &mdash; it's possible that they split
specifically over the color issue.  Wouldn't be the first open-source project
to split over the color of the bike shed.</p>

<p>I predict that within 10 years, we'll have clothing that runs screensavers,
and what's more, we'll have gangs of people running around with synchronized
displays to show that they "belong."  Schools will then outlaw gang
screensavers, and impose uniform screensavers on their students.  Someone will
hack into your clothes processor just to get you into trouble with the
teachers.  Norton and McAfee will sell software to make sure your clothes keep
saying what you want them to say, and not what someone else wants them to say.
Or show...</p>

<p>Or maybe by then your shirt will be able to authenticate all the IPv6
addresses it communicates with.  The hard part is going the other way &mdash;
how are you going to authenticate your shirt to someone else?  Are you going to
bother to set up an unspoofable identity for every shirt in your closet?</p>

<p>Of course, if your shirt is programmable, you really only need one of them.
Or maybe you need two, for when the other one is in the wash.  I suppose geeks
can get away with owning a single programmable shirt.  For some definition of
"get away with."  Maybe it's more like "get away <em>from</em>," as in "get
away from me."</p>

<p>[<code>Molecule (sucrose)</code>]</p>

<p>Anyway, that's another talk.  In fact, it's a talk I already gave five years
ago.  Some of you will recognize this screensaver.  It wasn't a screensaver yet
when I gave my third State of the Onion talk, but now it is.  That's progress.
Cool.  But watch out for those pheromones.  And if you're on a low-carb diet,
don't even think about looking at this picture of sugar.</p>

<p>Well, enough about chemistry.  I already talked about that once.  If I start
repeating myself, you'll think I'm getting old.  (I <em>am</em> getting old,
but I don't want you to think it.)  Anyway, you want to hear something fresh.
Fresher than a geek's T-shirt, anyway.</p>

<p>In any event, the real geeks will probably just have the screen tattooed on
their chest.  Or their stomachs.  Teletubbies "R" us.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to freshness.</p>

<p>Now, there's two ways one can go about keeping a fresh outlook on life.  One
way that works, or at least works for some people, is to suddenly change course
in midstream.  Call it the worms approach.</p>

<p>[<code>Shadebobs</code>]</p>

<p>The problem with worms is that they don't learn much from history.  The only
history they remember is where they just were, which is where they don't want
to be now.  I've known some people like that.</p>

<p>The other approach to keeping fresh it to not be quite so, um, random.  In
other words, learn a little more from history.  You can do that either by depth
or by breadth.  In any case you're keeping more history state around than just
a single position.</p>













<p>[<code>Demon, slow</code>]</p>

<p>Software projects have history, and state.  Here you see various software projects feeding on the disorder around them.  I'd like to think some of them
are open-source projects, but doubtless some of the more aggressive ones are
closed source.</p>

<p>[<code>Demon, fast</code>]</p>

<p>Over the long term, this is also a view of how dominant species tend to wipe
out their smaller competitors.  This is also, unfortunately, a picture of where
the business world is heading these days.  At the rate we're going, we'll end
up with just a few large corporate players because right now we have the best
government big business can buy.  You can see just a few little holdouts that
survive in tiny ecological niches only because they're parasitic on the large
beasts.</p>

<p>Notice also that nearly all the original information has been destroyed in
the name of progress.  Archeologists will have to study the leftover crumbs, as
they always have.  Necessarily, they will over-generalize, just as historians
always over-generalize.  That's all you can do when too much has been forgotten.
Of course, I'm over-generalizing about history here.  But screensavers that
forget things make me sad.</p>

<p>Speaking of history, I recently got to see Tom Stoppard's play,
<em>Arcadia</em>.  I should say, I got to see it <em>again</em>.  Every time
around, I get something a little different from it.  It's an iterated
algorithm.</p>

<p>For another example, take Perl.  Paul Graham has opined (Hi, Paul) that
there are a lot of spectacularly original ideas in Perl, but I'd like to
correct that impression.  There are indeed a few original ideas in Perl, but
most of the ideas were stolen.  Perl has learned a spectacular number of things
from history.  Paul was right about one thing, though &mdash; some of the things
Perl learned from history were spectacularly <em>wrong</em>.  That's not to say
that some of my original ideas weren't also spectacularly wrong.  But hey,
that's what iterated algorithms are for.  "Release early, release often" is the
old phrase.  The new catchphrase seems to be "Learning in Public."  Same sort
of thing.</p>

<p>[At this point I skipped to the final section for lack of time, but you can
see the rest of my padding material here.]</p>

<p>[<code>Triangle</code>]</p>

<p>This makes some pretty good-looking mountains.	It cheats, of course,
compared to how Mother Nature does it.	This sort of algorithm doesn't simulate
plate tectonics or erosion, so you're not going to get good mountain ranges or
river valleys out of it.  But our computers are still far too slow to do
adequate simulation of all of physics, so we live in an era where "as good as
we can do" has to be "good enough."	The brute-force approach would often take
too long, so our algorithms tend to cheat all over the place.  In the case of a
fractal landscape like this, that can actually be a psychological advantage,
insofar as the artificial landscape comes out with a slightly alien feel, which
people seem to like, in moderation.</p>

<p>The problem with exploring oversimplifications, however, is that they're not
actually as interesting as real life over the long haul.  At least, not
individually.  Maybe there are enough oversimplifications to explore that they
emulate the richness of reality merely by being sufficiently different from
each other.  Certainly all the books ever written don't add up to the
complexity of the universe, since obviously they're a part of it.  And yet
through the power of imagination, an individual book can give us the impression
of worlds beyond our own.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how this relates to Perl, except to say that Perl has always
been about being "good enough" rather than "perfect."  Good enough is often a
lot more interesting than perfect.  It's almost as if the imperfections that
keep "good enough" from being "perfect" are the very features that make things
interesting, because there are a lot more ways for things to go wrong than for
them to go right.  Even if it's just a little wrong.  A lot of these
screensavers are a little bit wrong.  But they're interestingly wrong.</p>

<p>[<code>Circuit</code>]</p>

<p>I wasn't gonna show this one, but last Wednesday I was suddenly in the state
that it looked like I wasn't going to be able to show any of these
screensavers.  Namely, my laptop completely crapped out.  It was too late to
send it in for repair and have any hope of getting it back again in time.  I
didn't have the money to buy a new laptop, nor the time to install Fedora Core
2 on one if I had bought one.  I couldn't guarantee that I could find a
laptop to borrow that would have Fedora Core 2 on it, at least, not in time to
make sure I got these screensavers all lined up in a row.  Fortunately, I was
pretty sure I knew what was wrong with my laptop, since the power light had
been flickering when I wiggled the cord.</p>

<p>So on Thursday I spent all day dismantling my laptop to get at the
motherboard.  I don't know why they make it so you have to remove everything
else before you can remove the motherboard, but that's basically what you have
to do.  Then I went down to Fry's and bought the teeny-tiniest little soldering
iron they sell.  I went back home, and I got that motherboard out and I
soldered it with the complete expectation that I was probably ruining the
motherboard completely.  I put it back together again, and only had two extra
screws when I was done.  I still don't know what they belong to.  But it
doesn't matter.  'Cause I booted that sucker up, and it worked.  And that's the
laptop I'm showing you these screensavers on.  How many of you have ever tried
to solder your motherboard?  OK, keep your hands up if the motherboard still
worked afterwards.  You guys know how I feel right now.</p>

<p>Of course, the joke's kind of on me.  It broke again just before I left, and
I had to resolder it again last night...  I have a great deal of empathy for my
computer, having to undergo two surgeries like that...</p>

<p>Many screensavers are based on bouncing balls.</p>

<p>[<code>Pong</code>]</p>

<p>Pong, a classic.  The first version didn't even use a computer.</p>

<p>[<code>BouncingCow</code>]</p>

<p>I'm waiting for the version that does a bouncing camel.</p>

<p>[<code>Boxed</code>]</p>

<p>Multiple bouncing balls in a box are a metaphor for community.  Notice how
the escaping balls explode.  This is what happens to people who move from Perl
to Ruby.</p>

<p>[<code>Attraction, balls</code>]</p>

<p>Attraction and repulsion.  Some people find Perl attractive at a distance
and repulsive up-close.  Others have just the opposite reaction.</p>

<p>[<code>Eruption</code>]</p>

<p>With small enough balls, you start getting into particle simulations, which
are good for flame-like effects.  But if you look closely here, you can
actually see the little balls bouncing when they hit the ground.</p>

<p>[<code>Euler2d</code>]</p>

<p>Communities are defined by their centers, and often have a fractal quality
about them.  The people circulating further in are more involved than the
people farther out.  The insiders say things like, "We need to make Perl 6 the
best language for most common tasks." The people further out do not feel
absolutely bound to one community or another.  They say things like, "Use
whatever language is appropriate for the task at hand."	 The outer people are
more likely to drift from one community to another.	That's OK.  In fact, it's
healthy.</p>

<p>When it gets unhealthy is when you start drawing boundaries between
communities, and you start being exclusive.  Or worse, mandatorily inclusive.
Then you start building things like the Berlin wall to keep people inside your
community.  In anthropological terms, that's tribalism.  A tribal Perl
programmer might say, "If you leave the Perl tribe to go and join the Python
tribe, we will hunt you down, cook you, and eat you."   Or if you join the Ruby
tribe, you will explode.  By and large, I am not in favor of tribalism.</p>

<p>Except for my tribe, of course.</p>

<p>[Here's the ending I skipped to.]</p>

<p>[<code>VidWhacker (camels)</code>]</p>

<p>I could go on and on.  There are over 200 screensavers that come
with X windows these days.  We haven't begun to talk about some of the fancier
ones that you can download that do useful work, like searching for
extraterrestrial intelligence, or finding new cancer drugs.  But the ones I've
talked about today are the once I notice in my kitchen when I walk past my
Linux box.  I notice them, and I think about them, and I think about what they
mean.  So I hope you're starting to get an appreciation for them.</p>

<p>But I don't think I've really adequately conveyed yet why I wanted to show
you these screensavers.  Last night, when I tried to explain all this to my
family, I suddenly found myself getting rather teary-eyed about it all.  It's
not so much the fact that the individual screensavers are so interesting.  It's
really about how they relate to each other, and to the world.</p>

<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about 100-year languages and the like, and
while it's fun to speculate on the nature of such long-term enterprises, the
history of futurology warns us that the only sure prediction is that all
predictions are sure to be inaccurate.  The things that are relatively
predictable are not fashionable.  They're small, but universal.  Like
screensavers.  I predict we'll have screensavers in a 100 years, even if we
don't have screens any more, and all our brains take their inputs via neural
implants.  And those future screensavers will relate to each other just the
same way as our screensavers, even if they are different screensavers.</p>

<p>Think about this little program called <code>xscreensaver-demo</code> that
I've been using to show you these screensavers.  Within this program, all
screensavers are considered equal.  It's like in a hospital where all the
nurses on your floor are considered to be more or less interchangeable.  And
indeed, they purposefully mix things around so you get different nurses each
day.  But when they do that, you discover that, in fact, all the nurses are
different.  All the doctors are different.  And they're all wonderful in their
own way.  Likewise, every screensaver is different, and you can relate to them
in different ways.</p>

<p>They are so equal, yet so unequal at the same time.  And last night I
realized that this was what was important about Perl, and about the Perl
community.  Not a fancy grammar, or fast engine, or clever optimizer.  Those
things are all nice, but the heart of Perl the language is all those modules
that fit into Perl like interchangeable screensavers, and yet are all so
different from each other.  And the people who write those modules, and
grammars, and engines &mdash; they're all equal in the eyes of the Perl
community, and yet all so different.</p>

<p>So it was really only last night that I figured out why I had to talk about
screensavers tonight.  And that reason is you.  You're my little flock of
screensavers.  You're my nurses and my doctors and my patients.  You've
performed multiple surgeries on my soul, and let me perform surgeries on your
souls.  We're a hospital of people helping each other, performing random acts
of beauty for each other, even when no one is watching but God.</p>

<p>These days I may be missing the bottom of my stomach, but I still have the
bottom of my heart.  So I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart
for being precisely who you are.</p>

<p>Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Perl has a large number of command-line options that can help to make your programs more concise and open up many new possibilities for one-off command-line scripts using Perl.
In this article we'll look at some of the most useful of these.</p>

<h3><a name="Safety_Net_Options">Safety Net Options</a></h3>

<p>There are three options I like to think of as a &quot;safety net,&quot; as they can stop you from making a fool of yourself when you're doing something particularly clever (or stupid!). And while they aren't ever necessary,
it's rare that you'll find an experienced Perl programmer working without them.</p>

<p>The first of these is <code>-c</code>.
This option compiles your program without running it.
This is a great way to ensure that you haven't introduced any syntax errors while you've been editing a program.
When I'm working on a program I never go more than a few minutes without saving the file and running:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -c &lt;program&gt;</code></pre>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/718" template="b/article_sidebar.view">

<p>This makes sure that the program still compiles. It's far easier to fix problems when you've only made a few changes than it is to type in a couple of hundred of lines of code and then try to debug that.</p>

<p>The next safety net is the <code>-w</code> option. This turns on warnings that Perl will then give you if it finds any of a number of problems in your code. Each of these warnings is a potential bug in your program and should be investigated. In modern versions of Perl (since 5.6.0) the <code>-w</code> option has been replaced by the <code>use warnings</code> pragma, which is more flexible than the command-line option so you shouldn't use <code>-w</code> in new code.</p>

<p>The final safety net is the <code>-T</code> option. This option puts Perl into &quot;taint mode.&quot; In this mode, Perl inherently distrusts any data that it receives from outside the program's source -- for example, data passed in on the command line, read from a file, or taken from CGI parameters.</p>

<p>Tainted data cannot be used in an expression that interacts with the outside world -- for example, you can't use it in a call to <code>system</code> or as the name of a file to open. The full list of restrictions is given in the <code>perlsec</code> manual page.</p>

<p>In order to use this data in any of these potentially dangerous operations you need to untaint it. You do this by checking it against a regular expression. A detailed discussion of taint mode would fill an article all by itself so I won't go into any more details here, but using taint mode is a very good habit to get into -- particularly if you are writing programs (like CGI programs) that take unknown input from users.</p>

<p>Actually there's one other option that belongs in this set and that's <code>-d</code>. This option puts you into the Perl debugger. This is also a subject that's too big for this article, but I recommend you look at &quot;perldoc perldebug&quot; or Richard Foley's <i>Perl Debugger Pocket Reference</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="Command_Line_Programs">Command-Line Programs</a></h3>

<p>The next few options I want to look at make it easy to run short Perl programs on the command line. The first one, <code>-e</code>, allows you to define Perl code to be executed by the compiler. For example, it's not necessary to write a &quot;Hello World&quot; program in Perl when you can just type this at the command line.</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -e 'print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;'</code></pre>

<p>You can have as many <code>-e</code> options as you like and they will be run in the order that they appear on the command line.</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -e 'print &quot;Hello &quot;;' -e 'print &quot;World\n&quot;'</code></pre>

<p>Notice that like a normal Perl program, all but the last line of code needs to end with a <code>;</code> character.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to use a <code>-e</code> option to load a module, Perl gives you the <code>-M</code> option to make that easier.</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -MLWP::Simple -e'print head &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;'</code></pre>

<p>So <code>-Mmodule</code> is the same as <code>use module</code>. If the module has default imports you don't want imported then you can use <code>-m</code> instead. Using <code>-mmodule</code> is the equivalent of <code>use module()</code>, which turns off any default imports. For example, the following command displays nothing as the <code>head</code> function won't have been imported into your <code>main</code> package:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -mLWP::Simple -e'print head &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;'</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-M</code> and <code>-m</code> options implement various nice pieces of syntactic sugar to make using them as easy as possible. Any arguments you would normally pass to the <code>use</code> statement can be listed following an <code>=</code> sign.</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -MCGI=:standard -e'print header'</code></pre>

<p>This command imports the &quot;:standard&quot; export set from CGI.pm and therefore the <code>header</code> function becomes available to your program. Multiple arguments can be listed using quotes and commas as separators.</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -MCGI='header,start_html' -e'print header, start_html'</code></pre>

<p>In this example we've just imported the two methods <code>header</code> and <code>start_html</code> as those are the only ones we are using.</p>













<h3><a name="Implicit_Loops">Implicit Loops</a></h3>

<p>Two other command-line options, <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code>, add loops around your <code>-e</code> code. They are both very useful for processing files a line at a time. If you type something like:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -n -e 'some code' file1</code></pre>

<p>Then Perl will interpret that as:</p>

<pre><code>  LINE:
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
      # your code goes here
    }</code></pre>

<p>Notice the use of the empty file input operator, which will read all of the files given on the command line a line at a time. Each line of the input files will be put, in turn, into <code>$_</code> so that you can process it. As a example, try:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -n -e 'print &quot;$. - $_&quot;' file</code></pre>

<p>This gets converted to:</p>

<pre><code>  LINE:
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
      print &quot;$. - $_&quot;
    }</code></pre>

<p>This code prints each line of the file together with the current line number.</p>

<p>The <code>-p</code> option makes that even easier. This option always prints the contents of <code>$_</code> each time around the loop. It creates code like this:</p>

<pre><code>  LINE:
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
      # your code goes here
    } continue {
      print or die &quot;-p destination: $!\n&quot;;
    }</code></pre>

<p>This uses the little-used <code>continue</code> block on a <code>while</code> loop to ensure that the <code>print</code> statement is always called.</p>

<p>Using this option, our line number generator becomes:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -p -e '$_ = &quot;$. - $_&quot;'</code></pre>

<p>In this case there is no need for the explicit call to print as <code>-p</code> calls <code>print</code> for us.</p>

<p>Notice that the <code>LINE:</code> label is there so that you can easily move to the next input record no matter how deep in embedded loops you are. You do this using <code>next LINE</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -n -e 'next LINE unless /pattern/; print $_'</code></pre>

<p>Of course, that example would probably be written as:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -n -e 'print unless /pattern/'</code></pre>

<p>But in a more complex example, the <code>next LINE</code> construct could potentially make your code easier to understand.</p>

<p>If you need to have processing carried out either before or after the main code loop, you can use a <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> block. Here's a pretty basic way to count the words in a text file:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -ne 'END { print $t } @w = /(\w+)/g; $t += @w' file.txt</code></pre>

<p>Each time round the loop we extract all of the words (defined as contiguous runs of <code>\w</code> characters into <code>@w</code> and add the number of elements in <code>@w</code> to our total variable <code>$t</code>. The <code>END</code> block runs after the loop has completed and prints out the final value in <code>$t</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, people's definition of what constitutes a valid word can vary. The definition used by the Unix <code>wc</code> (word count) program is a string of characters delimited by whitespace. We can simulate that by changing our program slightly, like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -ne 'END { print $x } @w = split; $x += @w' file.txt</code></pre>

<p>But there are a couple of command-line options that will make that even simpler. Firstly the <code>-a</code> option turns on <i>autosplit</i> mode. In this mode, each input record is split and the resulting list of elements is stored in an array called <code>@F</code>. This means that we can write our word-count program like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -ane 'END {print $x} $x += @F' file.txt</code></pre>

<p>The default value used to split the record is one or more whitespace characters. It is, of course, possible that you might want to split the input record on another character and you can control this with the <code>-F</code> option. So if we wanted to change our program to split on all non-word characters we could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -F'\W' -ane 'END {print $x} $x += @F' file.txt</code></pre>

<p>For a more powerful example of what we can do with these options, let's look at the Unix password file. This is a simple, colon-delimited text file with one record per user. The seventh column in this file is the path of the login shell for that user. We can therefore produce a report of the most-used shells on a given system with a command-line script like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -F':' -ane '$s{$F[6]}++;' \
  &gt; -e 'END { print &quot;$_ : $s{$_}&quot; for keys %s }' /etc/passwd</code></pre>

<p>OK, so it's longer than one line and the output isn't sorted (although it's quite easy to add sorting), but perhaps you can get a sense of the kinds of things that you can do from the command line.</p>

<h3><a name="Record_Separators">Record Separators</a></h3>

<p>In my previous article I talked a lot about <code>$/</code> and <code>$\</code> -- the input and output record separators. <code>$/</code> defines how much data Perl will read every time you ask it for the next record from a filehandle, and <code>$\</code> contains a value that is appended to the end of any data that your program prints. The default value of <code>$/</code> is a new line and the default value of <code>$\</code> is an empty string (which is why you usually explicity add a new line to your calls to <code>print</code>).</p>

<p>Now in the implicit loops set up by <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code> it can be useful to define the values of <code>$/</code> and <code>$\</code>. You could, of course, do this in a <code>BEGIN</code> block, but Perl gives you an easier option with the <code>-0</code> (that's a zero) and <code>-l</code> (that's an L) command-line options. This can get a little confusing (well, it confuses me) so I'll go slowly.</p>

<p>Using <code>-0</code> and giving it a hexadecimal or octal number sets <code>$/</code> to that value. The special value <code>00</code> puts Perl in paragraph mode and the special value <code>0777</code> puts Perl into file slurp mode. These are the same as setting <code>$/</code> to an empty string and <code>undef</code> respectively.</p>

<p>Using <code>-l</code> and giving it no value has two effects. Firstly, it automatically <code>chomp</code>s the input record, and secondly, it sets <code>$\</code> equal to <code>$/</code>. If you give <code>-l</code> an octal number (and unlike <code>-0</code> it doesn't accept hex numbers) it sets <code>$\</code> to the character represented by that number and also turns on auto-<code>chomp</code>ing.</p>

<p>To be honest, I rarely use the <code>-0</code> option and I usually use the <code>-l</code> option without an argument just to add a new line to the end of each line of output. For example, I'd usually write my original &quot;Hello World&quot; example as:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -le 'print &quot;Hello World&quot;'</code></pre>

<p>If I'm doing something that requires changing the values of the input and output record separators then I'm probably out of the realm of command-line scripts.</p>

<h3><a name="In-Place_Editing">In-Place Editing</a></h3>

<p>With the options that we have already seen, it's very easy to build up some powerful command-line programs. It's very common to see command line programs that use Unix I/O redirection like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -pe 'some code' &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code></pre>

<p>This takes records from <code>input.txt</code>, carries out some kind of transformation, and writes the transformed record to <code>output.txt</code>. In some cases you don't want to write the changed data to a different file, it's often more convenient if the altered data is written back to the same file.</p>

<p>You can get the appearance of this using the <code>-i</code> option. Actually, Perl renames the input file and reads from this renamed version while writing to a new file with the original name. If <code>-i</code> is given a string argument, then that string is appended to the name of the original version of the file. For example, to change all occurrences of &quot;PHP&quot; to &quot;Perl&quot; in a data file you could write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $ perl -i -pe 's/\bPHP\b/Perl/g' file.txt</code></pre>

<p>Perl reads the input file a line at a time, making the substitution, and then writing the results back to a new file that has the same name as the original file -- effectively overwriting it. If you're not so confident of your Perl abilities you might take a backup of the original file, like this:</p>

<pre><code>  $perl -i.bak -pe 's/\bPHP\b/Perl/g' file.txt</code></pre>

<p>You'll end up with the transformed data in <code>file.txt</code> and the original file backed up in <code>file.txt.bak</code>. If you're a fan of vi then you might like to use <code>-i~</code> instead.</p>

<h3><a name="Further_Information">Further Information</a></h3>

<p>Perl has a large number of command-line options. This article has simply listed a few of the most useful. For the full list (and for more information on the ones covered here) see the &quot;perlrun&quot; manual page.</p>

<p>As I threatened last week,
I'm moving the rollover point for these summaries from midnight on Sunday/Monday to midnight on Friday/Saturday,
but rather than do it in one swell foop, I'm doing a couple of six-day weeks.
The theory is that once I become a student teacher, I'll be rather busy during the week,
but I should still be able to make time to write the summaries on the weekend.</p>

<p>That's the theory, at least; you'll note that this didn't get posted to the mailing lists on a Sunday.
Blame my cousin for getting married.
It won't happen again.</p>

<p>Joshua Gatcomb noted that the ICU that comes with Parrot is,

The ICU developers have suggested that Parrot move to version 3.0.
Josh proposed various ways of doing this.
Leo wants ICU out of the Parrot CVS,
but Dan's argued in the past that it should be in there because he doesn't want to force people to chase around fetching a raft of required libraries before they can build Parrot.</p>

<h4><a name="What's_core?">What's Core?</a></h4>

<p>Larry and Dan Hursh discussed what would be going into the standard Perl 6 distribution.
Dan argued that we should be concentrating on producing a distribution akin to the current Perl 5 distribution,
but with a few fewer kitchen sinks.
Larry argued that we should concentrate on two distributions:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Bare bones</b>:
just able to build itself and with enough capability to bootstrap everything else.</li>

<li><b>Extended</b>:
The barebones system plus a set of libraries fetchable from CP6AN that constitute the Perl 6 "supported" library; modules that are maintained by the Perl 6 equivalent of perl5-porters, and which will be supported over a long timeframe.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think Dan's been convinced yet.
Elsewhere in the thread, Luke Palmer coined the delightful acronym EYEWTIBWATA -- Everything You Ever Wanted To Install But Were Afraid To Ask -- or "eye-witty-bwattle."
I'm unsure about whether it's going to rank up there with "tim-toe-tidy," though.</p>
