                                        <h1>Why WebNano</h1>

<p>Many web applications have common components: a login page, a comment box,
an email confirmation mechanism, a generic CRUD page.  All of these are
well-defined components.  It's easy to believe that it should not be difficult
to abstract them away into libraries.  Yet every time you start a web
application you need to write that boring comment box again and again.</p>

<p>Why are there so few such libraries?  Why is writing them so hard?  There
are more and less important reasons, but there are many reasons.  Most projects
to make components eventually die the death of a thousand cuts.  Some of those problems can be solved and I believe that solving them would make a difference. <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WebNano">WebNano</a> is my attempt at
doing that.<p>

<p>Probably the most popular Perl web framework is <a
    href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>.  It is also the web
framework I know the best&mdash;this is why I chose it as the point of
reference for my analysis.</p>

<h2><strong>Controllers in request scope</strong></h2>

<p>Five years ago I was staring at the first Catalyst examples and had foggy
intuition that there was something not quite optimal.  The essence of object
oriented programming is that the most accessed data should be available to all
methods in a class without explicitly passing it via parameters, but the
Catalyst examples always started with <code>my ( $self, $c, ... ) = @_</code>.
That's not very <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself">DRY</a>.
The <code>$c</code> parameter gets passed everywhere as if it were a plain old
parameter.</p>

<p>At some point I <a
    href="http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2009/10/catalystcomponentinstancepercontext.html">counted
    how often methods from the manual use the controller object versus how
    often they use the context object which contains the request data</a>.  The
result was 117 and 38 respectively.  Many people commented that their code
often uses the controller object.  It's hard to judge this unless you can see
that code, but as my code resembled the example code from the manual, this
seems common.  This disproportion is only an illustration.  The question is not
about switching <code>$c</code> with <code>$self</code>. The question is why
the request data, which undeniably is in the center of the computation carried
out in controllers, is anything other than instance data.</p>

<p>My curiosity persisted until about a year ago, when I received a reply in
private communication from some members of the core team.  They want the
controller object to be immutable (see <a
    href="http://blog.woobling.org/2009/05/immutable-data-structures.html">Immutable
    Data Structures</a>).  That's impossible if the values of one or more of
its attributesmust necessarily change with each incoming request.  Immutable
objects are a good design choice and I accepted this answer but later I
wondered what would happen if the framework recreated the controller object
anew with each request?  Then it could hold the request data and still be
immutable for the lifetime of the request.</p>

<p>This would be a big change for Catalyst; Catalyst controllers are created at
the starup time, together with all the other application components (models and
views) and changing that does not seem feasible.  I decided to write a new web
framework.</p>

<p>I have tried many Perl web frameworks but I found only one more that uses
controllers in request scope.  This is a fundamental distinguishing feature of
WebNano.  It's not only about reducing the clutter of repeatable parameter
passing.  Instead, I believe that putting object into their natural scope will
fix a lot of the widely recognized <a
    href="http://jjnapiorkowski.vox.com/library/post/does-anyone-else-hate-the-stash.html">problems
    with the Catalyst stash and data passed through it</a>.  In procedural
programming it is not controversial to put your variable declarations into the
narrowest block that encompasses their uses.  The same should be true for
objects.  Using the same controller to serve multiple request <em>is</em> a bit
faster then recreating it each time, but that gain is modest.  <a
    href="http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/7c61aa08-d810-11df-8503-f91d06264d1f">Object::Tiny
    on one of the tester machines could create 714286 object per second</a> and
even <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>, the slowest framework tested
there, can create more then a 10000 objects per second.  Eliminating a few of
such operations, in most circumstances, is not worth compromising on the
architecture.</p>

<p>I also tested these theoretical estimations with more down to earth <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">ab</a> benchmarks
for a trivial application serving just one page.  WebNano was the fasted
framework tested, by a wide margin.  This is still an artificial test, but it
should be accurate enough to show that the cost introduced by this design
choice does not need to be big.</p>

<h2><strong>Decoupling</strong></h2>

<p>WebNano may have tested as the fastest framework because it does not do
much.  WebNano is really small. Its <em>lib/</em> directory currently contains
just 233 lines of code (as reported by <a
    href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">sloccount</a>) and <a
    href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/?module=WebNano;perl=latest">minimal
    dependencies</a>.  CPAN libraries cover all corners of web application
programming, so WebNano can provide a basic structure and otherwise get out of
the way.  Assuming simplicity allowed me to remove a lot of code required for
advanced flexibility.</p>

<p>For example, Catalyst started the process of decoupling the web framework
from other parts of the application. With Catalyst you can use any persistence
layer for the model and any templating library for the view.  Yet with this
flexibility the <code>model()</code> and <code>view()</code> methods in
Catalyst are very simple.  There is no common behaviour among the various
libraries, so all these methods do is find a model or view by its name.  For
WebNano I decided that <code>-&gt;Something</code> is shorter and no less
informative then <code>-&gt;model('Something')</code>, so I removed the
<code>model()</code> and <code>view()</code> methods.</p>

<p>I also decided to leave out component initialization.  This is a generic
task used in all kinds of programs.  Any library which performs this task needs
to know nothing about the web part of the application, and CPAN offers many
such initialization libraries.  In my limited experiments <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-SimpleConfig/">MooseX::SimpleConfig</a>
was very convenient. For more complex needs, <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bread-Board/">Bread::Board</a> seems like
a good choice.  This initialization layer needs to know how to create all the
objects used by the application, but you need no WebNano adapter to use
them.</p>

<h2><strong>Localized dispatching</strong></h2>

<p>Out of the box WebNano supports only one very simple dispatching model.
Dispatching controls which subroutine to call with which arguments and depends
directly on the behavior of the subroutines themselves.  This is why I don't
believe in external dispatchers where you configure all the dispatching for the
application in one place.  The dispatching might be in one place, but any
practical change you make requires updates in two places.  WebNano's default
dispatching is easy to extend and override on per-controller basis.</p>

<p>Writing a dispatcher is not hard; it's only complex and difficult when you
try to write a dispatching model to work for every possible application.  I
prefer to write a simple dispatcher covering only the most popular dispatching
scenarios and let the users of my framework write any specialized dispatching
code for specialized controllers. With WebNano this is possible because these
specialized dispatchers don't interfere with each other.</p>

<p>I also believe that this will make the controller classes more encapsulated
and facilitate building libraries of application controllers.</p>

<h2><strong>Granularity</strong></h2>

<p>I like the way Catalyst structures your web related code into controller
classes. This is a step forward from the <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI-Application-4.31/lib/CGI/Application.pm">CGI::Application</a>
way of packing everything into one class.  I have no hard data to support my
impression, but the granularity of packing a few related pages into one
controller class feels just about right.  It gives room for expansion by adding
new classes and dividing existing ones, and it does not clutter the application
code with several nearly empty classes.  This is a very important feature.  I
copied this design wholeheartedly in WebNano.</p>

<h2><strong>Experiments with inheritance and overriding</strong></h2>

<p>One of the WebNano tests is an application which subclasses the main test
app.  It passes all the original tests and could be completely empty if I did
not want to test the overriding of the inherited parts.  I have seen many times
a need for such behaviour, from branding websites to SaaS to reusable intranet
tools.  Too many applications solve the problem of reuse by copying code.
Inheritance has its problems, but it enables ad-hoc reuse better than cut and
paste programming.</p>

<p>Be aware that you need to override much more than just methods.  My
experiment with WebNano overrides application parts: controllers, templates,
and configuration.  It also overrides individual controllers at the template
and method levels.</p>

<p>This type of inheritance could enable a natural mechanism to publish
applications to CPAN, because they could operate with no special installation.
Users could run them directly from <code>@INC</code> and only later override
the configuration or templates as needed.</p>

<h2><strong>Universality</strong></h2>

<p>In the most common case a web application serving a request needs to fetch
data, perform some computations on this data, and render a template with the
computed values.  Those tasks typically consume 99% of the overall time spent
serving a request. The other 1% of time spent in the application framework
processing matters little; reducing it will produce little noticeable speed
increase in the whole application.</p>

<p>Even so, there might be rare cases where the application needs to serve, for
example, small JSON data chunks from a memory cache. Even when this is a small
and simple part of the application, if it generates enough volume then the
speed of the framework suddenly becomes important. Would you code that part in
PHP?</p>

<p>I was very tempted to use Moose in WebNano.  Moose generates some
significant startup overhead, though for web applications running in persistent
environments this does not matter much because that overhead amortizes over
many requests. If you run your application as CGI, this startup time becomes
important.  Even if CGI is perceived as pass&eacute; now, it is still the
easiest way to deploy web applications and (especially with the most widespread
support from hosting companies).  Fortunately, using <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::NonMoose">MooseX::NonMoose</a>
it is very easy to treat any hash based object classes as base classes for
Moose based code, so using WebNano does not mean that you need to stick to the
simplistic Object Oriented Framework it uses.</p>

<p>The plan is to make WebNano small but universal, then make extensions that
will be more powerful and more restricted. I think it is important that the
base platform can be used in all kinds of circumstances.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>

<p>It is early to say if WebNano will live to the promise of facilitating the
development of web application components.  There is a first component at CPAN:
<a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WebNano-Controller-CRUD/">WebNano::Controller::CRUD</a>.
It still bears the label "experimental", but I used it in <a
    href="https://github.com/zby/Nblog">Nblog</a>.  When I compare it to my
first similar product <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~wreis/Catalyst-Example-InstantCRUD-0.037/lib/Catalyst/Example/Controller/InstantCRUD.pm">Catalyst::Example::Controller::InstantCRUD</a>,
there aren't many differences. As you might predict, the methods have one less
parameter (<code>$c</code>).  Inheritable templates are also nice for
deployment&mdash;you don't need to write your own templates to see it working,
and later you can easily override the defaults.  There is a bit more
dispatching code, but thanks to that, the code retrieves the result object in
only one place.  In Catalyst this is possible with chained dispatching.  In the

<a
    href="https://github.com/zby/WebNano/tree/master/examples/DvdDatabase/lib/DvdDatabase/Controller/">examples
    directory</a> there are four variations on this CRUD theme.  I remain
undecided about whis is optimal.</p>

<p>The surprising thing when converting Nblog from Catalyst to WebNano was how
little I missed the rich Catalyst features, even though WebNano has still so
little code.  I think it is a promising start.</p>

<p>Recently I discovered echoes of many of my design choices in the
publications by the Google testing guru <a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/">Miško Hevery</a>.  My point of departure
for the considerations above were general rules such as decoupling and
encapsulation, where his concern is testability.  The resulting <a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/21/where-have-all-the-singletons-gone/">design
    without singletons</a> is remarkably similar.  There is a lot of good
articles at his blog, some were similar to what I already had considered (<a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/04/15/managing-object-lifetimes/">managing
    object lifetimes</a>) and others were completely new to me (<a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/04/08/how-to-do-everything-wrong-with-servlets/">how
    to do everything wrong with servlets</a>).  I recommend them all.</p>
