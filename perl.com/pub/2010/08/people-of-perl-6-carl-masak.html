6</a> and arguably the most dedicated bug wrangler.  He's contributed to
more bug reports than anyone else.  If you find that Rakudo does not do as you
expect, you'll likely talk to him on #perl6 for help triaging and categorizing
your bug.</p>

<p>In his own words, here's how he's helped make Perl 6 real.</p>

<p><strong>What's your background?</strong></p>

<p>I spent my teens learning programming by writing hundreds of small graphical
games in BASIC. A combination of university studies and employment has given me
a more solid foundation in programming, but I'm still catching up on the theory
in many places.</p>

<p><strong>What's your primary interest in Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Helping bring it from the world of ideas into the world of implementations.
As part of that, helping build up all the things around the implementations:
libraries, tooling, documentation, culture. Making Perl 6 practically
usable.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start contributing to Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>I got pulled in during the early Pugs days in 2005, but only staying on the
outskirts of the community. I saw with regret how the Pugs development slowed
and stopped during 2007, and with growing excitement how the Rakudo development
got going in 2008. My real entrance as a contributor was that summer, when I
secretly co-wrote <a href="http://november-wiki.org/">a wiki engine on top of
Rakudo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What have you worked on?</strong></p>

<p>A wiki engine (November), a 3-d connection game (<a
    href="http://github.com/masak/druid/">Druid</a>), a Perl 6 project
installer (<a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/">proto</a>), a set of web
development modules (<a href="http://github.com/masak/web/">Web.pm</a>), a
grammar engine (<a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/">GGE</a>), and a dozen
smaller modules and projects.</p>

<p>I also occasionally contribute commits to Rakudo, to the Perl 6
specification, and I regularly blog about the progress and culture of Perl 6.
My biggest single contribution is probably submitting hundreds of Rakudo bugs
that I or others have found in the course of using Rakudo Perl 6.</p>

<p><strong>What feature was your moment of epiphany with Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>I just remember being awed by the visionary tone and promise of the
Apocalypses as they were rolled out. I no longer have any memory of like one
particular feature more than the others. Since I program more in Perl 6 than in
any other language nowadays, I tend to take them for granted. :)</p>

<p><strong>What feature of Perl 6 will (and should) other languages
    steal?</strong></p>

<p>I think the new regex/grammar features will be so attractive that other
languages won't be able to keep their grubby hands off them. Of course, they
also won't get the pervasiveness of regexes and grammars just by tacking them
onto an existing language.</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of design?</strong></p>

<p>Primarily the extremely low amounts of vandalism, considering that hundreds
of people have write access to the documents which specify the language itself.
Accidental damage is also often quickly corrected, and more subtle errors get
discovered and corrected in a wiki-like manner in the long term.</p>

<p>I've also gained a new respect for what a "holistic" process the design of a
language such as Perl 6 can be sometimes. Whether some feature turns out to be
a good idea is determined by dozens of minute interactions in the spec, not all
of them "local", and some of them outright emergent.</p>

<p><strong>How did you learn the language?</strong></p>

<p>The hard way. :-) By trying to express every new thought I have and seeing
what fails: Perl 6, Rakudo, or my thought. I'm still learning.</p>

<p><strong>Where does an interested novice start to learn the
    language?</strong></p>

<p>Come to <a href="http://perl6.org/community/irc">#perl6</a>. Familiarize
yourself with <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a>. Get a pet project.
Experiment. Have fun.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make a language intended to last for 20
    years?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not qualified to fully answer that. The one piece of the puzzle I do
have is that some pieces of software out there are stale and dead, whereas
others are limber, extensible and moving. It's important to design for the
eventuality that the user of the language knows best.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a feature or a technique "Perlish"?</strong></p>

<p>A number of small, sometimes contradictory criteria. It gets the job done.
It's down-to-earth rather than abstraction-laden. It's practical rather than
orthogonal. It's often consistent in strange and unexpected ways. It favours
you rather than the compiler implementor. It goes an extra mile to be user
friendly rather than cryptic. It doesn't oversimplify. It encapsulates some
linguistic notion. It scales with your needs. It's as much about language
culture as it is about language implementation.</p>

<p><strong>What easy things are easier and which harder things are more
    possible now?  Why?</strong></p>

<p>Sub/method signatures, the type system, grammars, extending the language,
the metamodel... all of these make things that were possible but tricky or ugly
before downright easy or beautiful. Perl 5 can do a whole lot of the above
things using modules, but with Perl 6 you get them out-of-the-box, and fully
integrated.</p>

<p><strong>What feature do you most await before you use Perl 6 for your own
    serious projects?</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking forward to more speed and stability in the existing
implementations, mostly in Rakudo. I think excellent database and web support
will create great changes in the way Perl 6 is used and presented.</p>

<p>As for actual features, I'm excited that <a
    href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S09.html">Synopsis 9</a> might be mostly
implemented this year&mdash;it contains a lot of exciting syntactic sugar.</p>

<p>Also very much looking forward to playing with macros&mdash;I've been
waiting five years for them now! :-)</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of development?</strong></p>

<p>I'm delighted that what drives Rakudo development and makes it efficient is
the fact that the group of people organized around it are able to communicate
their needs and abilities, able to delegate as well as do large chunks of work
in isolation as called for by the situation. I'm thinking of Patrick when I say
that, but I see those traits in others as well.</p>

<p>It also doesn't hurt that those of us involved in development form an
increasingly knit-together group of people who enjoy each other's company, not
only on IRC but away from the keyboard as well.</p>

<p><strong>What does Rakudo need for wider deployment?</strong></p>

<p>In the time before it gets the obvious the-more-the-better features&mdash;
stability and speed&mdash;what Rakudo needs most is people who are brave enough
to deploy it in new and interesting situations. It is still the case that when
we try new things with Rakudo, we discover new bugs and corner cases, and as a
result the whole development process benefits. So we need people who want to
break new ground.</p>

<p><strong>What comes next after <a
        href="/pub/2010/07/welcome-rakudo-star.html">Rakudo
Star</a>?</strong></p>

<p>If you mean the name, there's no consensus yet. Suggestions welcome. All we
agree on is that Rakudo Nova might not fly, Rakudo Neutron Star sounds a bit
heavy, and Rakudo Black Hole would kinda suck.</p>

<p>As for what features come next after Rakudo Star, I think an important part
of the development after the Rakudo Star release will be to get feedback from
people who use it, in order to know better what to focus on next. I know the
core devs have some ideas, but there's also room for course corrections.
Whether the next distribution release will be after half a year, a full year,
or some other timespan, depends a lot on that too.</p>

<p><strong>What feature do you most look forward to in a future version of Perl
    6?</strong></p>

<p>A future version of Perl 6 the specification? The mind boggles. I think I
don't have any further demands on the specification than what we already have
in there. I'm fully occupied trying to think up ways to abuse the features from
the current spec as they come online.</p>

<p><strong>Larry wanted the community to rewrite itself just as it redesigned
    and implemented the language.  How have you seen that process
    work?</strong></p>

<p>People seem to agree that the #perl6 channel on freenode is a generally
friendly place. It's at least partly the result of conscious effort. On the <a
    href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/lists/">perl6-* emailing lists</a> you will
at times see the most informative and friendly RTFM emails you've ever
read.</p>

<p>What's still an open question for me is how these community features will
scale, as the ratio of newbies to regulars skyrockets, as the frequently asked
questions become more frequent, and as Perl 6 enters an "Eternal September"
phase.</p>

<p><strong>How do you keep up with spec changes?</strong></p>

<p>I tend to get involved in the discussion about them. :-)</p>

<p><strong>What one thing would you change about the implementation history so
    far?</strong></p>

<p>It's clear in retrospect that we should have started both Rakudo and Pugs in
2001, not years later. Of course, we had neither the knowledge we do today, nor
the people.</p>

<p><strong>How can people help you?</strong></p>

<p>By being curious about Perl 6, by writing their first little script, by
finding a module (new or extant) to work on, by reporting bugs or proposing
enchancements in Rakudo or the various projects, by bringing interesting
discussions to the channel, by interacting with the community, and by being
nice.</p>

<p><strong>What misconceptions do people have about the project that need
    addressing?</strong></p>

<p>Most misconceptions seem to me to be merely the result of a deplorable lack
of correct information, mixed with blindly cargo-culted mockery.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that working on a language design for ten years,
adapting it both to new ideas and to the feedback from implementations, in
itself qualifies as a failure of some sort. I see a language growing both more
real and more realistic every day.</p>

<p>Some people haven't been reached by the news that we actually have runnable
implementations of Perl 6, and have had so for the past five years. Those
people usually become very happy to hear that we do.</p>

<p>Others consider the Perl 6 effort as "merely an academic effort", whose
purpose will in the end only be to inform Perl 5 in certain ways, and whose
ivory-tower denizens will never truly reconnect with reality. This is the only
misconception that I, having written dozens of Perl 6 modules which actually
run, and having as my focus making Perl 6 more practically usable, can
sometimes feel saddened by.</p>

<p><strong>What projects are missing in the world of Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Nearly all of them.</p>

<p><em>Carl and other Perl 6 developers are hard at work on both the Perl 6
    specification as well as the Rakudo Perl 6 implementation.  <a
