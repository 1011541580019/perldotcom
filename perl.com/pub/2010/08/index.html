            <p>Carl Mäsak is a developer of <a href="http://www.rakudo.org/">Rakudo Perl
6</a> and arguably the most dedicated bug wrangler.  He's contributed to
more bug reports than anyone else.  If you find that Rakudo does not do as you
expect, you'll likely talk to him on #perl6 for help triaging and categorizing
your bug.</p>

<p>In his own words, here's how he's helped make Perl 6 real.</p>

<p><strong>What's your background?</strong></p>

<p>I spent my teens learning programming by writing hundreds of small graphical
games in BASIC. A combination of university studies and employment has given me
a more solid foundation in programming, but I'm still catching up on the theory
in many places.</p>

<p><strong>What's your primary interest in Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Helping bring it from the world of ideas into the world of implementations.
As part of that, helping build up all the things around the implementations:
libraries, tooling, documentation, culture. Making Perl 6 practically
usable.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start contributing to Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>I got pulled in during the early Pugs days in 2005, but only staying on the
outskirts of the community. I saw with regret how the Pugs development slowed
and stopped during 2007, and with growing excitement how the Rakudo development
got going in 2008. My real entrance as a contributor was that summer, when I
secretly co-wrote <a href="http://november-wiki.org/">a wiki engine on top of
Rakudo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What have you worked on?</strong></p>

<p>A wiki engine (November), a 3-d connection game (<a
    href="http://github.com/masak/druid/">Druid</a>), a Perl 6 project
installer (<a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/">proto</a>), a set of web
development modules (<a href="http://github.com/masak/web/">Web.pm</a>), a
grammar engine (<a href="http://github.com/masak/gge/">GGE</a>), and a dozen
smaller modules and projects.</p>

<p>I also occasionally contribute commits to Rakudo, to the Perl 6
specification, and I regularly blog about the progress and culture of Perl 6.
My biggest single contribution is probably submitting hundreds of Rakudo bugs
that I or others have found in the course of using Rakudo Perl 6.</p>

<p><strong>What feature was your moment of epiphany with Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>I just remember being awed by the visionary tone and promise of the
Apocalypses as they were rolled out. I no longer have any memory of like one
particular feature more than the others. Since I program more in Perl 6 than in
any other language nowadays, I tend to take them for granted. :)</p>

<p><strong>What feature of Perl 6 will (and should) other languages
    steal?</strong></p>

<p>I think the new regex/grammar features will be so attractive that other
languages won't be able to keep their grubby hands off them. Of course, they
also won't get the pervasiveness of regexes and grammars just by tacking them
onto an existing language.</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of design?</strong></p>

<p>Primarily the extremely low amounts of vandalism, considering that hundreds
of people have write access to the documents which specify the language itself.
Accidental damage is also often quickly corrected, and more subtle errors get
discovered and corrected in a wiki-like manner in the long term.</p>

<p>I've also gained a new respect for what a "holistic" process the design of a
language such as Perl 6 can be sometimes. Whether some feature turns out to be
a good idea is determined by dozens of minute interactions in the spec, not all
of them "local", and some of them outright emergent.</p>

<p><strong>How did you learn the language?</strong></p>

<p>The hard way. :-) By trying to express every new thought I have and seeing
what fails: Perl 6, Rakudo, or my thought. I'm still learning.</p>

<p><strong>Where does an interested novice start to learn the
    language?</strong></p>

<p>Come to <a href="http://perl6.org/community/irc">#perl6</a>. Familiarize
yourself with <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a>. Get a pet project.
Experiment. Have fun.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make a language intended to last for 20
    years?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not qualified to fully answer that. The one piece of the puzzle I do
have is that some pieces of software out there are stale and dead, whereas
others are limber, extensible and moving. It's important to design for the
eventuality that the user of the language knows best.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a feature or a technique "Perlish"?</strong></p>

<p>A number of small, sometimes contradictory criteria. It gets the job done.
It's down-to-earth rather than abstraction-laden. It's practical rather than
orthogonal. It's often consistent in strange and unexpected ways. It favours
you rather than the compiler implementor. It goes an extra mile to be user
friendly rather than cryptic. It doesn't oversimplify. It encapsulates some
linguistic notion. It scales with your needs. It's as much about language
culture as it is about language implementation.</p>

<p><strong>What easy things are easier and which harder things are more
    possible now?  Why?</strong></p>

<p>Sub/method signatures, the type system, grammars, extending the language,
the metamodel... all of these make things that were possible but tricky or ugly
before downright easy or beautiful. Perl 5 can do a whole lot of the above
things using modules, but with Perl 6 you get them out-of-the-box, and fully
integrated.</p>

<p><strong>What feature do you most await before you use Perl 6 for your own
    serious projects?</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking forward to more speed and stability in the existing
implementations, mostly in Rakudo. I think excellent database and web support
will create great changes in the way Perl 6 is used and presented.</p>

<p>As for actual features, I'm excited that <a
    href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S09.html">Synopsis 9</a> might be mostly
implemented this year&mdash;it contains a lot of exciting syntactic sugar.</p>

<p>Also very much looking forward to playing with macros&mdash;I've been
waiting five years for them now! :-)</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of development?</strong></p>

<p>I'm delighted that what drives Rakudo development and makes it efficient is
the fact that the group of people organized around it are able to communicate
their needs and abilities, able to delegate as well as do large chunks of work
in isolation as called for by the situation. I'm thinking of Patrick when I say
that, but I see those traits in others as well.</p>

<p>It also doesn't hurt that those of us involved in development form an
increasingly knit-together group of people who enjoy each other's company, not
only on IRC but away from the keyboard as well.</p>

<p><strong>What does Rakudo need for wider deployment?</strong></p>

<p>In the time before it gets the obvious the-more-the-better features&mdash;
stability and speed&mdash;what Rakudo needs most is people who are brave enough
to deploy it in new and interesting situations. It is still the case that when
we try new things with Rakudo, we discover new bugs and corner cases, and as a
result the whole development process benefits. So we need people who want to
break new ground.</p>

<p><strong>What comes next after <a
        href="/pub/2010/07/welcome-rakudo-star.html">Rakudo
Star</a>?</strong></p>

<p>If you mean the name, there's no consensus yet. Suggestions welcome. All we
agree on is that Rakudo Nova might not fly, Rakudo Neutron Star sounds a bit
heavy, and Rakudo Black Hole would kinda suck.</p>

<p>As for what features come next after Rakudo Star, I think an important part
of the development after the Rakudo Star release will be to get feedback from
people who use it, in order to know better what to focus on next. I know the
core devs have some ideas, but there's also room for course corrections.
Whether the next distribution release will be after half a year, a full year,
or some other timespan, depends a lot on that too.</p>

<p><strong>What feature do you most look forward to in a future version of Perl
    6?</strong></p>

<p>A future version of Perl 6 the specification? The mind boggles. I think I
don't have any further demands on the specification than what we already have
in there. I'm fully occupied trying to think up ways to abuse the features from
the current spec as they come online.</p>

<p><strong>Larry wanted the community to rewrite itself just as it redesigned
    and implemented the language.  How have you seen that process
    work?</strong></p>

<p>People seem to agree that the #perl6 channel on freenode is a generally
friendly place. It's at least partly the result of conscious effort. On the <a
    href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/lists/">perl6-* emailing lists</a> you will
at times see the most informative and friendly RTFM emails you've ever
read.</p>

<p>What's still an open question for me is how these community features will
scale, as the ratio of newbies to regulars skyrockets, as the frequently asked
questions become more frequent, and as Perl 6 enters an "Eternal September"
phase.</p>

<p><strong>How do you keep up with spec changes?</strong></p>

<p>I tend to get involved in the discussion about them. :-)</p>

<p><strong>What one thing would you change about the implementation history so
    far?</strong></p>

<p>It's clear in retrospect that we should have started both Rakudo and Pugs in
2001, not years later. Of course, we had neither the knowledge we do today, nor
the people.</p>

<p><strong>How can people help you?</strong></p>

<p>By being curious about Perl 6, by writing their first little script, by
finding a module (new or extant) to work on, by reporting bugs or proposing
enchancements in Rakudo or the various projects, by bringing interesting
discussions to the channel, by interacting with the community, and by being
nice.</p>

<p><strong>What misconceptions do people have about the project that need
    addressing?</strong></p>

<p>Most misconceptions seem to me to be merely the result of a deplorable lack
of correct information, mixed with blindly cargo-culted mockery.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that working on a language design for ten years,
adapting it both to new ideas and to the feedback from implementations, in
itself qualifies as a failure of some sort. I see a language growing both more
real and more realistic every day.</p>

<p>Some people haven't been reached by the news that we actually have runnable
implementations of Perl 6, and have had so for the past five years. Those
people usually become very happy to hear that we do.</p>

<p>Others consider the Perl 6 effort as "merely an academic effort", whose
purpose will in the end only be to inform Perl 5 in certain ways, and whose
ivory-tower denizens will never truly reconnect with reality. This is the only
misconception that I, having written dozens of Perl 6 modules which actually
run, and having as my focus making Perl 6 more practically usable, can
sometimes feel saddened by.</p>

<p><strong>What projects are missing in the world of Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Nearly all of them.</p>

<p><em>Carl and other Perl 6 developers are hard at work on both the Perl 6
    specification as well as the Rakudo Perl 6 implementation.  <a
        href="http://rakudo.org/announce/rakudo-star/2010.08">Rakudo Star

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>In 1999 and 2000 I worked on the Everything Engine, a website management
system written in Perl 5 which runs sites like <a
href="http://everything2.org/">Everything 2</a> and <a
href="http://perlmonks.org/">PerlMonks</a>. The system has its flaws--many
of them due to our inexperience building and maintaining large systems with
the Perl of the time.</p>

<p>We could build it much better today, with modern libraries and
techniques in Perl. In truth, building such a system today would solve a
lot of uses for MVC applications.</p>

<h3><strong>How Everything Works</strong></h3>

<p>The fundamental concept of Everything is that everything is a node. A
node is an individual entity containing attributes, including a unique
identifier and one or more addressing mechanisms expressible through a URI.
Each node also has a nodetype (itself a node) which contains information
about the node's characteristics, such as the attributes it contains, the
types of operations it supports, and any mechanisms to view node
information.</p>

<p>In other words, a node is an object, a nodetype is a class, and there's
a metaobject protocol governing the relationships of nodes and
nodetypes.</p>

<p>The Everything Engine provides a sort of routing system which might
remind you of routes in one of the new heavy-model MVC systems. In one
sense, Everything provided its own implementation of MVC, where URIs and
URI components helped the controller find the appropriate model (node) and
model operation (nodemethod), which eventually caused the rendering of a
series of templates, or the view.</p>

<p>The system provides node inheritance for attributes and behaviors such
as creating, reading, updating, and deleting nodes. Because every node
inherited from node, every node has at least general behavior through any
interface into the system. If you create a new nodetype, you can do useful
things with nodes of that type without having to write any specific views
or mess with routing or the like. You have the option of making prettier or
more featureful or better or at least different views, but the default
inherited views and behaviors are sufficient for the basic CRUD
operations.</p>

<h3><strong>What Everything Didn't and Did Well</strong></h3>

<p>Not everything went right. Remember, this system came about in 1998 and
1999, just as mod_perl was the shiny new technology in the world of Perl
web development. Object-relational mapping was still difficult (if even
understood much), CGI.pm was still the king, and Template Toolkit hadn't
taken over as the obvious first place to look for your templating
needs.</p>

<p>Our hand-written ORM has its flaws, as dealing with node inheritance and
lookup of node types and (yes) serializing code to the database to
<code>eval</code> into a running instance of the system at initialization
time. The XML serialization scheme for bundling core nodes and custom nodes
was even worse, not only due to our use of the DOM.</p>

<p>Without a well-understood mechanism and framework and example of doing
MVC well in Perl 5, Everything's custom interpretation of MVC was odd.
Where MVC helps separate application responsibilities into loosely-coupled
layers, passing around a CGI object to models and templates violates that
encapsulation. (The less said about the custom method dispatch strategy the
better.)</p>

<p>Most of the problems with the system are obvious in retrospect, over a
decade later (especially with a decade of experience creating new systems,
maintaining existing systems, and stealing ideas from other projects which
have made different mistakes).</p>

<p>Even with all of those mistakes, the system worked reasonably well in
many cases. Adding new features was easy (even if deploying them is less
so). Creating new behaviors by reusing existing primitives makes building
simple systems easy. The usability provided by inherited defaults made it
easy to iterate and experiment and refine new behaviors.</p>

<p>We also eventually produced a system to bind UI widgets--HTML, in our
case--to node attributes. That made displaying and editing mechanisms much,
much easier.</p>

<p>I wouldn't start a new site with Everything as it exists today, but I've
wanted a modern version of it for a long, long time. Modern Perl has almost
all of the pieces needed to rebuild it.</p>

<h3><strong>Doing Everything Better</strong></h3>

<p>The <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a> object system provides an
obvious way to define nodes. A node is merely a Moose object, and a nodetype is
its class. This provides a well-understood and robust mechanism for dealing
with attributes and methods and roles and the like, and the metaobject protocol
provided by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::MOP">Class::MOP</a>
allows introspective capabilities which will become obviously important
soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack">Plack</a> support is
obviously the current best way to deploy a web application in Perl 5, as it
allows reusable middleware and offers many deployment strategies.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> is the
first ORM to consider in Perl 5 right now. I'm partial to <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?KiokuDB">KiokuDB</a> for applications
where I need persistent objects but don't need to provide a relational
interface to interact with the data. The ability to use either one as a
serialization backend is important.</p>

<p>Any of the modern frameworks or libraries or toolkits for providing the
controller part of the MVC application will do. In particular, all this
layer of the application needs to do is to map requests to nodes, manage
concerns of user authentication and logging, invoke the fat model objects
to perform their business actions, then dispatch to the view to render the
appropriate information in the user interface. I like the simplicity of
Dancer, but anything compatible with Plack will work for web
applications.</p>

<h3><strong>A New Architecture for Perl Apps</strong></h3>

<p>Here's my vision.</p>

<p>I run a publishing company. I want to manage a web site with information
about existing and upcoming books.</p>

<p>I start by defining some models: a Book has a title, an ISBN, a price,
one or more Authors, a short blurb, a full description, and publication
date, and a cover image. An Author has a name, a biography, and an
image.</p>

<p>For each attribute of each model, I choose two types: the type for the
object attribute itself (an ISBN is a ten- or thirteen-digit number, an author
is an Author object, et cetera) as well as the type for the UI (Authors display
as a list of authors and they require a multiple selection UI widget to
display). That author selection widget is interesting because it can be a
parametric role: a role which knows how to display multiple
<em>something</em>s, where that <em>something</em> is a parameter in this case
constrained only to Authors.</p>

<p>Obviously I need some mechanism to define new UI and attribute types,
but assume that the system comes with a rich set of types (password, phone
number, long input, short input, et cetera) from which I can build
more.</p>

<p>My serialization layer already knows how to serialize these models.
That's part of the magic of using KiokuDB, and there are mechanisms
available for DBIx::Class to perform the same mapping.</p>

<p>Given these models, the controller layer can create default URI mapping
routes for basic CRUD operations. The HTTP verbs <code>PUT</code>,
<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> map nicely. As
well, the first URI component beneath the application itself can map to the
type of model required, such that
<em>http://example.com/awesomebooksaboutperl/authors/chromatic</em> obviously
returns my author page. Without a unique identifier,
<em>http://example.com/awesomebooksaboutperl/authors/</em> could list all
authors.</p>

<p>With the UI information associated with models, I don't even have to
write any templates to get a bare-bones UI. The system can use Moose's
introspection mechanism to read all of the object attributes then bind them
to HTML widgets for the appropriate display type (reading, creating, and
updating). This is particularly easy with a system like Moose where another
parametric role can customize the appropriate elements to render based on
access controls. That is, users can update their own passwords and
administrators can update anyone's passwords, but users cannot even see the
password entry fields for other users. The model object decorated with this
UI role can decline to make inappropriate information available to the
template rendering system at all.</p>

<p>Even better, the UI decoration role can provide different destination
output types as well, such as JSON or XML or even serialized objects
themselves suitable for transportation between similar systems.</p>

<p>I care most about HTML for this web application, but it's nice to have a
JSON or Atom view of my data, especially because I can define another route (or
perhaps you get this by adding an attribute to your models) which generates
syndication information automatically; if I add a new book, it's part of the
<em>http://example.com/awesomeperlbooks/comingsoon.xml</em> Atom feed.
Internally, the controller might map that URI to
<em>http://example.com/awesomeperlbooks/books/?view=atom;sort_by=desc;limit=10</em>.</p>

<p>Whatever the other output options, I want my HTML to make generous use
of CSS selectors, such that I have the option of customizing the result
purely in CSS, where possible. (I don't mind writing custom HTML, but the
less of that I have to do the better.) This is because it's possible to
build a big page out of several models rendered together: each model should
be able to render as a fragment, which makes Ajax applications easier to
write.</p>

<p>Perhaps the real benefit of this system is that it can host itself, in
that it's very easy to write an administrative console which allows people
to define their own models and types and widgets using the system as its
own interface. I'm still likely to write my own models by hand in Vim, but
I don't mind customizing an HTML template fragment in a web browser window
on a development server, at least if I can deploy the entire system as if
I'd written it by hand to files in the filesystem.</p>

<p>I've discussed this system with a few people and various projects exist to
make much of it work. Consider modeling, serialization, and deployment solved
thanks to Moose, DBIx::Class and KiokuDB, and Plack. What's left is some
middleware, some conventions for routing and mapping, and a little bit of magic
UI widget binding and default templates. I wish we'd had this great technology
a decade ago, but now with modern Perl we may be able to create a postmodern
fat-model MVC web framework that makes the easy things trivial, the hard things
easy, and the annoying things wonderful.</p>

<p><strong>What's your background?</strong></p>

<p>I discovered programming when I was about eight years old, and got hooked.
It started out with Logo and BBC Micro BASIC on some computers at school.
Several years and a couple of PC-based dialects of Basic later, my family got
internet access at home, and a couple of years later I ran across Perl.</p>

<p>I ended up going off to university to do Computer Science. I questioned it a
bit&mdash;I wasn't certain my childhood hobby would still be interesting as a
topic of study and a future career. Happily, it deepened my curiosity rather
than bored me. I took a particular interest in languages, compilers and type
systems, though the natural language processing courses kind of caught my
interest too.</p>

<p>That all came to an end several years back, when I graduated. Since then,
I've done a few years freelancing and living abroad, and recently joined a
startup company in Sweden. Amusingly, it makes the third country starting with
an "S" that I've lived in since graduating&mdash;the other two were sunny Spain
and the lesser-known but lovely Slovakia, a place I remain very fond of.</p>

<p><strong>What's your primary interest in Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>At the moment, I'm primarily interested in writing a good compiler for it.
Beyond that, I'd like to use it to build more cool things, though I've little
idea what yet. We'll see what comes along.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start contributing to Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2003, a couple of years after discovering Perl, I heard about Perl
6. I found the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">apocalypses</a>
engaging, and joined a couple of mailing lists. A lot of perl6-language
bewildered me. Well, some things never change. :-) I felt way out of my depth
on the language design front back then, but then found the <a
href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> project, which was a little more
concrete. I wrote a couple of patches to improve Windows support.</p>

<p>I did more bits with Parrot over the following years&mdash;mostly on the
bytecode format and some object orientation bits. I didn't really get involved
with the Perl 6 compiler itself until 2007. That summer, I went to OSCON, drank
a few beers and then told Larry Wall, of all people, that implementing
junctions in the Perl 6 on Parrot compiler sounded interesting.</p>

<p>Sadly, autumn of 2007 saw me pretty depressed. I withdrew from hacking on
just about everything, went to wander around China for a month and hurriedly
arranged to move abroad, in hope of putting some distance between myself and
things. With the Spanish sun to improve my mood, and noticing that the latest
iteration of the Perl 6 compiler&mdash;built on the <a
href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/PCT_Tutorial.html">Parrot
Compiler Toolkit</a>&mdash;had landed, it felt like time to try and make good
on my junctions remark.</p>

<p><strong>What have you worked on?</strong></p>

<p>Well, not long after digging in to junctions, I discovered that doing
junctions properly meant doing multiple dispatch... and doing multiple dispatch
meant doing a bunch of the type system stuff... and doing that meant being able
to declare classes and roles. A couple of years of hacking later, and with
plenty of input and help from others, we're doing pretty well on all of those
areas now in Rakudo. :-)</p>

<p><strong>What feature was your moment of epiphany with Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>That's a hard one. There are many interesting features in Perl 6&mdash;some
of them big things, some of them much smaller. What I've really come to admire
isn't so much the features themselves, but rather the much smaller number of
fundamentals that they're all built on top of, and how they them form a
coherent whole that is greater than its parts.</p>

<p><strong>What feature of Perl 6 will (and should) other languages
steal?</strong></p>

<p>Perl has long been a leader in regexes, and in many senses <a
href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S05.html">Perl 6 grammars and its new regex
syntax</a> are a game changer. Parsing problems that are beyond traditional
regexes are now often easily expressible.  Additionally, the changes in Perl 6
seriously try to address the cultural problems; good software development
practices, such as code re-use, should also apply to regexes, and
that&mdash;amongst other things&mdash;is now made easy.</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of design?</strong></p>

<p>The willingness to revisit things when an implementation points out issues,
and an overriding commitment to get it right, rather than just get it out the
door in whatever shape as soon as possible. While it is somewhat frustrating
for those waiting to use Perl 6 in production, and to some degree for those of
us implementing it too when things get re-hashed, I'm also convinced that the
Perl 6 we deliver will be better for the time that's been taken over it.</p>

<p><strong>How did you learn the language?</strong></p>

<p>By implementing a chunk of it. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Where does an interested novice start to learn the language?</strong></p>

<p>Drop along to <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a> for links to the
latest and greatest in terms of documentation and tutorials. Some of us are
also working on a book (<a href="http://github.com/perl6/book/">Using Perl
6</a>). And of course, don't forget to join the #perl6 IRC channel. It's a
friendly place, and a great place to get questions answered.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make a language intended to last for 20
    years?</strong></p>

<p>While 20 years sounds a long time, in many senses if a language gets a
reasonable level of adoption&mdash;which I do hope Perl 6 will&mdash;it's easy
enough for legacy code to still be in production 20 years on.</p>

<p>The more interesting challenge is how to make a language that can stay at
the forefront for 20 years and still be considered modern. Since what's
considered modern will of course mutate, that means the language has to be able
to be designed with the ability to mutate too. Handling language mutations
sanely, and making sure it's always clear what "dialect" of Perl 6 is being
spoken, has been one of the big challenges in making Perl 6.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a feature or a technique "Perlish"?</strong></p>

<p>It makes an easy thing easy, or a hard thing possible. The amount of code is
proportional to the task at hand. It feels natural. It solves a real, practical
problem, so you can get your work done efficiently and have time to go for a
beer.</p>

<p><strong>What easy things are easier and which harder things are more
    possible now? Why?</strong></p>

<p>I'd say writing OO code is decidedly easier now, particularly for those
coming from other non-Perl language backgrounds. At the same time, so is
writing functional code. And writing clean code is most certainly easier.
Language extensions are an example of a harder thing that is made much more
possible in Perl 6; introducing a new operator isn't that much harder than
writing a subroutine, you just have to give it an interesting looking name.</p>

<p><strong>What feature are you most awaiting before you use Perl 6 for your
own serious projects?</strong></p>

<p>In a slightly odd sense, I am using Perl 6 for a serious project; big chunks
of Rakudo are actually written in Perl 6. That aside, though, feature wise I
think Rakudo is doing pretty well; the things I'm most waiting on&mdash;and
helping us improve on&mdash;are issues like performance, stability and having a
good range of modules to draw on. If I had to identify the next big features we
need, though, it's concurrency support and native type support.</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of development?</strong></p>

<p>The high standards at which it is conducted. For example, we have a lot of
effort going in to testing, and test coverage is taken seriously and highly
valued by all all of those working on Rakudo. People often code-review each
other's patches. Discussion on the channel and on the mailing lists&mdash;even
in the face of opposing views&mdash;is just about always polite and friendly.
The Perl 6 team is easily the best I've ever had the privilege to work
with.</p>

<p><strong>What does Rakudo need for wider deployment?</strong></p>

<p>Wider deployment means growing the users base. People should choose a
technology primarily on the merits of the technology itself. Therefore, to grow
a user base, Rakudo needs to deliver not only the benefits of the Perl 6
language itself, but also a stable and performant implementation of it. It's a
wider issue than Rakudo, but we also need lots of good modules and, perhaps,
some kind of killer app. Those kinds of things will come from the community at
large rather than just the core Rakudo team, however they matter significantly
to Rakudo's own success.</p>

<p><strong>What comes next after Rakudo Star?</strong></p>

<p>I often talk about Rakudo development as being like going for a hike up a
mountain. While the most impressive view will be at that top&mdash;when we have
a complete Perl 6 implementation&mdash;at some points along the way there will
be good views, and it's good to pause and enjoy them. Rakudo is one of those
points on the journey&mdash;in fact, the most significant so far.</p>

<p>Rakudo has caused us to focus for a while on trying to get something useful
and usable. That has been valuable, however there are still some big items to
take care of on the way to the mountain peak. Those will once again take center
stage after Rakudo *.</p>

<p>Two big areas of focus will be on native type handling and parallelism.
Part of the native type handling will involve a re-visit of how objects look
internally. Part of this is being able to store native types in them, not just
other objects. Additionally, we can actually do the vast majority of object
attribute lookups as index offsets instead of hash lookups, which should be a
big performance win. Lexical variable access can also be optimized in a similar
fashion. We have a lot of statically known information about a Perl 6 program
that we pretty much just throw away today.</p>

<p>We will also be transforming Rakudo from a compiler with one
backend&mdash;Parrot&mdash;into a compiler with multiple backends. We've had an
architecture open to such things for some time now, but getting the core
features in place and actually delivering something of note have been far more
important goals so far.</p>

<p>However, at this point, I think some things&mdash;especially parallelism, an
area where Parrot is currently weak&mdash;will be much easier to do an initial
implementation of for another backend. It usually takes at least a first cut
implementation and some iteration to get the specification solidified and
refined, and it will be easier to do that on a base that offers solid
concurrency primitives. I also hope that having other backends will help us
grow both the user base and the developer base.</p>

<p><strong>What feature do you most look forward to in a future version of Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to having good threading and parallel programming
support&mdash;but perhaps that's mostly because we'll be done with the hard
work of making it happen!</p>

<p><strong>Larry wanted the community to rewrite itself just as it redesigned
    and implemented the language.  How have you seen that process
    work?</strong></p>

<p>The state of the Perl 6 community today is something that is dear to many of
us who are a part of it. People frequently comment how the #perl6 IRC channel
is somehow different to the norm; it's very open to newcomers and beginners,
and people tend to have a very slow burning fuse. The challenge, of course, is
scaling that community without losing all of the nice things about it.
Significantly, the key players all really want to work out how to do that.</p>

<p><strong>How do you keep up with spec changes?</strong></p>

<p>Mostly through a very regular presence on #perl6, where a lot of them are
thrashed out. I also read the spec change commits as they are reported on the
perl6-language list.</p>

<p><strong>What one thing would you change about the implementation history so
    far?</strong></p>

<p>Implementation having been started sooner. Implementations have been the
primary driver towards the spec converging on something implementable and sane.
That said, the pre-implementation, tossing-about-ideas phase was, of course,
important.</p>

<p><strong>How can people help you?</strong></p>

<p>There's so much that needs doing in the Perl 6 world today! Generally, I
just advise interested people to take a look around, spot something interesting
to help with or something that's missing that they would like to work on, and
dig in! Perl 6 is very much about <a
    href="http://www.slideshare.net/autang/ofun-optimizing-for-fun">-Ofun</a>.
For some of us, fun is compiler guts. For others, fun is web frameworks. For
others, fun is making awesome documentation. If you want to help, find what's
fun for you, do it well, and make your mark on the evolving Perl 6
community.</p>

<p><strong>What misconceptions do people have about the project that need
    addressing?</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest one is that some people equate "taking a long time" with
"not going to happen". It's an easy enough misconception to form given the
project's long time scale, especially for anyone not really following the
day-to-day progress. Of course, it's a hard misconception to understand for
those who are following it too. :-)</p>

<p><strong>What projects are missing in the world of Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, there's thousands of modules to be written for all kinds of needs
from popular to niche. One area that certainly needs more effort, however, is
documentation. It's not like there aren't projects started, more just too few
hands for the amount of work that needs to be done.</p>
