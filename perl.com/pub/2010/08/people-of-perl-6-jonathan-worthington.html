<p><strong>What's your background?</strong></p>

<p>I discovered programming when I was about eight years old, and got hooked.
It started out with Logo and BBC Micro BASIC on some computers at school.
Several years and a couple of PC-based dialects of Basic later, my family got
internet access at home, and a couple of years later I ran across Perl.</p>

<p>I ended up going off to university to do Computer Science. I questioned it a
bit&mdash;I wasn't certain my childhood hobby would still be interesting as a
topic of study and a future career. Happily, it deepened my curiosity rather
than bored me. I took a particular interest in languages, compilers and type
systems, though the natural language processing courses kind of caught my
interest too.</p>

<p>That all came to an end several years back, when I graduated. Since then,
I've done a few years freelancing and living abroad, and recently joined a
startup company in Sweden. Amusingly, it makes the third country starting with
an "S" that I've lived in since graduating&mdash;the other two were sunny Spain
and the lesser-known but lovely Slovakia, a place I remain very fond of.</p>

<p><strong>What's your primary interest in Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>At the moment, I'm primarily interested in writing a good compiler for it.
Beyond that, I'd like to use it to build more cool things, though I've little
idea what yet. We'll see what comes along.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start contributing to Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2003, a couple of years after discovering Perl, I heard about Perl
6. I found the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">apocalypses</a>
engaging, and joined a couple of mailing lists. A lot of perl6-language
bewildered me. Well, some things never change. :-) I felt way out of my depth
on the language design front back then, but then found the <a
href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> project, which was a little more
concrete. I wrote a couple of patches to improve Windows support.</p>

<p>I did more bits with Parrot over the following years&mdash;mostly on the
bytecode format and some object orientation bits. I didn't really get involved
with the Perl 6 compiler itself until 2007. That summer, I went to OSCON, drank
a few beers and then told Larry Wall, of all people, that implementing
junctions in the Perl 6 on Parrot compiler sounded interesting.</p>

<p>Sadly, autumn of 2007 saw me pretty depressed. I withdrew from hacking on
just about everything, went to wander around China for a month and hurriedly
arranged to move abroad, in hope of putting some distance between myself and
things. With the Spanish sun to improve my mood, and noticing that the latest
iteration of the Perl 6 compiler&mdash;built on the <a
href="http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/PCT_Tutorial.html">Parrot
Compiler Toolkit</a>&mdash;had landed, it felt like time to try and make good
on my junctions remark.</p>

<p><strong>What have you worked on?</strong></p>

<p>Well, not long after digging in to junctions, I discovered that doing
junctions properly meant doing multiple dispatch... and doing multiple dispatch
meant doing a bunch of the type system stuff... and doing that meant being able
to declare classes and roles. A couple of years of hacking later, and with
plenty of input and help from others, we're doing pretty well on all of those
areas now in Rakudo. :-)</p>

<p><strong>What feature was your moment of epiphany with Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>That's a hard one. There are many interesting features in Perl 6&mdash;some
of them big things, some of them much smaller. What I've really come to admire
isn't so much the features themselves, but rather the much smaller number of
fundamentals that they're all built on top of, and how they them form a
coherent whole that is greater than its parts.</p>

<p><strong>What feature of Perl 6 will (and should) other languages
steal?</strong></p>

<p>Perl has long been a leader in regexes, and in many senses <a
href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S05.html">Perl 6 grammars and its new regex
syntax</a> are a game changer. Parsing problems that are beyond traditional
regexes are now often easily expressible.  Additionally, the changes in Perl 6
seriously try to address the cultural problems; good software development
practices, such as code re-use, should also apply to regexes, and
that&mdash;amongst other things&mdash;is now made easy.</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of design?</strong></p>

<p>The willingness to revisit things when an implementation points out issues,
and an overriding commitment to get it right, rather than just get it out the
door in whatever shape as soon as possible. While it is somewhat frustrating
for those waiting to use Perl 6 in production, and to some degree for those of
us implementing it too when things get re-hashed, I'm also convinced that the
Perl 6 we deliver will be better for the time that's been taken over it.</p>

<p><strong>How did you learn the language?</strong></p>

<p>By implementing a chunk of it. :-)</p>

<p><strong>Where does an interested novice start to learn the language?</strong></p>

<p>Drop along to <a href="http://perl6.org/">perl6.org</a> for links to the
latest and greatest in terms of documentation and tutorials. Some of us are
also working on a book (<a href="http://github.com/perl6/book/">Using Perl
6</a>). And of course, don't forget to join the #perl6 IRC channel. It's a
friendly place, and a great place to get questions answered.</p>

<p><strong>How do you make a language intended to last for 20
    years?</strong></p>

<p>While 20 years sounds a long time, in many senses if a language gets a
reasonable level of adoption&mdash;which I do hope Perl 6 will&mdash;it's easy
enough for legacy code to still be in production 20 years on.</p>

<p>The more interesting challenge is how to make a language that can stay at
the forefront for 20 years and still be considered modern. Since what's
considered modern will of course mutate, that means the language has to be able
to be designed with the ability to mutate too. Handling language mutations
sanely, and making sure it's always clear what "dialect" of Perl 6 is being
spoken, has been one of the big challenges in making Perl 6.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a feature or a technique "Perlish"?</strong></p>

<p>It makes an easy thing easy, or a hard thing possible. The amount of code is
proportional to the task at hand. It feels natural. It solves a real, practical
problem, so you can get your work done efficiently and have time to go for a
beer.</p>

<p><strong>What easy things are easier and which harder things are more
    possible now? Why?</strong></p>

<p>I'd say writing OO code is decidedly easier now, particularly for those
coming from other non-Perl language backgrounds. At the same time, so is
writing functional code. And writing clean code is most certainly easier.
Language extensions are an example of a harder thing that is made much more
possible in Perl 6; introducing a new operator isn't that much harder than
writing a subroutine, you just have to give it an interesting looking name.</p>

<p><strong>What feature are you most awaiting before you use Perl 6 for your
own serious projects?</strong></p>

<p>In a slightly odd sense, I am using Perl 6 for a serious project; big chunks
of Rakudo are actually written in Perl 6. That aside, though, feature wise I
think Rakudo is doing pretty well; the things I'm most waiting on&mdash;and
helping us improve on&mdash;are issues like performance, stability and having a
good range of modules to draw on. If I had to identify the next big features we
need, though, it's concurrency support and native type support.</p>

<p><strong>What has surprised you about the process of development?</strong></p>

<p>The high standards at which it is conducted. For example, we have a lot of
effort going in to testing, and test coverage is taken seriously and highly
valued by all all of those working on Rakudo. People often code-review each
other's patches. Discussion on the channel and on the mailing lists&mdash;even
in the face of opposing views&mdash;is just about always polite and friendly.
The Perl 6 team is easily the best I've ever had the privilege to work
with.</p>

<p><strong>What does Rakudo need for wider deployment?</strong></p>

<p>Wider deployment means growing the users base. People should choose a
technology primarily on the merits of the technology itself. Therefore, to grow
a user base, Rakudo needs to deliver not only the benefits of the Perl 6
language itself, but also a stable and performant implementation of it. It's a
wider issue than Rakudo, but we also need lots of good modules and, perhaps,
some kind of killer app. Those kinds of things will come from the community at
large rather than just the core Rakudo team, however they matter significantly
to Rakudo's own success.</p>

<p><strong>What comes next after Rakudo Star?</strong></p>

<p>I often talk about Rakudo development as being like going for a hike up a
mountain. While the most impressive view will be at that top&mdash;when we have
a complete Perl 6 implementation&mdash;at some points along the way there will
be good views, and it's good to pause and enjoy them. Rakudo is one of those
points on the journey&mdash;in fact, the most significant so far.</p>

<p>Rakudo has caused us to focus for a while on trying to get something useful
and usable. That has been valuable, however there are still some big items to
take care of on the way to the mountain peak. Those will once again take center
stage after Rakudo *.</p>

<p>Two big areas of focus will be on native type handling and parallelism.
Part of the native type handling will involve a re-visit of how objects look
internally. Part of this is being able to store native types in them, not just
other objects. Additionally, we can actually do the vast majority of object
attribute lookups as index offsets instead of hash lookups, which should be a
big performance win. Lexical variable access can also be optimized in a similar
fashion. We have a lot of statically known information about a Perl 6 program
that we pretty much just throw away today.</p>

<p>We will also be transforming Rakudo from a compiler with one
backend&mdash;Parrot&mdash;into a compiler with multiple backends. We've had an
architecture open to such things for some time now, but getting the core
features in place and actually delivering something of note have been far more
important goals so far.</p>

<p>However, at this point, I think some things&mdash;especially parallelism, an
area where Parrot is currently weak&mdash;will be much easier to do an initial
implementation of for another backend. It usually takes at least a first cut
implementation and some iteration to get the specification solidified and
refined, and it will be easier to do that on a base that offers solid
concurrency primitives. I also hope that having other backends will help us
grow both the user base and the developer base.</p>

<p><strong>What feature do you most look forward to in a future version of Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to having good threading and parallel programming
support&mdash;but perhaps that's mostly because we'll be done with the hard
work of making it happen!</p>

<p><strong>Larry wanted the community to rewrite itself just as it redesigned
    and implemented the language.  How have you seen that process
    work?</strong></p>

<p>The state of the Perl 6 community today is something that is dear to many of
us who are a part of it. People frequently comment how the #perl6 IRC channel
is somehow different to the norm; it's very open to newcomers and beginners,
and people tend to have a very slow burning fuse. The challenge, of course, is
scaling that community without losing all of the nice things about it.
Significantly, the key players all really want to work out how to do that.</p>

<p><strong>How do you keep up with spec changes?</strong></p>

<p>Mostly through a very regular presence on #perl6, where a lot of them are
thrashed out. I also read the spec change commits as they are reported on the
perl6-language list.</p>

<p><strong>What one thing would you change about the implementation history so
    far?</strong></p>

<p>Implementation having been started sooner. Implementations have been the
primary driver towards the spec converging on something implementable and sane.
That said, the pre-implementation, tossing-about-ideas phase was, of course,
important.</p>

<p><strong>How can people help you?</strong></p>

<p>There's so much that needs doing in the Perl 6 world today! Generally, I
just advise interested people to take a look around, spot something interesting
to help with or something that's missing that they would like to work on, and
dig in! Perl 6 is very much about <a
    href="http://www.slideshare.net/autang/ofun-optimizing-for-fun">-Ofun</a>.
For some of us, fun is compiler guts. For others, fun is web frameworks. For
others, fun is making awesome documentation. If you want to help, find what's
fun for you, do it well, and make your mark on the evolving Perl 6
community.</p>

<p><strong>What misconceptions do people have about the project that need
    addressing?</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest one is that some people equate "taking a long time" with
"not going to happen". It's an easy enough misconception to form given the
project's long time scale, especially for anyone not really following the
day-to-day progress. Of course, it's a hard misconception to understand for
those who are following it too. :-)</p>

<p><strong>What projects are missing in the world of Perl 6?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, there's thousands of modules to be written for all kinds of needs
from popular to niche. One area that certainly needs more effort, however, is
documentation. It's not like there aren't projects started, more just too few
hands for the amount of work that needs to be done.</p>
