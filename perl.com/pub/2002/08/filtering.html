<p>There are many ways to filter your e-mail with Perl. Two of the
more popular and interesting ways are to use <code>PerlMx</code> or <code>Mail::Audit</code>.
I took a long look at both, and this is what I thought of them.</p>

<h3><a name="perlmx"><code>PerlMx</code></a></h3>

<p><code>PerlMx</code> is a server product from ActiveState that uses the milter
support in recent versions of sendmail to hook in at almost every
stage of the mail-handling process.</p>

<p><code>PerlMx</code> comes with its own copy of Perl, and all the supporting modules
it needs - it can't run from a normal Perl, as it needs Perl to be
built with various options such as ithreads support and multiplicity.
This means you need to install any modules you want to use with <code>PerlMx</code>
twice if you already have them installed somewhere else on your system.</p>

<p><code>PerlMx</code> provides a persistent daemon that processes e-mail for an
entire mail-server - it avoids the overhead of starting a Perl
process to handle each e-mail by running forever, and by using threads
to ensure it can service more than one e-mail at a time.</p>



<p><code>PerlMx</code> ships with two main filters - the Spam and Virus filters. The
Virus filtering looks interesting, but ultimately I don't receive that
many viruses in e-mail, so I was unable to test it beyond establishing
that it didn't mangle my e-mail.</p>

<p> The Spam filtering in PerlMX is much more interesting - it seems to
be based on <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">Mail::SpamAssassin</a>, a popular
spam filtering module often used with Mail::Audit, procmail, or other
ways of processing e-mail.</p><p>In two weeks of testing with <code>PerlMx</code>, using it to process a copy of
all my personal e-mail, I found a lot useful functionality, and a
few minor problems.</p>

<p>The first hassles were setup - I don't normally use sendmail, but 
<code>PerlMx</code> requires it for the milter API, so I installed sendmail, set
it up, and hooked it into <code>PerlMx</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have sendmail setup, and built with milter support (as
the default build from Debian Linux I used was), it's easy to add
a connection to <code>PerlMx</code> with one line in your sendmail.mc file:</p>

<pre><code>
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`C&lt;PerlMx&gt;', `S=inet:3366@localhost, F=T, 
     T=S:3m;R:3m;E:8m'')</code></pre>

<p><code>PerlMx</code> essentially works out of the box - it asks a number of simple
questions when you install and set it up, and assuming you get these
right, no further configuration will be required.</p>

<p>The <code>INPUT_MAIL_FILTER</code> line also sets several key options, including
the timeouts for communication between sendmail and <code>PerlMx</code> - I had to
raise these significantly to deal with a problem I found where 
<code>PerlMx</code> was taking too much time to process spam (it appear to be doing
DNS lookups), sendmail was timing out the connection to <code>PerlMx</code>, and
refusing to accept mail.</p>

<p>In <code>PerlMx</code> 2.1, it even ships with its own sendmail install, pre-configured
for use with <code>PerlMx</code>, but you can choose to ignore this and use an
existing system sendmail.</p>

<p>Once you've done this, suddenly all the mail that goes through your
mail-server is spam filtered, and virus checked. Mail that looks
likely to be spam, or that contains a virus is stopped and held in a
quarantine queue, the rest are sent to the user, possibly with a spam
header added to indicate a score representing how likely to be spam
they are. The quarantine queue is a systemwide collection of messages
which, for one reason or another, weren't appropriate to deliver
to the user - this will be normally as they are either suspected to
contain viruses or spam.</p>

<p>If the filters supplied with <code>PerlMx</code> aren't to your tastes, then it comes
supplied with an extension API, and extensive documentation and samples
to allow you to write your own.</p>

<p>While testing <code>PerlMx</code>, I never managed to bounce or accidentally lose
my e-mail - I made many configuration errors, which meant mail wasn't
processed and a lot of stuff was somewhat over-enthusiastically marked
as spam when it was actually valid. But as far as I can tell, nothing
bounced or disappeared into the system - this is pretty impressive,
as when configuring most new bits of e-mail I usually manage to delete
everything I send to it in the first few attempts, or, worse, make
myself look stupid by sending errors back to random people unfortunate
enough to be on the same mailing list as me.</p>

<h3><a name="mail::audit"><code>Mail::Audit</code></a></h3>

<p><code>Mail::Audit</code> is very different from <code>PerlMx</code>. For starters, once you've 
installed it, by default it doesn't do anything.  <code>Mail::Audit</code> is
just a Perl module - it's a powerful tool for implementing mail
filters, but mostly you have to write them yourself. <code>PerlMx</code> ships
with spam filtering and virus checking configured by default, 
<code>Mail::Audit</code> provides duplicate killing, a mailing list processing
module (based on Mail::ListDetector), and a few simple spam
filtering options based on Realtime Blackhole Lists or Vipul's Razor.</p>

<p><code>Mail::Audit</code> is not designed to be used with an entire mail-server
in the same way as <code>PerlMx</code>. Instead, it allows you to easily write
little e-mail filter programs that can be triggered from the <em>.forward</em>
file of a particular user. <code>Mail::Audit</code> can be easily configured and
used on a per-user basis, whereas <code>PerlMx</code> takes over an entire mail-server
and is an all-or-nothing choice.</p>

<p>The default <code>Mail::Audit</code> configuration starts one Perl process for each
mail handled - normally this won't be a problem, but if you're
processing large volumes of mail, or have a system which is already at
or near capacity, it may be enough to tip the balance and cause
performance problems (Translation: Long ago I installed <code>Mail::Audit</code> on
an old, spare machine I was using as a mail-server, received 200 e-mails
in less than a minute, and spent quite a while waiting for the system to
stop gazing at its navel and start responding to the outside world
again). If your mail comes to you via POP3, or can be made to do so
(possibly by installing a POP3 daemon if you do not have one already),
then a simple script supplied with <code>Mail::Audit</code> called <em>popread</em> provides
a base you can use to feed articles from a POP3 server into
<code>Mail::Audit</code> in a single Perl process, improving performance. I didn't
do this myself, as I wanted to use what appeared to be the
'recommended' approach to <code>Mail::Audit</code> setup - the one that is, if not
actively promoted in the documentation, most strongly suggested by it,
of running a <code>Mail::Audit</code> script from a user's .forward file.</p>

<p>A popular <code>Mail::Audit</code> addition is SpamAssassin (the
same codebase as <code>PerlMx</code>'s mail processing is loosely based on) - this
comes as a <code>Mail::Audit</code> plugin, among other forms.</p>

<p><code>Mail::Audit</code> makes it easy to write mail filters that work on a
per-user basis, whereas <code>PerlMx</code> by default applies to all mail
processed on a given mailserver.</p>

<p>
If you wanted to install <code>Mail::Audit</code> systemwide, then many mail-servers
(such as exim) provide a way to configure a custom local delivery agent
on flexible criteria. For example,
<a href="http://bogmog.sourceforge.net/document_show.php3?doc_id=28">this
article</a> provides
some documentation on how to do this with exim.</p>
















<h3><a name="testing... 1... 2... 3...">Testing ... 1 ... 2 ... 3 ...</a></h3>

<p>I decided to do an extended comparison of both <code>PerlMx</code> and
<code>Mail::Audit</code>. As one of the most common applications of mail filtering
tools is for spam filtering, I set up recent versions of both the tools
on my personal e-mail, by various nefarious means, ran them for
a week, and compared the results on two main criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>
False positives (legitimate email recognized as spam)</li>

<li>
False negatives (spam not recognized as spam)</li>

</ul>
<p><code>Mail::Audit</code> doesn't come with much spam filtering technology by
default, so I decided to add SpamAssassin (http://www.spamassassin.org/)
to the testing, as it can be used as a <code>Mail::Audit</code> extension.</p>
<p>I used procmail to copy all my incoming e-mail to two pop3 mailboxes
setup for the purposes of testing - one would contain mail to be
processed by <code>Mail::Audit</code>, the other mail to be processed by
<code>PerlMx</code>'s spam filtering. fetchmail was used to pull the mail down
into the domain of <code>Mail::Audit</code> and <code>PerlMx</code>.</p>
<p>Once I had <code>Mail::Audit</code> and SpamAssassin setup, I started feeding mail
into the test box with fetchmail, and was reminded that as the <code>Mail::Audit</code>
approach of setting up a perl program to run from a .forward file
has ... unpleasant effects if you receive more than a few e-mails in
quick succession. As my test mail-server collapsed under the load,
I checked the <code>PerlMx</code> machine, started at roughly the same time, and found that
while it was working through the e-mail more slowly, it hadn't put
any serious load on the machine.</p>
<p>Due to a <code>PerlMx</code> configuration error on my part, of the first 171 messages
processed, 10 were quarantined as spam AND delivered to the inbox of
my test user. <code>PerlMx</code> runs by default in 'training mode' when processing
spam - in this mode, mail is spamchecked as normal, but even if it
is found to be spam and quarantined, it is also delivered to the
user.</p>
<p>I decided to keep track of any mail lost or mislaid during initial
setup problems, so I could see what problems could arise from the
tools being misconfigured. An important aspect of any software is not
only how it behaves when configured right, but how much it punishes
you when you get the configuration wrong.</p>
<p>Waking up the next morning, I found I'd bounced several hundred e-mails
back to the account from which I was forwarding all the test e-mails,
someone of which appeared to have gone back and forth, or found their
way into the <code>PerlMx</code> test mailbox. Most of the problems appeared to be
internal errors from within SpamAssassin. My mail-server still
hadn't recovered.</p>
<p>I later found this was because of an compatibility issue with
SpamAssassin / <code>Mail::Audit</code>, and there was a recommended fix in the
SpamAssassin FAQ involving the <em>nomime</em> option to <code>Mail::Audit</code> (but not,
sadly, in the documentation for the Mail::SpamAssassin module
itself).</p>
<p>The SpamAssassin / <code>Mail::Audit</code> script I ended up using in the end was:</p>
<pre><code>
  #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w</code></pre>
<pre><code>
  use strict;
  use C&lt;Mail::Audit&gt;;
  use Mail::SpamAssassin;</code></pre>
<pre><code>
  # create C&lt;Mail::Audit&gt; object, log to /tmp, disable mime processing
  # for SpamAssassin compatibility, and store mail in ~/emergency_mbox
  # if processing fails
  my $mail = C&lt;Mail::Audit&gt;-&gt;new(emergency=&gt;&quot;~/emergency_mbox&quot;,
                              log =&gt; '/tmp/audit.log',
                              loglevel =&gt; 4, nomime =&gt; 1);</code></pre>
<pre><code>
  my $spamtest = Mail::SpamAssassin-&gt;new;
  
  # check mail with SpamAssassin
  my $status = $spamtest-&gt;check($mail);
  
  # if it was spam, rewrite to indicate what the problem was, and 
  # store in the file ass-spam in our home directory
  if ($status-&gt;is_spam) {
          $status-&gt;rewrite_mail;
          $mail-&gt;accept(&quot;/home/spam1/ass-spam&quot;);
  # if if wasn't spam, accept it as normal mail
  } else {
          $mail-&gt;accept;
  }
  
  exit 0;
</code></pre>

<p>After clearing down all my mail, and losing two days of testing, I
started again. It was only the nature of the testing setup that meant
the bounce mail went to me and not the original sender.  So, at 23:25
on Tuesday, I had another go. This time I knew enough to limit
SpamAssassin to receiving messages in batches of five (using fetchmail) -
something I could do in testing, but wouldn't be an easy option in
most production setups. This meant my test machine could just about
cope with delivering mail using SpamAssassin.</p>
<p>At 10 p.m. Sunday, I declared the testing closed, and examined the
accuracy or otherwise of each system.</p>
<p>During the testing between Aug. 6 and 11, <code>Mail::Audit</code>
marked 16 pieces of e-mail as spam. Seven of these e-mails proved to be
false positives - mail that I had actually solicited and would have
liked to have received. Six spam emails were accepted into my Inbox.
There were 874 e-mails received in all. <code>Mail::Audit</code> appeared to receive
15 pieces of spam mail in total.</p>
<p><code>PerlMx</code> marked 14 e-mails as spam. Two of these e-mails proved to be false
positives - mail that was not spam. Impressively, it received 886
e-mails in the same period that <code>Mail::Audit</code> received 874 e-mails. I
was unable to work out the exact cause of this, although the power-cut
in the middle of the testing period will always be a major suspect.
Eleven spam messages were incorrectly allowws through into my Inbox.
<code>PerlMx</code> appeared to receive 23 pieces of spam mail in total.</p>
<p>The sample was small, as all I had was my own personal e-mail to work
with, and I get what I'm told is surprisingly little spam, but it
shows that <code>Mail::Audit</code> / SpamAssassin seems to decide more mail is
spam than <code>PerlMx</code> does, but is also wrong more of the time. <code>PerlMx</code>
marked slightly less e-mail as spam, and let more spam through,
but when it did claim e-mail was spam it was right more of the time.</p>
<p>These tests would benefit significantly from being re-run during a long
period of time on a larger mail-server, but I had neither the time
nor the mail-server available.</p>
<p>Both tools can be extensively configured in terms of what is
considered spam, and are likely to need regular updating to ensure
they keep up to date with new tricks of the spammers. Here I only
considered the behavior with the default configuration of the latest
release at the time I ran my tests.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h3>

<p>During testing, <code>PerlMx</code> was significantly more reliable, both in terms
of the amount of mail bounced due to configuration problems (none),
and in terms of the load put in the mailserver (minimal) than
<code>Mail::Audit</code>. Although <code>Mail::Audit</code> appears able to be setup for good
performance, the obvious suggested configuration showed extremely poor
scalability during testing. Also, as <code>Mail::Audit</code> requires writing some
filtering code, bugs, mostly in this code, resulted in nontrivial
quantities of mail being bounced during testing due to
code/configuration errors, a problem that simply didn't occur with
<code>PerlMx</code>'s more pre-supplied, configuration file based system.</p>

<p>Both <code>PerlMx</code> and <code>Mail::Audit</code> provide good mail filtering solutions
using Perl, but are targeted at entirely different markets.  <code>PerlMx</code>
is a systemwide solution providing drop-in functionality on
mailservers, with Perl extensibility as well, whereas <code>Mail::Audit</code> is a
more low-level tool, mostly focused on use by individuals, designed to
let users build their own mail processing tools more easily.</p>
