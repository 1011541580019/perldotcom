<p>
<h3>A summary of the changes in Apocalypse 5:</h3>
<h3><a name="unchanged_features">Unchanged features</a></h3></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Capturing: (...)</li>

<li>
Repetition quantifiers: *, +, and ?</li>

<li>
Alternatives:  |</li>

<li>
Backslash escape:  \</li>

<li>
Minimal matching suffix:   ??,  *?,  +?
</li></ul></p>
<p>
</p>

<h3><a name="modifiers">Modifiers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The extended syntax (<code>/x</code>) is no longer required...it's the default.
</li><br />
<li>
There are no <code>/s</code> or <code>/m</code> modifiers (changes to the meta-characters replace them - see below).
</li><br />
<li>
There is no <code>/e</code> evaluation modifier on substitutions; 
use <code>s/pattern/$( code() )/</code> instead.
</li><br />
<li>
The <code>/g</code> modifier has been renamed to <code>e</code> (for <code>each</code>).
</li><br />
<li>
Modifiers are now placed as adverbs at the <em>start</em> of a match/substitution:
<pre>
    @matches = m:ei/\s* (\w*) \s* ,?/;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The single-character modifiers also have longer versions:
<pre>
        :i        :ignorecase
        :e        :each</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The <code>:c</code> (or <code>:cont</code>) modifier causes the match to continue from the string's current <code>.pos</code>:
<pre>
    m:c/ pattern /        # start at end of
                          # previous match on $_</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The new <code>:o</code> (<code>:once</code>) modifier replaces the Perl 5 <code>?...?</code> syntax:
<pre>
    m:once/ pattern /    # only matches first time</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The new <code>:w</code> (<code>:word</code>) modifier causes whitespace sequences to be replaced by <code>\s*</code> or <code>\s+</code> subpattern:
<pre>
    m:w/ next cmd =   &lt;condition&gt;/</pre>
</li><br />

<li>
Same as:
<pre>
    m/ \s* next \s+ cmd \s* = \s* &lt;condition&gt;/</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The new <code>:uN</code> modifier specifies Unicode level:
<pre>
    m:u0/ .&lt;2&gt; /        # match two bytes
    m:u1/ .&lt;2&gt; /        # match two codepoints
    m:u2/ .&lt;2&gt; /        # match two graphemes
    m:u3/ .&lt;2&gt; /        # match language dependently</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The new <code>:p5</code> modifier allows Perl 5 regex syntax to be used instead:
<pre>
    m:p5/(?mi)^[a-z]{1,2}(?=\s)/</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Any integer modifier specifies a count. What kind of count is determined by the character that follows.
</li><br />
<li>
If followed by an <code>x</code>, it means repetition:
<pre>
    s:4x{ (&lt;ident&gt;) = (\N+) $$}{$1 =&gt; $2};</pre>
<pre>
    # same as:</pre>
<pre>
    s{ (&lt;ident&gt;) = (\N+) $$}{$1 =&gt; $2} for 1..4;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
If followed by an <code>st</code>, <code>nd</code>, <code>rd</code>, or <code>th</code>, it means find the <em>N</em>th occurance:
<pre>
    s:3rd/(\d+)/@data[$1]/;</pre>
<pre>
    # same as:</pre>
<pre>
    m/(\d+)/ &amp;&amp; m:c/(\d+)/ &amp;&amp; s:c/(\d+)/@data[$1]/;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
With the new <code>:any</code> modifier, the regex will match every possible way (including overlapping) and return all matches.
<pre>
    $str = &quot;abracadabra&quot;;</pre>
<pre>
    @substrings = $str =~ m:any/ a (.*) a /;</pre>
<pre>
    # br brac bracad bracadabr c cad cadabr d dabr br</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The <code>:i</code>, <code>:w</code>, <code>:c</code>, <code>:uN</code>, and <code>:p5</code> modifiers can be placed inside the regex (and are lexically scoped):
<pre>
    m/:c alignment = [:i left|right|cent[er|re]] /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
User-defined modifiers will be possible
<pre>
        m:fuzzy/pattern/;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Single letter flags can be ``chained'':
<pre>
        s:ewi/cat/feline/</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
User-defined modifiers can also take arguments:
<pre>
        m:fuzzy('bare')/pattern/;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Hence parentheses are no longer valid regex delimiters
</li><br /></ul>

<h3><a name="changed_metacharacters">Changed metacharacters</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
A dot <code>.</code> now matches <em>any</em> character including newline. (The <code>/s</code> modifier is gone.)
</li><br />
<li>
<code>^</code> and <code>$</code> now always match the start/end of a string, like the old <code>\A</code> and <code>\z</code>. (The <code>/m</code> modifier is gone.)
</li><br />
<li>
A <code>$</code> no longer matches an optional preceding <code>\n</code> so it's necessary to say <code>\n?$</code> if that's what you mean.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\n</code> now matches a logical (platform independent) newline not just <code>\012</code>.
</li><br />
<li>
The <code>\A</code>, <code>\Z</code>, and <code>\z</code> metacharacters are gone.
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="new_metacharacters">New metacharacters</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Because <code>/x</code> is default:
<ul>
<li>
<code>#</code> now always introduces a comment.
</li><br />
<li>
Whitespace is now always metasyntactic, i.e. used only for layout and not matched literally (but see the :w modifier described above).
</li><br /></ul>
<li>
<code>^^</code> and <code>$$</code> match line beginnings and endings. (The <code>/m</code> modifier is gone.)
</li><br />
<li>
<code>.</code> matches an ``anything'', while <code>\N</code> matches an ``anything except newline''. (The <code>/s</code> modifier is gone.)
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="bracket_rationalization">Bracket rationalization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<code>(...)</code> still delimits a capturing group.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>[...]</code> is no longer a character class.
</li><br />

<li>
It now delimits a non-capturing group.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>{...}</code> is no longer a repetition quantifier.
</li><br />
<li>
It now delimits an embedded closure.
</li><br />
<li>
You can call Perl code as part of a regex match.
</li><br />
<li>
Embedded code does not usually affect the match - it is only used for side-effects:
<pre>
    / (\S+) { print &quot;string not blank\n&quot;; $text = $1; }
       \s+  { print &quot;but does contain whitespace\n&quot; }
    /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
It can affect the match if it calls <code>fail</code>:
<pre>
    / (\d+) {$1&lt;256 or fail} /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
<code>&lt;...&gt;</code> are now extensible metasyntax delimiters or ``assertions'' (i.e. they replace <code>(?...)</code>).
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="variable_(non)interpolation">Variable (non-)interpolation</a></h3>



<ul>
<li>
In Perl 6 regexes, variables don't interpolate.
</li><br />
<li>
Instead they're passed ``raw'' to the regex engine, which can then decide how to handle them (more on that below).
</li><br />
<li>
The default way in which the engine handles a scalar is to match it as a \Q[...] literal (i.e.it does not treat the interpolated string as a subpattern).
</li><br />
<li>
In other words, a Perl 6:    / $var /
<p>is like a Perl 5:            / \Q$var\E /</p>
</li><br />
<li>
(To get regex interpolation use an assertion - see below)
</li><br />
<li>
An interpolated array:
<pre>
    / @cmds /</pre>
<p>is matched as if it were an alternation of its elements:</p>
<pre>
    / [ @cmds[0] | @cmds[1] | @cmds[2] | ... ] /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
And, of course, each one is matched as a literal.
</li><br />
<li>
An interpolated hash matches a <code>/\w+/</code> and then requires that sequence to be a valid key of the hash.
</li><br />
<li>
So:
<pre>
    / %cmds /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
is like:
<pre>
    / (\w+) { fail unless exists %cmds{$1} } /</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="extensible_metasyntax_(<...>)">Extensible metasyntax (<code>&lt;...&gt;</code>)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The first character after <code>&lt;</code> determines the behaviour of the assertion.
</li><br />
<li>
A leading alphabetic character means it's a grammatical assertion (i.e. a subpattern or a named character class - see below):
<pre>
    / &lt;sign&gt;? &lt;mantissa&gt; &lt;exponent&gt;? /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The special named assertions include:
<pre>
    / &lt;before pattern&gt; /    # was /(?=pattern)/
    / &lt;after pattern&gt; /     # was /(?&lt;pattern)/ 
                            # but now a real pattern!</pre>
<pre>
    / &lt;ws&gt; /                # match any whitespace</pre>
<pre>
    / &lt;sp&gt; /                # match a space char</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading number, pair of numbers, or pair of scalars means it's a repetition specifier:
<pre>
    / value was (\d&lt;1,6&gt;) with (\w&lt;$m,$n&gt;) /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>$</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>%</code>, or <code>&amp;</code> interpolates a variable or subroutine return value as a regex rather than as a literal:
<pre>
    / &lt;$key_pat&gt; = &lt;@value_alternatives&gt; /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>(</code> indicates a code assertion:
<pre>
    / (\d&lt;1,3&gt;) &lt;( $1 &lt; 256 )&gt; /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Same as:
<pre>
    / (\d&lt;1,3&gt;) {$1&lt;256 or fail} /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>{</code> indicates code that produces a regex to be interpolated into the pattern at that point:
<pre>
    / (&lt;ident&gt;)  &lt;{ cache{$1} //= get_body($1) }&gt; /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>[</code> indicates an enumerated character class:
<pre>
    / &lt;[a-z_]&gt;* /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>-</code> indicates a complemented character class:
<pre>
    / &lt;-[a-z_]&gt; &lt;-&lt;alpha&gt;&gt; /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>'</code> indicates an interpolated literal match (including whitespace):
<pre>
    / &lt;'match this exactly (whitespace matters)'&gt; /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The special assertion <code>&lt;.&gt;</code> matches any logical grapheme (including a Unicode combining character sequences):
<pre>
    / seekto = &lt;.&gt; /  # Maybe a combined char</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
A leading <code>!</code> indicates a negated meaning (a zero-width assertion except for repetition specifiers):
<pre>
    / &lt;!before _&gt;    # We aren't before an _
      \w&lt;!1,3&gt;       # We match 0 or &gt;3 word chars
    /</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>













<p><em>Editor's note: this document is out of date and remains here for historic interest.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 5</a> for the current design information.</p>

<h3><a name="backslash_reform">Backslash reform</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The <code>\p</code> and <code>\P</code> properties become intrinsic grammar rules (<code>&lt;prop ...&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;!prop ...&gt;</code>).
</li><br />
<li>
The <code>\L...\E</code>, <code>\U...\E</code>, and <code>\Q...\E</code> sequences become <code>\L[...]</code>, <code>\U[...]</code>, and <code>\Q[...]</code> (<code>\E</code> is gone).
</li><br />
<li>
Note that <code>\Q[...]</code> will rarely be needed since raw variables interpolate as <code>eq</code> matches, rather than regexes.
</li><br />
<li>
Backreferences (e.g. <code>\1</code>) are gone; <code>$1</code> can be used instead, because it's no longer interpolated.
</li><br />
<li>
New backslash sequences, <code>\h</code> and <code>\v</code>, match horizontal and vertical whitespace respectively, including Unicode.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\s</code> now matches any Unicode whitespace character.
</li><br />
<li>
The new backslash sequence <code>\N</code> matches anything except a logical newline; it is the negation of <code>\n</code>.
</li><br />
<li>
A series of other new capital backslash sequences are also the negation of their lower-case counterparts:
<ul>
<li>
<code>\H</code> matches anything but horizontal whitespace.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\V</code> matches anything but vertical whitespace.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\T</code> matches anything but a tab.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\R</code> matches anything but a return.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\F</code> matches anything but a formfeed.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\E</code> matches anything but an escape.
</li><br />
<li>
<code>\X...</code> matches anything but the specified hex character.
</li><br /></ul>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="regexes_are_rules">Regexes are rules</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The Perl 5  <code>qr/pattern/</code> regex constructor is gone.
</li><br />
<li>
The Perl 6 equivalents are:
<pre>
    rule { pattern }    # always takes {...} as delimiters
    rx/ pattern /       # can take (almost any) chars as delimiters</pre>
</li><br />



<li>
If either needs modifiers, they go before the opening delimiter:
<pre>
    $regex = rule :ewi { my name is (.*) };
    $regex = rx:ewi/ my name is (.*) /;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The name of the constructor was changed from <code>qr</code> because it's no longer an interpolating quote-like operator.
</li><br />
<li>
As the syntax indicates, it is now more closely analogous to a <code>sub {...}</code> constructor.
</li><br />
<li>
In fact, that analogy will run <em>very</em> deep in Perl 6.
</li><br />
<li>
Just as a raw <code>{...}</code> is now always a closure (which may still execute immediately in certain contexts and be passed as a reference in others)...
</li><br />
<li>
...so too a raw <code>/.../</code> is now always a regex (which may still match immediately in certain contexts and be passed as a reference in others).
</li><br />
<li>
Specifically, a <code>/.../</code> matches immediately in a void or Boolean context, or when it is an explicit argument of a <code>=~</code>.
</li><br />
<li>
Otherwise it's a regex constructor.
</li><br />
<li>
So this:
<pre>
    $var = /pattern/;</pre>
<p>no longer does the match and sets <code>$var</code> to the result.</p>
</li><br />
<li>
Instead it assigns a regex reference to <code>$var</code>.
</li><br />
<li>
The two cases can always be distinguished using <code>m{...}</code> or <code>rx{...}</code>:
<pre>
    $var = m{pattern};    # Match regex, assign result
    $var = rx{pattern};   # Assign regex itself</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Note that this means that former magically lazy usages like:
<pre>
    @list = split /pattern/, $str;</pre>
<p>are now just consequences of the normal semantics.</p>
</li><br />
<li>
It's now also possible to set up a user-defined subroutine that acts like grep:
<pre>
    sub my_grep($selector, *@list) {
        given $selector {
            when RULE  { ... }
            when CODE  { ... }
            when HASH  { ... }
            # etc.
        }
    }</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Using <code>{...}</code> or <code>/.../</code> in the scalar context of the first argument causes it to produce a <code>CODE</code> or <code>RULE</code> reference, which the switch statement then selects upon.
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="backtracking_control">Backtracking control</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Backtracking over a single colon causes the regex engine not to retry the preceding atom:
<pre>
    m:w/ \( &lt;expr&gt; [ , &lt;expr&gt; ]* : \) /</pre>
<p>(i.e. there's no point trying fewer <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> matches, if there's no closing parenthesis on the horizon)</p>
</li><br />
<li>
Backtracking over a double colon causes the surrounding group to immediately fail:
<pre>
    m:w/ [ if :: &lt;expr&gt; &lt;block&gt;
         | for :: &lt;list&gt; &lt;block&gt;
         | loop :: &lt;loop_controls&gt;? &lt;block&gt;
         ]
    /</pre>
<p>(i.e. there's no point trying to match a different keyword if one was already found but failed)</p>
</li><br />
<li>
Backtracking over a triple colon causes the current rule to fail outright (no matter where in the rule it occurs):
<pre>
    rule ident {
          ( [&lt;alpha&gt;|_] \w* ) ::: { fail if %reserved{$1} }
        | &quot; [&lt;alpha&gt;|_] \w* &quot;
    }</pre>
<pre>
    m:w/ get &lt;ident&gt;? /</pre>
<p>(i.e. using an unquoted reserved word as an identifier is not permitted)</p>
</li><br />
<li>
Backtracking over a <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> assertion causes the entire match to fail outright, no matter how many subrules down it happens:
<pre>
    rule subname {
        ([&lt;alpha&gt;|_] \w*) &lt;commit&gt; { fail if %reserved{$1} }
    }
    m:w/ sub &lt;subname&gt;? &lt;block&gt; /</pre>
<p>(i.e. using a reserved word as a subroutine name is instantly fatal to the ``surrounding'' match as well)</p>
</li><br />
<li>
A &lt;cut&gt; assertion always matches successfully, and has the side effect of deleting the parts of the string already matched.
</li><br />
<li>
Attempting to backtrack past a &lt;cut&gt; causes the complete match to fail (like backtracking past a &lt;commit&gt;. This is because there's now no preceding text to backtrack into.
</li><br />
<li>
This is useful for throwing away successfully processed input when matching from an input stream or an iterator of arbitrary length.

<h3><a name="named_regexes">Named Regexes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The analogy between <code>sub</code> and <code>rule</code> extends much further.
</li><br />
<li>
Just as you can have anonymous subs and named subs...
</li><br />
<li>
...so too you can have anonymous regexes and <em>named</em> regexes:
<pre>
    rule ident { [&lt;alpha&gt;|_] \w* }</pre>
<pre>
    # and later...</pre>
<pre>
    @ids = grep /&lt;ident&gt;/, @strings;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
As the above example indicates, it's possible to refer to named regexes, such as:
<pre>
    rule serial_number { &lt;[A-Z]&gt; \d&lt;8&gt; })
    rule type { alpha | beta | production | deprecated | legacy }</pre>
<p>in other regexes as named assertions:</p>
<pre>
    rule identification { [soft|hard]ware &lt;type&gt; &lt;serial_number&gt; }</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="nothing_is_illegal">Nothing is illegal</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The null pattern is now illegal.
</li><br />
<li>
To match whatever the prior successful regex matched, use:
<pre>
    /&lt;prior&gt;/</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
To match the zero-width string, use:
<pre>
    /&lt;null&gt;/</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="hypothetical_variables">Hypothetical variables</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
In embedded closures it's possible to bind a variable to a value that only ``sticks'' if the surrounding pattern successfully matches.
</li><br />
<li>
A variable is declared with the keyword <code>let</code> and then bound to the desired value:
<pre>
    / (\d+) {let $num := $1} (&lt;alpha&gt;+)/</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Now <code>$num</code> will only be bound if the digits are actually found.
</li><br />
<li>
If the match ever backtracks past the closure (i.e. if there are no alphabetics following), the binding is ``undone''.
</li><br />
<li>
This is even more interesting in alternations:
<pre>
    / [ (\d+)      { let $num   := $1 }
      | (&lt;alpha&gt;+) { let $alpha := $2 }
      | (.)        { let $other := $3 }
      ]
    /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
There is also a shorthand for assignment to hypothetical variables:
<pre>
    / [ $num  := (\d+)
      | $alpha:= (&lt;alpha&gt;+)
      | $other:=(.)
      ]
    /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
The numeric variables (<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc.) are also ``hypothetical''.
</li><br />
<li>
Numeric variables can be assigned to, and even re-ordered:
<pre>
    my ($key, $val) = m:w{ $1:=(\w+) =\&gt; $2:=(.*?)
                         | $2:=(.*?) \&lt;= $1:=(\w+)
                         };</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Repeated captures can be bound to arrays:
<pre>
    / @values:=[ (.*?) , ]* /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Pairs of repeated captures can be bound to hashes:
<pre>
    / %options:=[ (&lt;ident&gt;) = (\N+) ]* /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Or just capture the keys (and leave the values undef):
<pre>
    / %options:=[ (&lt;ident&gt;) = \N+ ]* /</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Subrules (e.g. <code>&lt;rule&gt;</code>) also capture their result in a hypothetical variable of the same name as the rule:
<pre>
    / &lt;key&gt; =\&gt; &lt;value&gt; { %hash{$key} = $value } /</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="return_values_from_matches">Return values from matches</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
A match always returns a ``match object'', which is also available as (lexical) <code>$0</code>
</li><br />
<li>
The match object evaluates differently in different contexts:
<ul>
<li>
in boolean context it evaluates as true or false (i.e. did the match succeed?):
<pre>
    if /pattern/ {...}
    # or:
    /pattern/; if $0 {...}</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
in numeric context it evaluates to the number of matches:
<pre>
    $match_count += m:e/pattern/;</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
in string context it evaluates to the captured substring (if there was exactly one capture in the pattern) or to the entire text that was matched (if the pattern does not capture, or captures multiple elements):
<pre>
    print %hash{$text =~ /,? (&lt;ident&gt;)/};
    # or: 
    $text =~ /,? (&lt;ident&gt;)/  &amp;&amp;  print %hash{$0};</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<li>
<em>Within</em> a regex, <code>$0</code> acts like a hypothetical variable.
</li><br />
<li>
It controls what a regex match returns (like <code>$$</code> does in yacc)
</li><br />
<li>
Use <code>$0:=</code> to override the default return behaviour described above:
<pre>
    rule string1 { (&lt;[&quot;'`]&gt;) ([ \\. | &lt;-[\\]&gt; ]*?) $1 }</pre>
<pre>
    $match = m/&lt;string1&gt;/;  # default: $match includes 
                            # opening and closing quotes</pre>
<pre>
    rule string2 { (&lt;[&quot;'`]&gt;) $0:=([ \\. | &lt;-[\\]&gt; ]*?) $1 }</pre>
<pre>
    $match = m/&lt;string2&gt;/;  # $match now excludes quotes
                            # because $0 explicitly bound 
                            # to second capture only</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>

<h3><a name="matching_against_nonstrings">Matching against non-strings</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Anything that can be tied to a string can be matched against a regex. This feature is particularly useful with input streams:
<pre>
    my @array := &lt;$fh&gt;;           # lazy when aliased
    my $array is from(\@array);   # tie scalar</pre>
<pre>
    # and later...</pre>
<pre>
    $array =~ m/pattern/;         # match from stream</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="grammars">Grammars</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
Potential ``collision'' problem with named regexes
</li><br />
<li>
Of course, a named <code>ident</code> regex shouldn't clobber someone else's <code>ident</code> regex.
</li><br />
<li>
So some mechanism is needed to confine regexes to a namespace.
</li><br />
<li>
If subs are the model for rules, then modules/classes are the obvious model for aggregating them.
</li><br />
<li>
Such collections of rules are generally known as ``grammars''.
</li><br />
<li>
Just as a class can collect named actions together:
<pre>
    class Identity {
        method name { &quot;Name = $.name&quot; }
        method age  { &quot;Age  = $.age&quot;  }
        method addr { &quot;Addr = $.addr&quot; }</pre>
<pre>
        method desc {
            print .name(), &quot;\n&quot;,
                  .age(),  &quot;\n&quot;,
                  .addr(), &quot;\n&quot;;
        }</pre>
<pre>
        # etc.
    }</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
So too a grammar can collect a set of named rules together:
<pre>
    grammar Identity {
        rule name :w { Name = (\N+) }
        rule age  :w { Age  = (\d+) }
        rule addr :w { Addr = (\N+) }
        rule desc {
            &lt;name&gt; \n
            &lt;age&gt;  \n
            &lt;addr&gt; \n
        }</pre>
<pre>
        # etc.
    }</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Like classes, grammars can inherit:
<pre>
    grammar Letter {
        rule text     { &lt;greet&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;close&gt; }</pre>
<pre>
        rule greet :w { [Hi|Hey|Yo] $to:=(\S+?) , $$}</pre>
<pre>
        rule body     { &lt;line&gt;+ }</pre>
<pre>
        rule close :w { Later dude, $from:=(.+) }</pre>
<pre>
        # etc.
    }</pre>
<pre>
    grammar FormalLetter is Letter {</pre>
<pre>
        rule greet :w { Dear $to:=(\S+?) , $$}</pre>
<pre>
        rule close :w { Yours sincerely, $from:=(.+) }</pre>
<pre>
    }</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Inherit rule definitions (polymorphically!)
</li><br />
<li>
So there's no need to respecify body, line, etc.
</li><br />
<li>
Perl 6 will come with at least one grammar predefined:
<pre>
    grammar Perl {    # Perl's own grammar</pre>
<pre>
        rule prog { &lt;line&gt;* }</pre>
<pre>
        rule line { &lt;decl&gt;
                  | &lt;loop&gt;
                  | &lt;label&gt; [&lt;cond&gt;|&lt;sideff&gt;|;]
        }</pre>
<pre>
        rule decl { &lt;sub&gt; | &lt;class&gt; | &lt;use&gt; }</pre>
<pre>
        # etc. etc.
    }</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Hence:
<pre>
    given $source_code {
        $parsetree = m/&lt;Perl::prog&gt;/;
    }</pre>
</li><br /></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="noshade">
<h3><a name="transliteration">Transliteration</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
The tr/// quote-like operator now also has a subroutine form.
</li><br />
<li>
It can be given either a single <code>PAIR</code>:
<pre>
    $str =~ tr( 'A-C' =&gt; 'a-c' );</pre>
</li><br />
<li>
Or a hash (or hash ref):

<p><i>In this article we will talk about tools that we need before we can start working on the performance of our service.</i></p>
<p>
</p>

<h2><a name="essential_tools">Essential Tools</a></h2>
<p>In order to improve performance, we need measurement tools. The main
tool categories are benchmarking and code profiling.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that, in a large number of the
benchmarking tests that we will execute, we will not look at the
absolute result numbers but the relation between two or more
result sets. The purpose of the benchmarks is to try to show which
coding approach is preferable. You shouldn't try to compare the
<strong>absolute</strong> results presented in the articles with those that you get
while running the same benchmarks on your machine, since you won't
have the exact hardware and software setup anyway. This kind of
comparison would be misleading.  If you compare the relative results
from the tests running on your machine, then you will do the right thing.</p>

<h3><a name="benchmarking_applications">Benchmarking Applications</a></h3>

<p>How much faster is mod_perl than mod_cgi (aka plain Perl/CGI)?  There
are many ways to benchmark the two.  I'll present a few examples and
numbers below.  Check out the <code>benchmark</code> directory of the mod_perl
distribution for more examples.</p>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/832" template="b/article_sidebar2.view">

<p>There is no need to write a special benchmark though.  If you want to
impress your boss or colleagues, then just take some heavy CGI script you
have (e.g. a script that crunches some data and prints the results to
STDOUT), open two xterms and call the same script in mod_perl mode in
one xterm and in mod_cgi mode in the other. You can use <code>lwp-get</code>
from the <code>LWP</code> package to emulate the browser.  The <code>benchmark</code>
directory of the mod_perl distribution includes such an example.</p>

<h4><a name="benchmarking_perl_code">Benchmarking Perl Code</a></h4>
<p>If you are going to write your own benchmarking utility, then use the
<code>Benchmark</code> module and the <code>Time::HiRes</code> module where you need
better time precision (&lt;10msec).</p>

<p>An example of the <code>Benchmark.pm</code> module usage:</p>

<pre><code>
  benchmark.pl
  ------------
  use Benchmark;
  
  timethis (1_000,
   sub {
    my $x = 100;
    my $y = log ($x ** 100)  for (0..10000);
  });

  % perl benchmark.pl
  timethis 1000: 25 wallclock secs (24.93 usr +  0.00 sys = 24.93 CPU)</code></pre>

<p>If you want to get the benchmark results in microseconds, then you will
have to use the <code>Time::HiRes</code> module. Its usage is similar to
<code>Benchmark</code>'s.</p>

<pre><code>
  use Time::HiRes qw(gettimeofday tv_interval);
  my $start_time = [ gettimeofday ];
  sub_that_takes_a_teeny_bit_of_time();
  my $end_time = [ gettimeofday ];
  my $elapsed = tv_interval($start_time,$end_time);
  print &quot;The sub took $elapsed seconds.&quot;</code></pre>

<h4><a name="benchmarking_a_graphic_hits_counter_with_persistent_db_connections">Benchmarking a Graphic Hits Counter with Persistent DB Connections</a></h4>
<p>Here are the numbers from Michael Parker's mod_perl presentation at
the Perl Conference (Aug, 98).  The script is a standard hits counter,
but it logs the counts into a mysql relational DataBase:</p>

<pre><code>
    Benchmark: timing 100 iterations of cgi, perl...  [rate 1:28]
    
    cgi: 56 secs ( 0.33 usr 0.28 sys = 0.61 cpu) 
    perl: 2 secs ( 0.31 usr 0.27 sys = 0.58 cpu) 
    
    Benchmark: timing 1000 iterations of cgi,perl...  [rate 1:21]
     
    cgi: 567 secs ( 3.27 usr 2.83 sys = 6.10 cpu) 
    perl: 26 secs ( 3.11 usr 2.53 sys = 5.64 cpu)      
    
    Benchmark: timing 10000 iterations of cgi, perl   [rate 1:21]
     
    cgi: 6494 secs (34.87 usr 26.68 sys = 61.55 cpu) 
    perl: 299 secs (32.51 usr 23.98 sys = 56.49 cpu)</code></pre>

<p>We don't know what server configurations were used for these tests,
but I guess the numbers speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The source code of the script was available online, but, sadly, isn't
anymore. However, you can reproduce the same performance speedup with
pretty much any CGI script written in Perl.</p>

<h4><a name="benchmarking_response_times_with_apachebench">Benchmarking Response Times With ApacheBench</a></h4>

<p>ApacheBench (<strong>ab</strong>) is a tool for benchmarking your Apache HTTP
server.  It is designed to give you an idea of the performance that
your current Apache installation can give.  In particular, it shows
you how many requests per second your Apache server is capable of
serving.  The <strong>ab</strong> tool comes bundled with the Apache source
distribution.</p>

<p>Let's try it.  We will simulate 10 users concurrently requesting a
light script at <code>www.example.com/perl/test.pl</code>.  Each simulated
user makes 10 requests.</p>

<pre><code>
  % ./ab -n 100 -c 10 www.example.com/perl/test.pl</code></pre>

<p>The results are:</p>

<pre><code>
  Document Path:          /perl/test.pl
  Document Length:        319 bytes
  
  Concurrency Level:      10
  Time taken for tests:   0.715 seconds
  Complete requests:      100
  Failed requests:        0
  Total transferred:      60700 bytes
  HTML transferred:       31900 bytes
  Requests per second:    139.86
  Transfer rate:          84.90 kb/s received
  
  Connection Times (ms)
                min   avg   max
  Connect:        0     0     3
  Processing:    13    67    71
  Total:         13    67    74</code></pre>

<p>We can see that under load of 10 concurrent users our server is
capable of processing 140 requests per second. Of course, this
benchmark is correct only when the script under test is used. We can
also learn about the average processing time, which in this case was
67 milliseconds. Other numbers reported by <code>ab</code> may or may not be of
interest to you.</p>

<p>For example, if we believe that the script <em>perl/test.pl</em> is not
efficient, then we will try to improve it and run the benchmark again to
see whether we have any improvement in performance.</p>

<h4><a name="benchmarking_response_times_with_httperf">Benchmarking Response Times With httperf</a></h4>

<p>httperf is a utility written by David Mosberger.  Just like
ApacheBench, it measures the performance of the Web server.</p>

<p>A sample command line is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>
  httperf --server hostname --port 80 --uri /test.html \
   --rate 150 --num-conn 27000 --num-call 1 --timeout 5</code></pre>

<p>This command causes httperf to use the Web server on the host with IP
name <code>hostname</code>, running at port 80.  The Web page being retrieved is
<em>/test.html</em> and, in this simple test, the same page is retrieved
repeatedly.  The rate at which requests are issued is 150 per second.
The test involves initiating a total of 27,000 TCP connections and on
each connection one HTTP call is performed.  A call consists of
sending a request and receiving a reply.</p>

<p>The timeout option defines the number of seconds that the client is
willing to wait to hear back from the server.  If this timeout
expires, then the tool considers the corresponding call to have failed.
Note that with a total of 27,000 connections and a rate of 150 per
second, the total test duration will be approximately 180 seconds
(27,000/150), independently of what load the server can actually
sustain.  Here is a result that one might get:</p>

<pre><code>
     Total: connections 27000 requests 26701 replies 26701 test-duration 179.996 s

<h4><a name="benchmarking_response_times_with_http_load">Benchmarking Response Times With http_load</a></h4>

<p><code>http_load</code> is yet another utility that does Web server load
testing. It can simulate a 33.6 modem connection (<em>-throttle</em>) and
allows you to provide a file with a list of URLs, which we be fetched
randomly. You can specify how many parallel connections to run using
the <em>-parallel N</em> option, or you can specify the number of requests
to generate per second with <em>-rate N</em> option. Finally, you can tell
the utility when to stop by specifying either the test time length
(<em>-seconds N</em>) or the total number of fetches (<em>-fetches N</em>).</p>
<p>A sample run with the file <em>urls</em> including:</p>

<pre><code>
  http://www.example.com/foo/
  http://www.example.com/bar/</code></pre>

<p>We ask to generate three requests per second and run for only two
seconds. Here is the generated output:</p>

<pre><code>
  % ./http_load -rate 3 -seconds 2 urls
  http://www.example.com/foo/: check-connect SUCCEEDED, ignoring
  http://www.example.com/bar/: check-connect SUCCEEDED, ignoring
  http://www.example.com/bar/: check-connect SUCCEEDED, ignoring
  http://www.example.com/bar/: check-connect SUCCEEDED, ignoring
  http://www.example.com/foo/: check-connect SUCCEEDED, ignoring
  5 fetches, 3 max parallel, 96870 bytes, in 2.00258 seconds
  19374 mean bytes/connection
  2.49678 fetches/sec, 48372.7 bytes/sec
  msecs/connect: 1.805 mean, 5.24 max, 0.79 min
  msecs/first-response: 291.289 mean, 560.338 max, 34.349 min</code></pre>
<p>So you can see that it has reported 2.5 requests per second. Of course,
for the real test you will want to load the server heavily and run the
test for a longer time to get more reliable results.</p>
<p>Note that when you provide a file with a list of URLs make sure that
you don't have empty lines in it. If you do, then the utility won't work,
complaining:</p>

<pre><code>
  ./http_load: unknown protocol -</code></pre>













<h4><a name="benchmarking_response_times_with_the_crashme_script">Benchmarking Response Times With crashme Script</a></h4>

<p>This is another crashme suite originally written by Michael Schilli
(and was located at <a href="http://www.linux-magazin.de">http://www.linux-magazin.de</a> site, but now the link
has gone).  I made a few modifications, mostly adding <code>my()</code> operators.
I also allowed it to accept more than one url to test, since sometimes
you want to test more than one script.</p>

<p>The tool provides the same results as <strong>ab</strong> above but it also allows
you to set the timeout value, so requests will fail if not served
within the time out period.  You also get values for <strong>Latency</strong>
(seconds per request) and <strong>Throughput</strong> (requests per second).  It can
do a complete simulation of your favorite Netscape browser :) and give
you a better picture.</p>

<p>I have noticed while running these two benchmarking suites, that <strong>ab</strong>
gave me results from two and a half to three times better.  Both
suites were run on the same machine, with the same load and the same
parameters, but the implementations were different.</p>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>
  URL(s):          http://www.example.com/perl/access/access.cgi
  Total Requests:  100
  Parallel Agents: 10
  Succeeded:       100 (100.00%)
  Errors:          NONE
  Total Time:      9.39 secs
  Throughput:      10.65 Requests/sec
  Latency:         0.85 secs/Request</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Apache::Timeit</code> module does <code>PerlHandler</code> Benchmarking.  With
the help of this module you can log the time taken to process the
request, just like you'd use the <code>Benchmark</code> module to benchmark a
regular Perl script.  Of course, you can extend this module to perform
more advanced processing like putting the results into a database for
a later processing.  But all it takes is adding this configuration
directive inside <em>httpd.conf</em>:</p>

<pre><code>
  PerlFixupHandler Apache::Timeit</code></pre>

<p>Since scripts running under <code>Apache::Registry</code> are running inside the
PerlHandler these are benchmarked as well.</p>

<p>An example of the lines which show up in the <em>error_log</em> file:</p>

<pre><code>
  timing request for /perl/setupenvoff.pl:
    0 wallclock secs ( 0.04 usr +  0.01 sys =  0.05 CPU)
  timing request for /perl/setupenvoff.pl:

<p>One of the big new features in perl 5.8 is that we now have real working 
threads available to us through the threads pragma.</p>

<p>However, for us module authors who already have to support our modules
on different versions of perl and different platforms, we now have to
deal with another case: threads! This article will show you how threads
relate to modules, how we can take old modules and make them
thread-safe, and round off with a new module that alters perl's behavior
of the "current working directory".</p>

<p>To run the examples I have shown here, you need perl 5.8 RC1 or later
compiled with threads. On Unix, you can use 
<code>Configure -Duseithreads -Dusethreads</code>; On Win32, the default build will 
always have threading enabled.</p>


<h3><a name="how_do_threads_relate_to_modules">How do threads relate to modules?</a></h3>
<p>Threading in Perl is based on the notion of explicit shared data. That
is, only data that is explicitly requested to be shared will be shared
between threads. This is controlled by the <code>threads::shared</code> pragma and
the "<code>: shared</code>" attribute. Witness how it works:</p>
<pre><code>
     use threads;
     my $var = 1;
     threads-&gt;create(sub { $var++ })-&gt;join();
     print $var;</code></pre>
<p>If you are accustomed to threading in most other languages, (Java/C) you 
would expect $var to contain a 2 and the result of this script to be 
"2". However since Perl does not share data between threads, $var is 
copied in the thread and only incremented in the thread. The original 
value in the main thread is not changed, so the output is "1".</p>

<p>However if we add in <code>threads::shared</code> and a <code>: shared</code> attribute we get 
the desired result:</p>
<pre><code>
     use threads;
     use threads::shared;
     my $var : shared = 1;
     threads-&gt;create(sub { $var++ })-&gt;join();
     print $var</code></pre>
<p>Now the result will be "2", since we declared $var to be a shared 
variable. Perl will then act on the same variable and provide automatic 
locking to keep the variable out of trouble.</p>

<p>This makes it quite a bit simpler for us module developers to make sure 
our modules are thread-safe. Essentially, all pure Perl modules are 
thread-safe because any global state data, which is usually what gives 
you thread-safety problems, is by default local to each thread.</p>


<h4><a name="definition_of_threadsafe_levels">Definition of thread-safe levels</a></h4>
<p>To define what we mean by thread-safety, here are some terms adapted
from the Solaris thread-safety levels.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_thread%2dsafe">thread-safe</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This module can safely be used from multiple threads. The effect of 
calling into a safe module is that the results are valid even when 
called  by multiple threads. However, thread-safe modules can still have 
global consequences; for example, sending or reading data from a socket 
affects all threads that are working with that socket. The application 
has the responsibility to act sane with regards to threads. If one 
thread creates a file with the name <em>file.tmp</em> then another file which 
tries to create it will fail; this is not the fault of the module.
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_thread%2dfriendly">thread-friendly</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
Thread-friendly modules are thread-safe modules that know about and 
provide special functions for working with threads or utilize threads by 
themselves. A typical example of this is the core <code>threads::queue</code> 
module. One could also imagine a thread-friendly module with a cache to 
declare that cache to be shared between threads to make hits more likely 
and save memory.
</dd>

<dt><strong><a name="item_thread%2dunsafe">thread-unsafe</a></strong><br />
</dt>
<dd>
This module can not safely be used from different threads; it is up to 
the application to synchronize access to the library and make sure it 
works with it the way it is specified. Typical examples here are XS 
modules that utilize external unsafe libraries that might only allow one 
thread to execute them.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Since Perl only shares when asked to, most pure Perl code probably falls
into the thread-safe category, that doesn't mean you should trust it
until you have review the source code or they have been marked with
thread-safe by the author. Typical problems include using alarm(),
mucking around with signals, working with relative paths and depending
on <code>%ENV</code>. However remember that ALL XS modules that don't state
anything fall into the definitive thread-unsafe category.</p>


<h3><a name="why_should_i_bother_making_my_module_threadsafe_or_threadfriendly">Why should I bother making my module thread-safe or thread-friendly?</a></h3>

<p>Well, it usually isn't much work and it will make the users of this 
modules that want to use it in a threaded environment very happy. What? 
Threaded Perl environments aren't that common you say? Wait until Apache 
2.0 and mod_perl 2.0 becomes available. One big change is that Apache 
2.0 can run in threaded mode and then mod_perl will have to be run in 
threaded mode; this can be a huge performance gain on some operating 
systems. So if you want your modules to work with mod_perl 2.0, taking a 
look at thread-safety levels is a good thing to do.</p>


<h3><a name="so_what_do_i_do_to_make_my_module_threadfriendly">So what do I do to make my module thread-friendly?</a></h3>
<p>A good example of a module that needed a little modification to work
with threads is Michael Schwern's most excellent <code>Test::Simple</code> suite
(<code>Test::Simple</code>, <code>Test::More</code> and <code>Test::Builder</code>). Surprisingly, we
had to change very little to fix it.</p>
<p>The problem was simply that the test numbering was not shared between 
threads.</p>

<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>
     use threads;
     use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 3;
     ok(1);
     threads-&gt;create(sub { ok(1) })-&gt;join();
     ok(1);</code></pre>
	 
<p>Now that will return</p>

<pre><code>
     1..3
     ok 1
     ok 2
     ok 2</code></pre>
<p>Does it look similar to the problem we had earlier? Indeed it does, 
seems like somewhere there is a variable that needs to shared.</p>

<p>Now reading the documentation of <code>Test::Simple</code> we find out that all magic 
is really done inside <code>Test::Builder</code>, opening up <em>Builder.pm</em> we quickly 
find the following lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>
     my @Test_Results = ();
     my @Test_Details = ();
     my $Curr_Test = 0;</code></pre>
<p>Now we would be tempted to add <code>use threads::shared</code> and <code>:shared</code> 
attribute.</p>

<pre><code>
     use threads::shared;
     my @Test_Results : shared = ();
     my @Test_Details : shared = ();
     my $Curr_Test : shared = 0;</code></pre>
<p>However <code>Test::Builder</code> needs to work back to Perl 5.4.4! Attributes
were only added in 5.6.0 and the above code would be a syntax error in
earlier Perls. And even if someone were using 5.6.0, <code>threads::shared</code>
would not be available for them.</p>

<p>The solution is to use the runtime function <code>share()</code> exported by 
<code>threads::shared</code>, but we only want to do it for 5.8.0 and when threads 
have been enabled. So, let's wrap it in a <code>BEGIN</code> block and an <code>if</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
     BEGIN{
         if($] &gt;= 5.008 &amp;&amp; exists($INC{'threads.pm'})) {
             require threads::shared;
             import threads::shared qw(share);
             share($Curr_Test);
             share(@Test_Details)
             share(@Test_Results);
         }</code></pre>
<p>So, if 5.8.0 or higher and threads has been loaded, we do the runtime 
equivalent of <code>use threads::shared qw(share);</code> and call <code>share()</code> on 
the variables we want to be shared.</p>
<p>Now lets find out some examples of where <code>$Curr_Test</code> is used. We find
<code>sub ok {}</code> in <code>Test::Builder</code>; I won't include it here, but only a
smaller version which contains:</p>
<pre><code>
     sub ok {
         my($self, $test, $name) = @_;
         $Curr_Test++;
         $Test_Results[$Curr_Test-1] = 1 unless($test);
     }</code></pre>
<p>Now, this looks like it should work right? We have shared $Curr_Test 
and <code>@Test_Results</code>. Of course, things aren't that easy; they never are. 
Even if the variables are shared, two threads could enter <code>ok()</code> at the 
same time. Remember that not even the statement <code>$CurrTest++</code> is an 
atomic operation, it is just a shortcut for writing 
<code>$CurrTest = $CurrTest + 1</code>. So let's say two threads do that at the same time.</p>
<pre><code>
     Thread 1: add 1 + $Curr_Test
     Thread 2: add 1 + $Curr_Test
     Thread 2: Assign result to $Curr_Test
     Thread 1: Assign result to $Curr_Test</code></pre>
<p>The effect would be that $Curr_Test would only be increased by one, not 
two! Remember that a switch between two threads could happen at <strong>ANY</strong> 
time, and if you are on a multiple CPU machine they can run at exactly 
the same time! Never trust thread inertia.</p>

<p>So how do we solve it? We use the <code>lock()</code> keyword. <code>lock()</code> takes a shared 
variable and locks it for the rest of the scope, but it is only an 
advisory lock so we need to find every place that $Curr_Test is used and 
modified and it is expected not to change. The <code>ok()</code> becomes:</p>
<pre><code>
     sub ok {
         my($self, $test, $name) = @_;
         lock($Curr_Test);
         $Curr_Test++;
         $Test_Results[$Curr_Test-1] = 1 unless($test);
     }</code></pre>
	 
<p>So are we ready? Well, <code>lock()</code> was only added in Perl 5.5 so we need to 
add an else to the BEGIN clause to define a lock function if we aren't 
running with threads. The end result would be.</p>

<pre><code>
     my @Test_Results = ();
     my @Test_Details = ();
     my $Curr_Test = 0;
     BEGIN{
         if($] &gt;= 5.008 &amp;&amp; exists($INC{'threads.pm'})) {
             require threads::shared;
             import threads::shared qw(share);
             share($Curr_Test);
             share(@Test_Details)
             share(@Test_Results);
         } else {
             *lock = sub(*) {};
         }
     }
     sub ok {
         my($self, $test, $name) = @_;
         lock($Curr_Test);
         $Curr_Test++;
         $Test_Results[$Curr_Test-1] = 1 unless($test);
     }</code></pre>
	 
<p>In fact, this is very like the code that has been added to <code>Test::Builder</code>
to make it work nice with threads. The only thing not correct is <code>ok()</code> as 
I cut it down to what was relevant. There were roughly 5 places where 
<code>lock()</code> had to be added. Now the test code would print</p>

<pre><code>
     1..3
     ok 1
     ok 2
     ok 3</code></pre>
<p>which is exactly what the end user would expect. All in all this is a 
rather small change for this 1291 line module, we change roughly 15 
lines in a non intrusive way, the documentation and testcase code makes 
up most of the patch. The full patch is at

<h3><a name="altering_perls_behavior_to_be_threadsafe,_ex::threads::cwd">Altering Perls behavior to be thread-safe, ex::threads::cwd</a></h3>
<p>Somethings change when you use threads; some things that you or a module
might do are not like what they used to be. Most of the changes will be
due to the way your operating system treats processes that use threads.
Each process has typically a set of attributes, which include the
current working directory, the environment table, the signal subsystem
and the pid. Since threads are multiple paths of execution inside a
single process, the operating system treats it as a single process and
you have a single set of these attributes.</p>
<p>Yep. That's right - if you change the current working directory in one 
thread, it will also change in all the other threads! Whoops, better 
start using absolute paths everywhere, and all the code that uses your
module might use relative paths. Aaargh...</p>

<p>Don't worry, this is a solvable problem. In fact, it's solvable by a module.</p>

<p>Perl allows us to override functions using the <code>CORE::GLOBAL</code> namespace.
This will let us override the functions that deal with paths and set the 
<code>cwd</code> correctly before issuing the command. So let's start off</p>

<pre><code>
     package ex::threads::safecwd;

     use 5.008;
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use threads::shared;
     our $VERSION = '0.01';</code></pre>
<p>Nothing weird here right? Now, when changing and dealing with the 
current working directory one often uses the <code>Cwd</code> module, so let us make 
the cwd module safe first. How do we do that?</p>

<pre><code>
  1) use Cwd;
  2) our $cwd = cwd;  #our per thread cwd, init on startup from cwd
  3) our $cwd_mutex : shared; # the variable we use to sync
  4) our $Cwd_cwd = \&amp;Cwd::cwd;
  5) *Cwd::cwd = *my_cwd;     
     sub my_cwd {
  6)     lock($cwd_mutex);
  7)     CORE::chdir($cwd);
  8)     $Cwd_cwd-&gt;(@_);
     }</code></pre>

<p>What's going on here? Let's analyze it line by line:</p>
<ol>
<li>
We include <code>Cwd</code>.</li>

<li>
We declare a variable and assign to it the cwd we start in.
This variable will not be shared between threads and will contain the 
cwd of this thread.</li>

<li>
We declare a variable we will be using to lock for synchronizing work.</li>

<li>
Here we take a reference to the <code>&amp;Cwd::cwd</code> and store in <code>$Cwd_cwd</code>.</li>

<li>
Now we hijack <code>Cwd::cwd</code> and assign to it our own <code>my_cwd</code> so 
whenever someone calls <code>Cwd::cwd</code>, it will call <code>my_cwd</code> instead.</li>

<li>
<code>my_cwd</code> starts of by locking $cwd_mutex so no one else will muck.
around with the cwd.</li>

<li>
After that we call <code>CORE::chdir()</code> to actually set the cwd to 
what this thread is expecting it to be.</li>
<p></p>
<li>
And we round off by calling the original <code>Cwd::cwd</code> that we 
stored in step 4 with any parameters that we were handed to us.</li>
</ol>

<p>In effect we have hijacked <code>Cwd::cwd</code> and wrapped it around with a lock 
and a <code>chdir</code> so it will report the correct thing!</p>

<p>Now that <code>cwd()</code> is fixed, we need a way to actually change the
directory. To do this, we install our own global <code>chdir</code>, simply like
this.</p>

<pre><code>
     *CORE::GLOBAL::chdir = sub {
         lock($cwd_mutex);
         CORE::chdir($_[0]) || return undef;
         $cwd = $Cwd_cwd-&gt;();
     };</code></pre>
	 
<p>Now, whenever someone calls <code>chdir()</code> our <code>chdir</code> will be called
instead, and in it we start by locking the variable controlling access,
then we try to chdir to the directory to see if it is possible,
otherwise we do what the real chdir would do, return undef. If it
succeeds, we assign the new value to our per thread <code>$cwd</code> by calling the
original <code>Cwd::cwd()</code></p>

<p>The above code is actually enough to allow the following to work:</p>

<pre><code>
     use threads
     use ex::threads::safecwd;
     use Cwd;
     chdir(&quot;/tmp&quot;);
     threads-&gt;create(sub { chdir(&quot;/usr&quot;) } )-&gt;join();
     print cwd() eq '/tmp' ? &quot;ok&quot; : &quot;nok&quot;;</code></pre>

<p>Since the <code>chdir(&quot;/usr&quot;);</code> inside the thread will not affect the other 
thread's <code>$cwd</code> variable, so when <code>cwd</code> is called, we will lock down the 
thread, <code>chdir()</code> to the location the thread <code>$cwd</code> contains and perform a 
<code>cwd()</code>.</p>

<p>While this is useful, we need to get along and provide some more 
functions to extend the functionality of this module.</p>

<pre><code>
     *CORE::GLOBAL::mkdir = sub {
         lock($cwd_mutex);
         CORE::chdir($cwd);
         if(@_ &gt; 1) {
             CORE::mkdir($_[0], $_[1]);
         } else {
             CORE::mkdir($_[0]);
         }
     };

     *CORE::GLOBAL::rmdir = sub {
         lock($cwd_mutex);
         CORE::chdir($cwd);
         CORE::rmdir($_[0]);
     };</code></pre>
	 
<p>The above snippet does essentially the same thing for both <code>mkdir</code> and
<code>rmdir</code>. We lock the $cwd_mutex to synchronize access, then we <code>chdir</code> to
<code>$cwd</code> and finally perform the action. Worth noticing here is the check we
need to do for <code>mkdir</code> to be sure the prototype behavior for it is
correct.</p>

<p>Let's move on with <code>opendir</code>, <code>open</code>, <code>readlink</code>, <code>readpipe</code>,
<code>require</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>stat</code>, <code>symlink</code>, <code>system</code> and <code>unlink</code>. None
of these are really any different from the above with the big exception
of <code>open</code>. <code>open</code> has a weird bit of special case since it can take
both a HANDLE and an empty scalar for autovification of an anonymous
handle.</p>

<pre><code>
     *CORE::GLOBAL::open = sub (*;$@) {
         lock($cwd_mutex);
         CORE::chdir($cwd);
         if(defined($_[0])) {
             use Symbol qw();
             my $handle = Symbol::qualify($_[0],(caller)[0]);
             no strict 'refs';
             if(@_ == 1) {
                 return CORE::open($handle);
             } elsif(@_ == 2) {
               return CORE::open($handle, $_[1]);
             } else {
               return CORE::open($handle, $_[1], @_[2..$#_]);
             }
         }</code></pre>
		 
<p>Starting off with the usual lock and <code>chdir()</code> we then need to check if 
the first value is defined. If it is, we have to qualify it to the 
callers namespace. This is what would happen if a user does 
<code>open FOO, &quot;+&gt;foo.txt&quot;</code>. If the user instead does 
<code>open main::FOO, &quot;+&gt;foo.txt&quot;</code>,  
then Symbol::qualify notices that the handle is already qualified and 
returns it unmodified. Now since <code>$_[0]</code> is a readonly alias we cannot 
assign it over so we need to create a temporary variable and then 
proceed as usual.</p>

<p>Now if the user used the new style <code>open my $foo, &quot;+&gt;foo.txt&quot;</code>, we need 
to treat it differently. The following code will do the trick and 
complete the function.</p>

<pre><code>
     else {
             if(@_ == 1) {
                 return CORE::open($_[0]);
             } elsif(@_ == 2) {
                 return CORE::open($_[0], $_[1]);
             } else {
                 return CORE::open($_[0], $_[1], @_[2..$#_]);
             }
         }
     };</code></pre>
	 
<p>Wonder why we couldn't just assign <code>$_[0]</code> to <code>$handle</code> and unify the code 
path? You see,  <code>$_[0]</code> is an alias to the <code>$foo</code> in 
<code>open my $foo, &quot;+&gt;foo.txt&quot;</code> so <code>CORE::open</code> will correctly work.</p>

<p>However, if we do <code>$handle = $_[0]</code> we take a copy of the undefined
variable and <code>CORE::open</code> won't do what I mean.</p>

<p>So now we have a module that allows the you to safely use relative paths
in most of the cases and vastly improves your ability to port code to a
threaded environment. The price we pay for this is speed, since every
time you do an operation involving a directory you are serializing your
program. Typically, you never do those kinds of operations in a hot path
anyway. You might do work on your file in a hot path, but as soon as we
have gotten the filehandle no more locking is done.</p>

<p>A couple of problems remain. Performance-wise, there is one big problem
with <code>system()</code>, since we don't get control back until the
<code>CORE::system()</code> returns, so all path operations will hang waiting for
that. To solve that we would need to revert to XS and do some magic with
regard to the system call. We also haven't been able to override the
file test operators (<code>-x</code> and friends), nor can we do anything about
<code>qx {}</code>. Solving that problem requires working up and down the optree
using <code>B::Generate</code> and <code>B::Utils</code>. Perhaps a future version of the
module will attempt that together with a custom op to do the locking.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Threads in Perl are simple and straight forward, as long as we stay in 
pure Perl land everything behaves just about how we would expect it to. 
Converting your modules should be a simple matter of programming without 
any big wizardly things to be done. The important thing to remember is 
to think about how your module could possibly take advantage of threads 
to make it easier to use for the programmer.</p>

<p>Moving over to XS land is altogether different; stay put for the next 
article that will take us through the pitfalls of converting various 
kinds of XS modules to thread-safe and thread-friendly levels.</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>

<p>This is the Apocalypse on Pattern Matching, generally having to do
with what we call &quot;regular expressions&quot;, which are only marginally
related to real regular expressions.  Nevertheless, the term has
grown with the capabilities of our pattern matching engines, so
I'm not going to try to fight linguistic necessity here.  I will,
however, generally call them &quot;regexes&quot; (or &quot;regexen&quot;, when I'm in
an Anglo-Saxon mood).</p>
<p>Here are the RFCs covered in this Apocalypse.  PSA stands for &quot;problem,
solution, acceptance&quot;, my private rating of how this RFC will fit
into Perl 6.  Doubtless I have misclassified <em>your</em> RFC, though
the other ratings are pretty accurate.  <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>Interestingly, there were no withdrawn RFCs for pattern
matching.  That means either that there were no cork-brained ideas
proposed, or that regex culture is so cork-brained already that the
cork-brained ideas blend right in.  I know where my money is...  <code>:-)</code></p>
<p>In fact, regular expression culture is a mess, and I share some of
the blame for making it that way.  Since my mother always told me to
clean up my own messes, I suppose I'll have to do just that.</p>

<p>For prior Apocalypses, I've used the RFCs as a springboard for
discussion of my thinking, but this one is special, because none of
the RFCs were courageous enough (or foolhardy enough) to look at the big
picture and propose radical change where it's needed.  But Perl has
often been tagged as a language in which it's easy to write programs
that are difficult to read, and it's no secret that regular expression
syntax that has been the chief culprit.  Funny that other languages have
been borrowing Perl's regular expressions as fast as they can...</p>

<p>That's primarily because we took several large steps in Perl 5 to
enhance regex capabilities.  We took one large step forwards with the
<code>/x</code> option, which allowed whitespace between regex tokens.  But we
also took several large steps sideways with the <code>(?...)</code> extension
syntax.  I call them steps sideways, but they were simultaneously
steps forward in terms of functionality and steps backwards in terms
of readability.  At the time, I rationalized it all in the name of
backward compatibility, and perhaps that approach was correct for that
time and place.  It's not correct now, since the Perl 6 approach is
to break everything that needs breaking all at once.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, there's a lot of regex culture that needs breaking.</p>

<p>Regex culture has gone wrong in a variety of ways, but it's not
my intent to assign blame--there's plenty of blame to go around,
and plenty of things that have gone wrong that are nobody's fault
in particular.  For example, it's nobody's fault that you can't
realistically complement a character set anymore.  It's just an
accident of the way Unicode defines combining characters.  The whole
notion of character classes is mutating, and that will have some
bearing on the future of regular expression syntax.</p>
<p>Given all this, I need to warn you that this Apocalypse is going to
be somewhat radical.  We'll be proposing changes to certain &quot;sacred&quot;
features of regex culture, and this is guaranteed to result in future
shock for some of our more conservative citizens.  Do not be alarmed.
We will provide ways for you to continue programming in old-fashioned
regular expressions if you desire.  But I hope that once you've
thought about it a little and worked through some examples, you'll
like most of the changes we're proposing here.</p>
<p>So although the RFCs did contribute greatly to my thinking for
this Apocalypse, I'm going to present my own vision first for where
regex culture should go, and then analyze the RFCs with respect to
that vision.</p>
<p>First, let me enumerate some of the things that are wrong with current
regex culture.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Too much history
<p></p>
<li>
Too compact and &quot;cute&quot;
<p></p>
<li>
Poor Huffman coding
<p></p>
<li>
Too much reliance on too few metacharacters
<p></p>
<li>
Different things look too similar
<p></p>
<li>
Poor end-weight design
<p></p>
<li>
Too much reliance on modifiers
<p></p>
<li>
Too many special rules and boobytraps
<p></p>
<li>
Backreferences not useful enough
<p></p>
<li>
Too hard to match a literal string
<p></p>
<li>
Two-level interpretation is problematic
<p></p>
<li>
Too little abstraction
<p></p>
<li>
Little support for named captures
<p></p>
<li>
Difficult to use nested patterns
<p></p>
<li>
Little support for grammars
<p></p>
<li>
Inability to define variants
<p></p>
<li>
Poor integration with &quot;real&quot; language
<p></p>
<li>
Missing backtracking controls
<p></p>
<li>
Difficult to define assertions
<p></p></ul>
<p>I'm sure there are other problems, but that'll do for starters.  Let's
look at each of these in more detail.</p>











<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>


<p>
<h3><a name="too much history">Too much history</a></h3>
<p>Most of the other problems stem from trying to deal with a rich history.
Now there's nothing wrong with history per se, but those of us who are doomed
to repeat it find that many parts of history are suboptimal and contradictory.
Perl has always tried to err on the side of incorporating as much history
as possible, and sometimes Perl has succeeded in that endeavor.</p>
<p>Cultural continuity has much to be said for it, but what can you do when
the culture you're trying to be continuous with is itself discontinuous?  As
it says in Ecclesiastes, there's a time to build up, and a time to tear down.
The first five versions of Perl mostly built up without tearing down, so
now we're trying to redress that omission.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="too compact and cute">Too compact and &quot;cute&quot;</a></h3>
<p>Regular expressions were invented by computational linguists who love to
write examples like <code>/aa*b*(cd)*ee/</code>.  While these are conducive to reasoning
about pattern matching in the abstract, they aren't so good for pattern matching
in the concrete.  In real life, most atoms are longer than &quot;<code>a</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>b</code>&quot;.  In real
life, tokens are more recognizable if they are separated by whitespace.  In the
abstract, <code>/a+/</code> is reducible to <code>/aa*/</code>.  In real life, nobody wants to
repeat a 15 character token merely to satisfy somebody's idea of theoretical
purity.  So we have shortcuts like the <code>+</code> quantifier to say &quot;one or more&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, you may rightly point out that <code>+</code> is something we already have,
and we already introduced <code>/x</code> to allow whitespace, so why is this
bullet point here?  Well, there's a lot of inertia in culture, and
the problem with <code>/x</code> is that it's not the default, so people don't think
to turn it on when it would probably do a lot of good.  The culture
is biased in the wrong direction.  Whitespace around tokens should
be the norm, not the exception.  It should be acceptable to use
whitespace to separate tokens that could be confused.  It should not be
considered acceptable to define new constructs that contain a plethora
of punctuation, but we've become accustomed to constructs like <code>(?&lt;=...)</code>
and <code>(??{...})</code> and <code>[\r\n\ck\p{Zl}\p{Zp}]</code>,
so we don't complain.  We're frogs who are getting boiled in a pot
full of single-character morphemes, and we don't notice.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="poor huffman coding">Poor Huffman coding</a></h3>
<p>Huffman invented a method of data compaction in which common characters are
represented by a small number of bits, and rarer characters are represented by
more bits.  The principle is more general, however, and language designers
would do well to pay attention to the &quot;other&quot; Perl slogan: Easy things should
be easy, and hard things should be possible.  However, we haven't always taken
our own advice.  Consider those two regex constructs we just saw:</p>
<pre>
    (?&lt;=...)
    (??{...})</pre>
<p>Which one do you think is likely to be the most common in everyday use?
Guess which one is longer...</p>
<p>There are many examples of poor Huffman coding in current regexes.  Consider
these:</p>
<pre>
    (...)
    (?:...)</pre>
<p>Is it really the case that grouping is rarer than capturing?
And by two gobbledygooky character's worth?  Likewise there are
many constructs that are the same length that shouldn't be:</p>
<pre>
    (?:...)
    (?#...)</pre>
<p>Grouping is much more important than the ability to embed a comment.
Yet they're the same length currently.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="too much reliance on too few metacharacters">Too much reliance on too few metacharacters</a></h3>
<p>A lot of our Huffman troubles came about because we were trying to
shoehorn new capabilities into an old syntax without breaking anything.
The <code>(?...)</code> construct succeeded at that goal, but it was new
wine in old wineskins, as they say.  More successful was the <code>*?</code>
minimal matching hack, but it's still symptomatic of the problem
that we only had three characters to choose from that would have
worked at that point in the grammar.  We've pretty nearly exhausted
the available backslash sequences.</p>
<p>The waterbed theory of linguistic complexity says that if you push
down one place, it goes up somewhere else.  If you arbitrarily
limit yourself to too few metacharacters, the complexity comes out
somewhere else.  So it seems obvious to me that the way out of this
mess is to grab a few more metacharacters.  And the metacharacters
I want to grab are...well, we'll see in a moment.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="different things look too similar">Different things look too similar</a></h3>
<p>Consider these constructs:</p>
<pre>
    (??{...})
    (?{...})
    (?#...)
    (?:...)
    (?i:...)
    (?=...)
    (?!...)
    (?&lt;=...)
    (?&lt;!...)
    (?&gt;...)
    (?(...)...|...)</pre>
<p>These all look quite similar, but some of them do radically different things.
In particular, the <code>(?&lt;...)</code> does not mean the opposite of the <code>(?&gt;...)</code>.  The
underlying visual problem is the overuse of parentheses, as in Lisp.
Programs are more readable if different things look different.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="poor endweight design">Poor end-weight design</a></h3>
<p>In linguistics, the notion of end-weight is the idea that people tend
to prefer sentences where the short things come first and the long
things come last.  That minimizes the amount of stuff you have to
remember while you're reading or listening.  Perl violates this with
regex modifiers.  It's okay when you say something short like this:</p>
<pre>
    s/foo/bar/g</pre>
<p>But when you say something like we find in RFC 360:</p>
<pre>
    while ($text =~ /name:\s*(.*?)\n\s*
                    children:\s*(?:(?@\S+)[, ]*)*\n\s*
                    favorite\ colors:\s*(?:(?@\S+)[, ]*)*\n/sigx) {...}</pre>
<p>it's not until you read the <code>/sigx</code> at the end that you know how to
read the regex.  This actually causes problems for the Perl 5 parser,
which has to defer parsing the regular expression till it sees
the <code>/x</code>, because that changes how whitespace and comments work.</p>











<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>


<p>
<h3><a name="too much reliance on modifiers">Too much reliance on modifiers</a></h3>
<p>The <code>/s</code> modifier in the previous example changes the meaning of
the <code>.</code> metacharacter.  We could, in fact, do away with the <code>/s</code> modifier
entirely if we only had two different representations for &quot;any character&quot;,
one of which matched a newline, and one which didn't.  A similar argument
applies to the <code>/m</code> modifier.  The whole notion of something outside
the regex changing the meaning of the regex is just a bit bogus, not because
we're afraid of context sensitivity, but because we need to have better
control within the regex of what we mean, and in this case the context
supplied outside the regex is not precise enough.  (Perl 5 has a way
to control the inner contexts, but it uses the self-obfuscating <code>(?...)</code>
notation.)</p>
<p>Modifiers that control how the regex is used as a whole do make some
sense outside the regex.  But they still have the end-weight problem.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="too many special rules and boobytraps">Too many special rules and boobytraps</a></h3>
<p>Without knowing the context, you cannot know what the pattern <code>//</code> will do.
It might match a null string, or it might match the previously successful match.</p>
<p>The <code>local</code> operator behaves differently inside regular expressions than
it does outside.</p>
<p>It's too easy to write a null pattern accidentally.  For instance,
the following will never match anything but the null string:</p>
<pre>
    /
    | foo
    | bar
    | baz
    /x</pre>
<p>Even when it's intentional, it may not look intentional:</p>
<pre>
    (a|b|c|)</pre>
<p>That's hard to read because it's difficult to make the absence of something visible.</p>
<p>It's too easy to confuse the multiple meanings of dot.  Or the multiple
meanings of <code>^</code>, and <code>$</code>.  And the opposite of <code>\A</code> is frequently
not <code>\Z</code>, but <code>\z</code>.  Tell me again, when do I say <code>\1</code>, and when
do I say <code>$1</code>?  Why are they different?</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="backreferences not useful enough">Backreferences not useful enough</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of <code>\1</code>, backreferences have a number of shortcomings.
The first is actually getting ahold of the right backreference.
Since captures are numbered from the beginning, you have to count,
and you can easily count wrong.  For many purposes it would be better if you
could ask for the last capture, or the one before that.  Or perhaps
if there were a way to restart the numbering part way through...</p>
<p>Another major problem with backreferences is that you can't easily
modify one to search for a variant.  Suppose you match an opening parenthesis,
bracket, or curly.  You'll like to search for everything up to the corresponding
closing parenthesis, bracket, or curly, but there's no way to transmogrify
the opening version to the closing version, because the backref search
is hardwired independently of ordinary variable matching.  And that's because
Perl doesn't instantiate <code>$1</code> soon enough.  And that's because Perl relies on
variable interpolation to get subexpressions into regexes.  Which leads us
to...</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="too hard to match a literal string">Too hard to match a literal string</a></h3>
<p>Since regexes undergo an interpolation pass before they're compiled,
anything you interpolate is forced to be treated as a regular
expression.  Often that's not what you want, so we have the klunky
<code>\Q$string\E</code> mechanism to hide regex metacharacters.  And that's
because...</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="twolevel interpretation is problematic">Two-level interpretation is problematic</a></h3>
<p>The problem with <code>\Q$string\E</code> arises because of the fundamental
mistake of using interpolation to build regexes instead of letting
the regex control how it treats the variables it references.  Regexes
aren't strings, they're programs.  Or, rather, they're strings only in the sense
that any piece of program is a string.  Just as you have to work to
eval a string as a program, you should have to work to eval a string
as a regular expression.  Most people tend to expect a variable in
a regular expression to match its contents literally.  Perl violates
that expectation.  And because it violates that expectation, we can't
make <code>$1</code> synonymous with <code>\1</code>.  And interpolated parentheses throw
off the capture count, so you can't easily use interpolation to call
subrules, so we invented <code>(??{$var})</code> to get around that.  But then
you can't actually get at the parentheses captured by the subrule.
The ramifications go on and on.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="too little abstraction">Too little abstraction</a></h3>
<p>Historically, regular expressions were considered a very low-level
language, a kind of glorified assembly language for the regex engine.
When you're only dealing with ASCII, there is little need for abstraction,
since the shortest way to say <code>[a-z]</code> is just that.  With the advent
of the eighth bit, we started getting into a little bit of trouble,
and POSIX started thinking about names like <code>[:alpha:]</code> to deal with
locale difficulties.  But as with the problem of conciseness, the
culture was still biased away from naming abstractly anything that could be
expressed concretely.</p>
<p>However, it's almost impossible to write a parser without naming things,
because you have to be able to name the separate grammar rules
so that the various rules can refer to each other.</p>
<p>It's difficult to deal with any subset of Unicode without naming it.
These days, if you see <code>[a-z]</code> in a program, it's probably an
outright bug.  It's much better to use a named character property so
that your program will work right in areas that don't just use ASCII.</p>
<p>Even where we do allow names, it tends to be awkward because of the
cultural bias against it.  To call a subrule by name in Perl 5 you
have to say this:</p>
<pre>
    (??{$rule})</pre>
<p>That has 4 or 5 more characters than it ought to.  Dearth of
abstraction produces bad Huffman coding.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="little support for named captures">Little support for named captures</a></h3>
<p>Make that &quot;no support&quot; in Perl, unless you include assignment to a list.
This is just a part of the bias against naming things.  Instead we
are forced to number our capturing parens and count.  That works okay
for the top-level regular expression, when we can do list assignment
or assign <code>$1</code> to <code>$foo</code>.  But it breaks down as soon as you start
trying to use nested regexes.  It also breaks down when the capturing
parentheses match more than once.  Perl handles this currently by
returning only the last match.  This is slightly better than useless,
but not by much.</p>











<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>

<p>
<h3><a name="difficult to use nested patterns">Difficult to use nested patterns</a></h3>
<p>For many of the reasons we've mentioned, it's difficult to make regexes
refer to each other, and even if you do, it's almost impossible to
get the nested information back out of them.  And there are entire
classes of parsing problems that are not solvable without
recursive definitions.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="little support for grammars">Little support for grammars</a></h3>
<p>Even if it were easier for regexes to refer to other regexes, we'd
still have the problem that those other regexes aren't organized in
any meaningful way.  They might be off in variables that come and go
at the whim of the surrounding context.</p>
<p>When we have an organized system of parsing rules, we call it a
grammar.  One advantage of having a grammar is that you can optimize
based on the assumption that the rules maintain their relationship to
each other.  For instance, if you think of grammar rules as a funny
kind of subroutine, you can write an optimizer to inline some of the
subrules--but only if you know the subrule is fixed in the grammar.</p>
<p>Without support for grammar classes, there's no decent way to think
of deriving one grammar from another.  And if you can't derive one
grammar from another, you can't easily evolve your language to handle
new kinds of problems.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="inability to define variants">Inability to define variants</a></h3>
<p>If we want to have variant grammars for Perl dialects, then what about
regex dialects?  Can regexes be extended either at compile time or at
run time?  Perl 5 has some rudimentary overloading magic for rewriting
regex strings, but that's got the same problems as source filters
for Perl code; namely that you just get the raw regex source text and
have to parse it yourself.  Once again the fundamental assumption is
that a regex is a funny kind of string, existing only at the behest
of the surrounding program.</p>
<p>Do we think of regexes as a real, living language?</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="poor integration with rich languages">Poor integration with rich languages</a></h3>
<p>Let's face it, in the culture of computing, regex languages are mostly
considered second-class citizens, or worse.  &quot;Real&quot; languages like
C and C++ will exploit regexes, but only through a strict policy of
apartheid.  Regular expressions are our servants or slaves; we tell them
what to do, they go and do it, and then they come back to say whether
they succeeded or not.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, we have languages like Prolog or Snobol where
the pattern matching is built into the very control structure of the language.
These languages don't succeed in the long run because thinking about
that kind of control structure is rather difficult in actual fact, and
one gets tired of doing it constantly.  The path to freedom is not to
make everyone a slave.</p>
<p>However, I would like to think that there is some happy medium between
those two extremes.  Coming from a C background, Perl has historically
treated regexes as servants.  True, Perl has treated them as trusted
servants, letting them move about in Perl society better than any other
C-like language to date.  Nevertheless, if we emancipate regexes to
serve as co-equal control structures, and if we can rid ourselves of
the regexist attitudes that many of us secretly harbor, we'll have
a much more productive society than we currently do.  We need to
empower regexes with a sense of control (structure).  It needs to
be just as easy for a regex to call Perl code as it is for Perl
code to call a regex.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="missing backtracking controls">Missing backtracking controls</a></h3>
<p>Perl 5 started to give regexes more control of their own destiny with
the &quot;grab&quot; construct, <code>(?&gt;...)</code>, which tells the regex engine
that when it fails to match the rest of the pattern, it should not
backtrack into the innards of the grab, but skip back to before it.  That's
a useful notion, but there are problems.  First, the notation sucks, but
you knew that already.  Second, it doesn't go far enough.  There's no
way to backtrack out of just the current grouping.  There's no way to backtrack
out of just the current rule.  Both of these are crucial for giving first-class
status to the control flow of regexes.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="difficult to define assertions">Difficult to define assertions</a></h3>
<p>Notionally, a regex is an organization of assertions that either
succeed or fail.  Some assertions are easily expressed in traditional
regex language, while others are more easily expressed in a procedural
language like Perl.</p>
<p>The natural (but wrong) solution is to try to reinvent Perl expressions
within regex language.  So, for instance, I'm rejecting those RFCs that
propose special assertion syntax for numerics or booleans.  The better
solution is to make it easier to embed Perl assertions within regexes.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="brave new world">Brave New World</a></h3>
<p>I've just made a ton of negative assertions about the current state
of regex culture.  Now I'd like you to perform a cool mental trick
and turn all those negatives assertions into positive assertions about
what I'm going to say, because I'm not intending to give the rationale
again, but just present the design as it stands.  Damian will discuss
an extended example in his Exegesis 5, which will show the big picture
of how these various features work together to produce a much more
readable whole.</p>
<p>So anyway, here's what's new.</p>











<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>

<p>
<h3><a name="metacharacter reform">Metacharacter Reform</a></h3>
<p>Some things stay the same: <code>(...)</code> captures text just as it
did before, and the quantifiers <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>?</code> are also unchanged.
The vertical bar <code>|</code> still separates alternatives.  The backslash
<code>\</code> still protects the following character from its ordinary
interpretation.  The <code>?</code> suffix character still does minimal matching.
(Note that these are by far the most commonly used metacharacters, so many
ordinary regexes will look nearly identical in Perl 5 and Perl 6.)</p>
<p>Since <code>/x</code> extended syntax is now the default, <code>#</code> is now always
a metacharacter indicating a comment, and whitespace is now always
&quot;meta&quot;.  Whitespace is now the standard way to separate regex tokens that
would otherwise be confused as a single token.</p>
<p>Even in character classes, whitespace is not taken literally any more.
Backwhack the space if you mean it literally, or use <code>&lt;sp</code>&gt;, or <code>\040</code>, or
<code>\x20</code>, or <code>\c[SPACE]</code>.  But speaking of character classes...</p>
<p>Perhaps the most radical change is that I've taken <code>[...]</code> away from
character classes and made it the non-capturing grouping operator,
because grouping is more fundamental than character classes, and
explicit character classes are becoming less common than named
character classes.  (You can still do character classes, just not
with bare square brackets.)</p>
<p>I've also stolen <code>{...}</code> from generalized quantifiers and made them into
closure delimiters.  (Use <code>&lt;n,m&gt;</code> for the generalized quantifier now.)</p>
<p>I've stolen three new metacharacters.  The new extensible metasyntax
for assertions uses angle brackets, <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>.  And the
colon <code>:</code> is now used for declaration and backtracking control.
(Recall Larry's 2nd Law of Language Redesign: Larry gets the colon.)
The colon always introduces a token that controls the meaning of what
is around it.  The nature of the token depends on what follows
the colon.  Both the colon syntax and angle syntax are extensible.
(Backslash syntax is also extensible.)</p>
<p>This may sound like we're complexifying things, but we're really
simplifying.  We now have the following regex invariants:</p>
<pre>
    (...)       # always delimits a capturing group
    [...]       # always delimits a non-capturing group
    {...}       # always delimits a closure
    &lt;...&gt;       # always delimits an assertion
    :...        # always introduces a metasyntactic token</pre>
<p>(Note that we're using &quot;assertion&quot; here in the broad sense of
anything that either matches or fails, whether or not it has a width.)</p>
<p>The nature of the angle assertion is controlled by the first character
inside it.  If the first character is alphabetic, it's a grammatical
assertion, and the entire first word controls the meaning.  The word
is first looked up in the current grammar, if any.  If not found
there, it is checked to see if it is one of the built-in grammar
rules such as those defined by the Unicode property classes.  If the
first character is not alphabetic, there will be special rules
in the current grammar or in the Perl grammar for looking up the
parse rule.  For instance, by default, any assertion that begins with
<code>!</code> is simply negated.  Assertions that start with a digit are assumed
to be a range assertion (<code>&lt;n,m&gt;</code>) regarding the previous atom.
(Taking the last two together, you can say <code>&lt;!n,m&gt;</code> to exclude a range.)
Assertions that start with <code>$</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>%</code>, or <code>&amp;</code> are assumed to
interpolate an indirect regex rule stored in a variable or returned by
a subroutine.  An assertion that starts with a parenthesis is a closure being
used as an assertion.  An assertion that starts with a square bracket
or another angle bracket is a character class.  An assertion that
starts with a quote asserts the match of a literal string.  And so on.</p>
<p>Some metacharacters are still used but have a slightly different
meaning, in part to get rid of the <code>/s</code> and <code>/m</code> modifiers, and
in part because most strings in Perl 6 will come from the filehandle
pre-chomped.  So anchors <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> now always mean the <em>real</em> beginning
and ending of the string.  Use <code>^^</code> and <code>$$</code> to match the beginnings
and endings of lines <em>within</em> a string.  (They're doubled because
they're &quot;fancier&quot;, because they can match in multiple places, and
because they'll be rarer, so Huffman says they should be longer.)
The <code>^^</code> and <code>$$</code> also match where <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> would.</p>
<p>The dot <code>.</code> now always matches any character including newline.  (Use <code>\N</code>
to match a non-newline.  Or better, use an autochomping filehandle,
if you're processing line-by-line.)</p>
<p>In a sense, the sigils <code>$</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>%</code>, and <code>&amp;</code> are different metacharacters
because they don't interpolate, but are now subject to the interpretation
of the regex engine.  This allows us to change the default behavior of
ordinary &quot;interpolation&quot; to a literal match, and also lets us put in
lvalue-ish constructs like:</p>
<pre>
    / $name := (\S+) /
    / @kids := [(\S+) \s+]* /
    / %pets := [(\S+) \: (\S+) \s+]* /</pre>
<p>(Notice also the delicate interplay of quantified non-capturing
brackets with capturing parens, particularly for gathering multiple
values or even multiple key/value pairs.)</p>

<p>Declarations like <code>:i</code> are lexically scoped and do not pass to
any subrules.  Each rule maintains its own sensitivity.  There is no
built-in operator to turn case ignorance back off--just call a different rule and
it's automatically case sensitive again.  (If you want a parameterized
subrule, that can be arranged.  It's just a method, after all.  Proof of
this assertion is left to future generations of hackers.)</p>

<h3><a name="backslash reform">Backslash Reform</a></h3>
<p>There are some changes to backslash sequences.  Character properties
<code>\p</code> and <code>\P</code> are no longer needed--predefined character classes
are just considered intrinsic grammar rules.  (You can negate any <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>
assertion by using <code>&lt;!...&gt;</code> instead.)  As mentioned in
a previous Apocalypse, the <code>\L</code>, <code>\U</code>, and <code>\Q</code> sequences no longer
use <code>\E</code> to terminate--they now require bracketing characters of some
sort.  And <code>\Q</code> will rarely be needed due to regex policy changes.
In fact, they may all go away since it's easy to say things like:</p>
<pre>
    $(lc $foo)</pre>
<p>For any bracketing construct, square brackets are preferred,
but others are allowed:</p>
<pre>
    \x[...]     # preferred, indicates simple bracketing
    \x(...)     # okay, but doesn't capture.
    \x{...}     # okay, but isn't a closure.
    \x&lt;...&gt;     # okay, but isn't an assertion</pre>
<p>The <code>\c</code> sequence is now a bracketing construct, having been
extended from representing control characters to any named character.</p>
<p>Backreferences such as <code>\1</code> are gone in favor of the corresponding
variable <code>$1</code>.  <code>\A</code>, <code>\Z</code>, and <code>\z</code> are gone with the
disappearance of <code>/s</code> and <code>/m</code>.  The position assertion <code>\G</code> is
gone in favor of a <code>:c</code> modifier that forces continuation from where
the last match left off.  That's because <code>\G</code> was almost never used
except at the front of a regex.  In the unlikely event that you want to
assert that you're at the old final position elsewhere in your regex,
you can always test the current position (via the <code>.pos</code> method)
with an assertion:</p>
<pre>
    $oldpos = pos $string;
    $string =~ m/... &lt;( .pos == $oldpos )&gt; .../;</pre>
<p>You may be thinking of <code>.pos</code> as the final position of the previous
match, but that's not what it is.  It's the <em>current</em> position of the
current match.  It's just that, between matches, the current position
of the current match happens to be the same as the final position of
the current match, which happens to be the last match, which happens
to be done.  But as soon as you start another match, the last match is no
longer the current match.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>:c</code> continuation is needed only on constructs that
ordinarily force the search to start from the beginning.  Subrules
automatically continue at the current location, since their initial
position is controlled by some other rule.</p>
<p>There are two new backslash sequences, <code>\h</code> and <code>\v</code>, which match
horizontal and vertical whitespace respectively, including Unicode
spacing characters and control codes.  Note that <code>\r</code> is considered
vertical even though it theoretically moves the carriage sideways.
Finally, <code>\n</code> matches a logical newline, which is not necessarily
a linefeed character on all architectures.  After all, that's why it's an &quot;n&quot;,
not an &quot;l&quot;.  Your program should not break just because you happened to
run it on a file from a partition mounted from a Windows machine.
(Within an interpolated string, <code>\n</code> still produces whatever
is the normal newline for the current architecture.)</p>

<p>Under level 2 Unicode support, a character is assumed to mean a grapheme,
that is, a sequence consisting of a base character followed by 0 or more
combining characters.  That not only affects the meaning of the <code>.</code> character, but
also any negated character, since a negated character is really a negative
lookahead assertion followed by the traversal of a single character.  For
instance, <code>\N</code> really means:</p>
<pre>
    [&lt;!before \n&gt; . ]</pre>
<p>So it doesn't really matter how many characters <code>\n</code> actually matches.  <code>\N</code> always
matches a single character--whatever that is...</p>

<h3><a name="modifier reform">Modifier Reform</a></h3>
<p>You can't use colon for a regex delimiter any more.  That's because
regex modifiers may now be placed in front of a regex construct:</p>
<pre>
    s:w:i:e /foo/bar/           # :words :ignorecase :each</pre>
<p>That can also be written:</p>
<pre>
    s/:w:i:e foo/bar/           # :words :ignorecase :each</pre>
<p>Single character modifiers may be bundled like this:</p>
<pre>
    s:wie /foo/bar/             # :words :ignorecase :each</pre>
<p>...but only if the sequence as a whole is not already defined as
a long modifier, since ambiguity will be resolved in favor of
the long modifier. Long modifiers may <em>not</em> be bundled with any other
modifier.  So this is legal:</p>
<pre>
    s:once:wie /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>but not these (unless you've defined them):</p>
<pre>
    s:wieonce /foo/bar/
    s:oncewie /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>Not only is colon disallowed as a regex delimiter, but
you may no longer use parentheses as the delimiters either.
This will allow us to parameterize modifiers:</p>
<pre>
    s:myoption($x) /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>This rule also allows us to differentiate <code>s///</code> from an <code>s()</code> function,
<code>tr///</code> from <code>tr()</code>, etc.  If you want matching brackets for the
delimiters I'd suggest that you use square brackets, since they now
mean grouping without capturing.</p>
<p>Several modifiers, <code>/x</code>, <code>/s</code>, and <code>/m</code>, are no longer needed and have
been retired.  It's unclear whether <code>/o</code> is necessary any more.  We will
assume it's gone unless it's shown that caching can't handle the
problem.  Note that the regex now has more control over when to cache subrules
because it is no longer subject to the vagaries of standard interpolation.</p>
<p>The old <code>/c</code> modifier is gone because regexes never reset the position
on failure any more.  To do that, set <code>$string.pos = 0</code> explicitly.
But note also that assigning to a string automatically resets its position
to <code>0</code>, so any string in your typical loop is going to start with its current
search position already set <code>0</code>.  Modifying a string in place causes the position
to move to the end of the replacement section by default, if the position
was within the span replaced.  (This is consistent with <code>s///</code> semantics.)</p>
<p>The <code>/e</code> modifier is also gone, since it did reverse parsing magic, and
<code>:e</code> will be short for <code>:each</code>--see below.  It's still easy to substitute
the value of an expression though:</p>
<pre>
    s/pat/$( code )/;</pre>
<p>or even</p>
<pre>
    s(/pat/, { code });</pre>
<p>There's a new modifier, <code>:once</code>, that causes a match to succeed only
once (like the old <code>?...?</code> construct).  To reset it, use the <code>.reset</code>
method on the regex object.  (If you haven't named the regex object,
too bad...)</p>
<p>Another new modifier is <code>:w</code>, which causes an implicit match of
whitespace wherever there's literal whitespace in a pattern.
In other words, it replaces every sequence of actual whitespace
in the pattern with a <code>\s+</code> (between two identifiers) or a <code>\s*</code>
(between anything else). So
</p>
<pre>

    m:w/ foo bar \: ( baz )*/</pre>
<p>really means (expressed in Perl 5 form):
</p>
<pre>

    m:p5/\s*foo\s+bar\s*:(\s*baz\s*)*/</pre>
<p>You can still control the handling of whitespace under <code>:w</code>, since
we extend the rule to say that any explicit whitespace-matching token can't
match whitespace implicitly on either side. So:</p>
<pre>
    m:w/ foo\ bar \h* \: (baz)*/</pre>
<p>really means (expressed in Perl 5 form):
</p>
<pre>

    m:p5/\s*foo bar[\040\t\p{Zs}]*:\s*(baz)*/</pre>
<p>The first space in</p>
<pre>
    /[:w foo bar]/</pre>
<p>matches <code>\s*</code> before &quot;<code>foo</code>&quot;.  That's usually what you want, but if
it's not what you want, you have a little problem.  Unfortunately you
can't just say:</p>
<pre>
    /[:wfoo bar]/</pre>
<p>That won't work because it'll look for the <code>:wfoo</code> modifier.
However, there are several ways to get the effect you want:</p>
<pre>
    /[:w()foo bar]/ 
    /[:w[]foo bar]/ 
    /[:w\bfoo bar]/ 
    /[:w::foo bar]/</pre>
<p>That last one is just our friend the <code>::</code> operator in disguise.
If you backtrack into it, you're leaving the brackets anyway, so it's
essentially a no-op.</p>
<p>The new <code>:c</code>/<code>:cont</code> modifier forces the regex to continue
at the current &quot;pos&quot; of the string.  It may only be used outside
the regex. (Well, it could be used inside but it'd be redundant.)
The modifier also forces the regex to match only the next available
thing.  That's not quite the same as the <code>^</code> anchor, though,
because it not only disables the implicit scanning done by <code>m//</code>
and <code>s///</code>, but it also works on more than the first iteration.
It forces all matches to be contiguous, in other words.  So <code>:c</code>
is short for both &quot;continue&quot; and &quot;contiguous&quot;.  If you say</p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;foofoofoo foofoofoo&quot;;
    s:each:cont/foo/FOO/;</pre>
<p>you get:</p>
<pre>
    FOOFOOFOO foofoofoo</pre>
<p>This may seem odd, but it's precisely the semantics of any
embedded regex:</p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;foofoofoo foofoofoo&quot;;
    $rx = rx/foo/;
    m/&lt;$rx&gt;*/;          # matches &quot;foofoofoo&quot;</pre>
<p>A modifier that starts with a number causes the pattern to match that
many times.  It may only be used outside the regex.  It may not be
bundled, because ordinals are distinguished from cardinals.  That is,
how it treats those multiple matches depends on the next character.
If you say</p>
<pre>
    s:3x /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>then it changes the first 3 instances.  But if you say</p>
<pre>
    s:3rd /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>it changes only the 3rd instance.  You can say</p>
<pre>
    s:1st /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>but that's just the default, and should not be construed
as equivalent to <code>:once</code>, which matches only once, ever.
(Unless you <code>.reset</code> it, of course.)</p>
<p>You can combine cardinals and ordinals:</p>
<pre>
    s:3x:3rd /foo/bar/</pre>
<p>That changes the 3rd, 6th, and 9th occurrences.  To change every other
quote character, say</p>
<pre>
    s:each:2nd /&quot;/\&amp;rquot;/;</pre>
<p><code>:each</code> is synonymous with <code>:3x</code> (for large values of <code>3</code>).  Note that
<code>:each</code> does not, in fact, generate every possible match, because it
disallows overlaps.  To get every possible match, use the <code>:any</code>
modifier.  Saying:</p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;abracadabra&quot;;
    @all = m:any /a[^a]+a/;</pre>
<p>produces:</p>
<pre>
    abra aca ada abra</pre>
<p>It can even match multiple times at the same spot as long as the
rest of the regex progresses somehow.  Saying:</p>
<pre>
    @all = m:any /a.*?a/;</pre>
<p>produces:</p>
<pre>
    abra abraca abracada abracadabra aca acada acadabra ada adabra abra</pre>
<p>If you say</p>
<pre>
    $sentence.m:any /^ &lt;english&gt; $/</pre>
<p>you'll get every possible parsing of the sentence according to the rules
of <code>english</code> (not to be confused with the rules of English, which are already
confusing enough, except when they aren't).</p>
<p>To indicate varying levels of Unicode support we have these modifiers, which may
be used either inside or outside a regex:</p>
<pre>
    :u0         # use bytes       (. is byte)
    :u1         # level 1 support (. is codepoint)
    :u2         # level 1 support (. is grapheme)
    :u3         # level 1 support (. is language dependent)</pre>
<p>These modifiers say nothing about the state of the data, but in general internal
Perl data will already be in Normalization Form C, so even under <code>:u1</code>, the precomposed
characters will usually do the right thing.  Note that these modifiers
are for overriding the default support level, which was probably set by pragma
at the top of the file.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the <code>:p5</code> modifier, which causes the rest of the regex (or group) to
be parsed as a Perl 5 regular expression, including any interpolated strings.
(But it still doesn't enable Perl 5's trailing modifiers.)</p>

<h3><a name="keyword and context reform">Keyword and Context Reform</a></h3>
<p>Deferred regex rules are now defined with <code>rx//</code> rather than <code>qr//</code>,
because a regular expression is no longer a kind of quoted string.</p>
<p>Actually, just as you can define closures without an explicit <code>sub</code>,
any <code>//</code> or <code>rx//</code> declares a deferred regex if it's not in a context
that executes it immediately.  A regex is executed automatically if
it's in a boolean, numeric, or string context.  But assignment to
an untyped variable is not such a context, nor is passing the regex
as an untyped parameter to a function.  (Of course, an explicitly
declared RULE parameter doesn't provide an evaluating context either.)</p>
<p>So these are equivalent:</p>
<pre>
    my $foo = /.../;            # create regex object
    my $foo = rx[...];          # create regex object
    my $foo = rule {...};       # create regex object</pre>
<p>Likewise, these are equivalent:</p>
<pre>
    @x = split /.../;
    @x = split rx[...];
    @x = split rule {...};</pre>
<p>The &quot;rule&quot; syntax is just a way of declaring a deferred regex as if it were a subroutine
or method.  More on that later.</p>
<p>To force an immediate evaluation of a deferred regex where it wouldn't ordinarily
be, you can use the appropriate unary operator:</p>
<pre>
    my $foo = ?/.../;   # boolean context, return whether matched, 
    my $foo = +/.../;   # numeric context, return count of matches
    my $foo = _/.../;   # string context, return captured/matched string</pre>
<p>The standard match and substitution forms also force immediate evaluation
regardless of context:</p>
<pre>
    $result = m/.../;           # do match on topic string
    $result = s/.../.../;       # do substitution on topic string</pre>
<p>These forms also force the regex to start matching at the beginning
of the string in question and scan forward through the string for
the match, as if there were an implicit <code>.*?</code> in front of every
iteration.  (Both of these behaviors are suppressed if you use
the <code>:c</code>/<code>:cont</code> modifier).  In contrast, the meaning of the
deferred forms is dependent on context.  In particular, a deferred
regex naturally assumes <code>:c</code> when used as a subrule.  That is,
it continues where the last match left off, and the next thing has
to match right there at the head of the string.</p>
<p>In any other context, including list context, a deferred regex is <em>not</em> immediately evaluated,
but produces a reference to the regex object:</p>
<pre>
    my $rx = /.../;     # not evaluated
    my @foo = $rx;      # ERROR: type mismatch.
    my @foo = ($rx);    # One element, a regex object.
    my @foo = (/.../);  # Same thing.
    my @foo := $rx;     # Set autogrow rule for @foo.</pre>
<p>To evaluate repeatedly in list context, treat the regex object as you would any other iterator:</p>
<pre>
    my @foo = &lt;$rx&gt;;</pre>
<p>You can also use the more explicit form:</p>
<pre>
    my @foo = m/&lt;$rx&gt;/;</pre>
<p>Those aren't identical, since the former assumes <code>:c</code> and starts up at the current
position of the unmentioned topic, while the latter explicitly resets
the position to the beginning before scanning.  Also, since the deferred
regex assumes a <code>:c</code> modifier, <code>&lt;$rx&gt;</code> won't scan through the string
like <code>m//</code>.  It can return multiple values to the list, but they
have to be contiguous.  You can get the scanning effect of <code>m//</code>
by prepending the pattern with <code>.*?</code>.</p>
<p>But it's vitally important to understand this fundamental change, that
<code>//</code> is no longer a short form of <code>m//</code>, but rather a short form of <code>rx//</code>.
If you want to add modifiers to a <code>//</code>, you have to turn it into an <code>rx//</code>, not
an <code>m//</code>.  It's now <em>wrong</em> to call <code>split</code> like this:</p>
<pre>
    split m/.../</pre>
<p>(That is, it's wrong unless you actually want the return value of the
pattern match to be used as the literal split delimiter.)</p>
<p>The old <code>?...?</code> syntax is gone.  Indeed, it has to go for us to get
the unary <code>?</code> operator.</p>

<h3><a name="null string reform">Null String Reform</a></h3>
<p>The null pattern is now illegal.  To match whatever you used to match
with a null pattern, use one of these:</p>
<pre>
    Old                 New
    ---                 ---
    //                  /&lt;prior&gt;/       # match what prior match did
    //                  /&lt;null&gt;/        # match the null string between chars
    (a|b|)              (a|b|&lt;null&gt;)    # match a null alternative</pre>
<p>Note that, as an assertion, &lt;null&gt; always succeeds.  You never want to say:</p>
<pre>
    / &lt;null&gt; | single | double | triple | home run /</pre>
<p>because you'll never get to first base.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="extension syntax reform">Extension Syntax Reform</a></h3>
<p>There are no longer any <code>(?...)</code> sequences, because parens now always
capture.  Some of the replacement sequences take their intrinsic
scoping from <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>, while others are associated with other
bracketing characters, or with any arbitrary atom that could be a
bracketed construct.  Looking at the metasyntax problem from the
perspective of a Perl5-to-Perl6 translator, here's what the various
Perl 5 extension constructs translate to:</p>
<pre>
    Old                 New
    ---                 ---
    (??{$rule})         &lt;$rule&gt;         # call regex in variable
    (?{ code })         { code }        # call Perl code, ignore result
    (?#...)             &lt;('...')&gt;       # in-line comment, rarely needed
    (?:...)             [...]           # non-capturing brackets
    (?=...)             &lt;before ...&gt;    # positive lookahead
    (?!...)             &lt;!before ...&gt;   # negative lookahead
    (?&lt;=...)            &lt;after ...&gt;     # positive lookbehind
    (?&lt;!...)            &lt;!after ...&gt;    # negative lookbehind
    (?&gt;...)             [...]:          # grab (any atom)</pre>
<pre>
    (?(cond)yes|no)     [ cond :: yes | no ]
    (?(1)yes|no)        [ &lt;(defined $1)&gt; :: yes | no ]</pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;$rule&gt;</code> construct does a &quot;delayed&quot; call of another
regular expression stored in the <code>$rule</code> variable.  If it is
a regex object, it's just called as if it were a subroutine,
so there's no performance problem.  If it's a string, it is
compiled as a regex and executed.  The compiled form is cached
as a property of the string, so it doesn't have to be recompiled
unless the string changes.  (This implies that we can have properties
that invalidate themselves when their base object is modified.)
In either case, the evaluated regex is treated as a subrule, and
any captures it does are invisible to the outer regex unless the
outer regex takes steps to retrieve them.  In any event, subrule
parens never change the paren count of the outer rule.</p>
<p>The <code>{code}</code> form doesn't return anything meaningful--it is used for
its side effects.  Any such closure may behave as an assertion.  It merely
has to throw an exception in order to fail.  To throw such an exception
(on purpose) one may use <code>fail</code>:</p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;666&quot;;
    / (\d+) { $1 &lt; 582 or fail }/</pre>
<p>As with any assertion, the failing closure starts backtracking at the
location of the closure.  In this case, it backtracks into the <code>\d+</code>
and ends up matching &quot;<code>66</code>&quot; rather than &quot;<code>666</code>&quot;.  If you didn't
want that, use <code>\d+:</code> instead.</p>
<p>It's more succinct, however, to use the code assertion syntax.  Just put
angles around a parenthesized Perl expression:</p>
<pre>
    / (\d+) &lt;( $1 &lt; 582 )&gt; /</pre>
<p>I find the parens to be vaguely reminiscent of the parentheses you
have to put around conditionals in C (but not Perl (anymore)).  Also,
the parentheses are meant to remind you that you only want to put an
expression there, not a full statement.</p>
<p>Don't use a bare closure to try to interpolate a calculated regex, since the
result will be ignored.  Instead, use the <code>&lt;{expr}&gt;</code> form to do that.
As with <code>&lt;&amp;rule()&gt;</code>, the result will be interpreted as a subrule, not as
if it were interpolated.</p>
<p>Since a string is usually true, you can just assert it to get the effect of
an inline comment: <code>&lt;(&quot;this is a comment&quot;)&gt;</code>.  But I've never used one
except to show it as an example.  Line ending comments are usually much
clearer.  (Just bear in mind you can't put the final regex delimiter on the
same line, because it won't be seen in the comment.)  You could also use
the <code>{'...'}</code> construct for comments, but then you risk warnings about
&quot;useless use of a string in void context&quot;.</p>
<p>The <code>[...]</code> is the new non-capturing bracket notation.  It seems to work
very well for this purpose--I tried the other brackets and they tend
to &quot;disappear&quot; faster than square brackets.  So we reserve <code>(...)</code> and
<code>&lt;...&gt;</code> for constructs where the visual distance between opening and closing is
typically shorter than for square brackets or curlies.  The square brackets also work
nicely when lined up vertically with vertical bars.  Here's a declaration
of a named rule from the class Perl6Grammar.  It parses Perl 6 statements.
(Think of it as a funny looking method declaration.)</p>
<pre>
    rule state  { &lt;label&gt;
                    [ &lt;control&gt;          {.control}
                    | &lt;sideff&gt; &lt;eostate&gt; {.sideff}
                    | &lt;@other_statements&gt;
                    ]
                };</pre>
<p>Huffman coding says that rarer forms should be longer, and that's the
case with the lookahead and lookbehind assertions, <code>&lt;before ...&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;after ...&gt;</code>.  (The negations are formed via the general
<code>&lt;!...&gt;</code> rule.)  Note that these prepositions are interpreted
as assertions, not operations.  For example, <code>&lt;before X&gt;</code> is
to be read &quot;Assert that we are before X&quot; rather than &quot;Look before
where we are for X&quot;.</p>











<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>

<p>The new <code>:</code> operator replaces the <code>(?&gt;...)</code> construct.  It modifies
whatever comes before it, much like <code>*</code> does, so it's naturally scoped
if the preceding atom (or quantified atom) is a bracketed construct.
Parsers can use this every time they commit to the parsing of a token
or phrase to tell the regex engine that there's no point in backtracking
through the atom in question, so backtracking will skip backwards over
the atom and continue with some earlier branch point.  The following takes
a long time to fail if it has to look at every sequence of &quot;<code>a</code>&quot; to see if
there is a &quot;<code>b</code>&quot; after it:</p>
<pre>
    &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac&quot; =~ /^ a* b /</pre>
<p>But we already know that the only possible match is the longest one.
So if you put in the colon, it fails in one pass because the <code>*</code> grabs everything
and gives nothing back on backtracking.</p>
<pre>
    &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac&quot; =~ /^ a*: b /</pre>
<p>You can use colon on a longer sequence too.  The following might match a list of
expressions separated by comma:</p>
<pre>
    / &lt;expr&gt; [ , &lt;expr&gt; ]*: /</pre>
<p>It is an error to use <code>:</code> on any atom that does no backtracking.  This will
help to catch errors where you've forgotten to backslash a literal colon in
things like:</p>
<pre>
    /^From: (.*)/</pre>
<p>Perl 6 has no need for a special conditional construct like Perl 5's <code>(?(cond)yes|no)</code>. 
That's because with a slight tweak, ordinary alternation can do the same thing.
That tweak is our next backtracking modifier, the <code>::</code> operator.  If you backtrack
across it, it fails all the way out of the current list of alternatives.  Consider
an ordinary list of alternatives:</p>
<pre>
    [ &lt;A&gt; &lt;X&gt; | &lt;B&gt; &lt;Y&gt; | &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt; ]</pre>
<p>The way the rules of backtracking work, if either <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;X&gt;</code>
 fail, it backtracks to the next alternative.  Likewise for
<code>&lt;B&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code>.  In the case of <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Z&gt;</code>,
 there is no next alternative, so it naturally fails out of the
entire construct.  That's not how a conditional is supposed to work,
because in the conditional, only the condition determines which case
is executed.  Once you've committed to a particular case, it has to
stand or fall as if the conditional hadn't been there.  So all we
need for our purposes is to have is something that separates the
assertions that matter from those that don't.  That's what <code>::</code>
does, and it reads rather well as a &quot;then&quot;, or as a &quot;corresponds to&quot;.  If you write</p>
<pre>
    [ &lt;A&gt; :: &lt;X&gt;
    | &lt;B&gt; :: &lt;Y&gt;
    | &lt;C&gt; :: &lt;Z&gt;
    ]</pre>
<p>then the failure of <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;B&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> proceeds
to the next case (if any), while any failure in <code>&lt;X&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code>,
or <code>&lt;Z&gt;</code> is guaranteed to backtrack out of the front of the
alternative list and revise a former choice (just as the success of
<code>&lt;X&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;Z&gt;</code> is guaranteed to &quot;forward track&quot;
out of the end of the alternative list and try to match more).  It's a
natural mapping to existing regex semantics.  Here's a more realistic
example from the Perl 6 grammar.  It parses statement modifiers.
(The <code>&lt;ws&gt;</code> rule parses optional whitespace.)</p>
<pre>
    rule modifier { if     &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_cond(0,$expr) }
                  | unless &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_cond(1,$expr) }
                  | while  &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_loop(0,$expr) }
                  | until  &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_loop(1,$expr) }
                  | for    &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_for($expr)   }
                  | &lt;@other_modifiers&gt;  # user defined
                  | &lt;null&gt;              # no modifier
                  }</pre>
<p>In each case, once we recognize a keyword (and its following
whitespace), we need to look for an expression, and then call a closure
that builds the syntax tree.  If either of those fails, the entire
modifier rule fails.  We only get to the last two alternatives on
failure of assertions before the <code>::</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>::</code> only says that we can't backtrack from the &quot;then&quot;
into the &quot;if&quot;.  It says nothing about backtracking into the alternative
list as a whole.  The alternatives are still choice points, so the
regex engine is allowed to backtrack into the alternative list and
try another alternative.  (To disable that, simply put a <code>:</code> after
the closing bracket of the alternative list.)</p>
<p>There is nothing in Perl 5 corresponding to the <code>:::</code> operator, but
it works just like <code>::</code>, only more so.  If you backtrack across it,
it fails all the way out of the current rule definition (though not
out of any rule invoking this definition).  That is, it fails all the
way out of the innermost lexically enclosing <code>/.../</code>, <code>m/.../</code>, <code>s/...//</code>,
<code>rx/.../</code>, or <code>rule {...}</code>, skipping out through any enclosing
nestings of <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>, <code>[...]</code>, or <code>(...)</code>.  (A pattern nested
within a closure is classified as its own rule, however, so it never gets
the chance to pass out of a <code>{...}</code> closure.)</p>
<p>Since the alternatives in our last example are at the top level of the
regex, we could have used the <code>:::</code> operator to get the same effect
as <code>::</code>, because terminating the rule and terminating the alternation
amount to the same thing in that case.  You can think of all of these
as variants on Prolog's &quot;cut&quot; operator.</p>
<p>If you backtrack over the <code>::::</code> operator, it will delete your program
from the disk.  <code>;-)</code></p>
<p>Actually, the real name of the real <code>::::</code> operator is <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>.
It fails the entire match if you backtrack over it, not just the
current rule.  That is, it fails all the way out of the <em>outermost</em>
dynamically enclosing <code>/.../</code>, <code>m/.../</code>, <code>s/...//</code>, <code>rx/.../</code>,
or <code>rule {...}</code> that is executing on the current string.</p>
<p>There is one &quot;cut&quot; operator that is beyond <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>; it is
appropriately named <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code>, for two reasons.  First of all, it's
a real cut operator in that, if you backtrack over it, the current
match fails completely, just like <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>.  But that's
just a side effect of the other reason, which is that <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code>
cuts off the front of the string that you're currently matching on,
turning the current position into the new beginning of the string.
When you're matching on a potentially infinite string, it's important
that you have a way of discarding that part of the match that you've
already committed to.  In Perl 5, the only way to do that was with
a coordinated system of <code>s/^pat//</code> operations.  With the <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code>
assertion, however, you can just match normally, and cut at one
spot in your top-level rule when you reach an &quot;accept&quot; state.</p>
<p>In the realm of idle speculation, we could go as far as to define a
variant of <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code> that would render <code>s///</code> slightly redundant:</p>
<pre>
    s/foo/bar/;
    m/foo &lt;replace(&quot;bar&quot;)&gt; /</pre>
<p>Note that we don't need any special forms for controlling the scope of
a &quot;fail&quot; in a closure.  Just prefix the closure with the appropriate
backtracking operator:</p>
<pre>
    / pattern ::: { code() or fail } /  # fails entire rule</pre>

<h3><a name="character class reform">Character Class Reform</a></h3>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, character classes are becoming more like standard
grammar rules, because the definition of &quot;character&quot; is getting fuzzier.
This is part of the motivation for demoting enumerated character classes
and stealing the square brackets for another purpose.  Actually, for old
times' sake you still use square brackets on enumerated character classes,
but you have to put an extra set of angles around it.  But this actually
tends to save keystrokes when you want to use any named character classes or
Unicode properties, particularly when you want to combine them:</p>
<pre>
    Old                 New
    ---                 ---
    [a-z]               &lt;[a-z]&gt;
    [[:alpha:]]         &lt;alpha&gt;
    [^[:alpha:]]        &lt;-alpha&gt;
    [[:alpha:][:digit]] &lt;&lt;alpha&gt;&lt;digit&gt;&gt;</pre>
<p>The outer <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> also naturally serves as a container for any
extra syntax we decide to come up with for character set manipulation:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;[_]+&lt;alpha&gt;+&lt;digit&gt;-&lt;Swedish&gt;&gt;</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="state">State</a></h3>
<p>[This section gets pretty abstruse.  It's okay if your eyes glaze over.]</p>
<p>Every regex match maintains a state object, and any closure within the
regex is actually an anonymous method of that object, which means
in turn that the closure's topic is the current state object.  Since a
unary dot introduces a method call on the current topic, it follows
that you can call any method in the state object that way:</p>
<pre>
    /(.*) { print .pos }/       # print current position</pre>
<p>The state object may in fact be an instance of a grammar class.  A grammar
object has additional methods that know how to build a parse tree.
Its rules also know how to refer to each other or to rules of related
grammars.</p>
<p>Note that <code>$_</code> within the closure refers to this state object, not the
original search string.  If you search on the state object, however, it
pretends that you wanted to continue the search on the original string.
If the internal search succeeds, the position of the external state is
updated as well, just as if the internal search had been a rule invoked
directly from the outer regex.</p>
<p>Because the state object is aware of how the tree is being built,
when backtracking occurs the object can destroy parts of the parse tree
that were conjectured in error.  Because the grammar's action methods
have control of the regex state, they can access named fields in
the regex without having to explicitly pass them to the method call.</p>
<p>For instance, in our earlier example we passed <code>$expr</code> explicitly
to build the parse tree, but the method can actually figure that
out itself.  So we could have just written:</p>
<pre>
    rule modifier { if     &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_cond(0) }
                  | unless &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_cond(1) }
                  | while  &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_loop(0) }
                  | until  &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_loop(1) }
                  | for    &lt;ws&gt; :: &lt;expr&gt; { .new_for }
                  | &lt;@other_modifiers&gt;  # user defined
                  | &lt;null&gt;              # no modifier
                  },</pre>
<p>See Variable Scoping below for where <code>@other_modifiers</code> gets looked up.</p>
<p>Within a closure, <code>$_</code> represents the current state of the current
regex, and by extension, the current state of all the regexes
participating in the current match.  (The type of the state object
is the current grammar class, which may be an anonymous type if
the current grammar has no name.  If the regex is not a member of a
grammar, it's of type RULE.)  Part of the state of the current regex
is the current node of the parse tree that is being built.  When the
current regex succeeds, the state object becomes a result object,
and is returned to the calling regex.  The calling regex can refer to the
returned object as a &quot;hypothetical&quot; variable, the name of which is either
implicitly generated from the name of the rule, or explicitly bound
using <code>:=</code>.  Through that variable you can get at anything captured
by the subrule.  (That is what <code>$expr</code> was doing earlier.)</p>
<p>When the entire match succeeds, the top-level node is returned as a
result object that has various values in various contexts, whether
boolean, numeric, or string context.  The name of the result object
is <code>$0</code>.  The result object contains all the other information, such
as <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc.  Unlike <code>$&amp;</code> in Perl 5, <code>$0</code> is lexically scoped
to the enclosing block.  By extension, <code>$1</code>, etc. are also lexically
scoped.</p>
<p>As a kind of iterator, a regex stored in a variable doesn't expand
in list context unless you put angles around it or use it with <code>m//</code>:</p>
<pre>
    $rx = /(xxx)/;
    print 1,2,&lt;$rx($_)&gt;;</pre>
<pre>
    print 1,2,&lt;/(xxx)/&gt;;</pre>
<pre>
    my &amp;rx := /(xxx)/;
    print 1,2,&lt;rx($_)&gt;;</pre>
<p><code>$0</code>, <code>$1</code>, etc. are not set in iterated cases like this.  Each list
item is a result object, though, and you can still get at the
internal values that way.</p>

<p>
<h3><a name="hypothetical variables, er values">Hypothetical Variables, er Values</a></h3>
<p>Values that are determined within a regular expression should usually
be viewed as speculative, subject to cancellation if backtracking
occurs.  This applies not only to the values captured by <code>(...)</code>
within the regex, but also to values determined within closures
embedded in the regex.  The scope of these values is rather strange,
compared to ordinary variables.  They are dynamically scoped, but
not like <code>temp</code> variables.  A temporary variable is restored at
the end of the current block.  A hypothetical variable keeps its
value after the current block exits, and in fact keeps that value
clear to the end of its natural lifetime if the regex succeeds
(where the natural lifetime depends on where it's declared).
But if failure causes backtracking over where the variable was set,
then it is restored to its previous state.  Perl 5 actually coerced
the <code>local</code> operator into supporting this behavior, but that was
a mistake.  In Perl 6 <code>temp</code> will keep consistent semantics, and
restore values on exit from the current block.  A new word, <code>let</code>,
will indicate the desire to set a variable to a hypothetical value.
(I was tempted to use &quot;suppose&quot;, but &quot;let&quot; is shorter, and tends to
mean the same thing, at least to mathematicians.)</p>
<pre>
    my $x;
    / (\S*) { let $x = .pos } \s* foo /</pre>
<p>After this pattern, <code>$x</code> will be set to the ending position of <code>$1</code>--but only
if the pattern succeeds.  If it fails, <code>$x</code> is restored to <code>undef</code> when the closure
is backtracked.  It's possible to do things in a closure that the regex
engine doesn't know how to backtrack, of course, but a hypothetical
value doesn't fall into that category.  For things that do fall into
that category, perhaps we need to define a <code>BACK</code> block that is like
<code>UNDO</code>, but scoped to backtracking.</p>
<p>Sometimes we'll talk about declaring a hypothetical variable, but as with
<code>temp</code> variables, we're not actually declaring the variable itself, but the
dynamic scope of its new value.  In Perl 6, you can in fact say:</p>
<pre>
    my $x = 0;
    ...
    {
        temp $x = 1;    # temporizes the lexical variable
        ...
    }
    # $x restored to 0</pre>
<p>(This is primarily useful for dynamically scoping a file-scoped lexical, which
is slightly safer than temporizing a package variable since nobody can see
it outside the file.)</p>
<p>You may declare a hypothetical variable only when the topic is a regex state.
This is not as much of a hardship as it might seem.  Suppose your closure
calls out to some other routine, and passes the regex state as an argument, <code>$rx_state</code>.
It suffices to say:</p>
<pre>
    given $rx_state { let $x = .pos }</pre>
<p>As it happens, <code>$1</code> and friends are all simply hypothetical variables.
When we say &quot;hypothetical variable&quot;, we aren't speaking of where the
variable is stored, but rather how its contents are treated dynamically.
If a regex sets a hypothetical variable that was declared with either
<code>my</code> or <code>our</code> beforehand, then the regex modifies that lexical or
package variable, and <code>let</code> is purely a run-time operation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the variable is not pre-declared, it's actually
stored in the regex state object.  In this case, the <code>let</code> also serves
to declare the variable as lexically scoped to the rest of the regex,
in addition to its run-time action.  Such a variable is not directly
visible outside the regex, but you can get at it through the <code>$0</code> object
(always presuming the match succeeded).  For a regex variable named
<code>$maybe</code>, its external name is <code>$0._var_{'maybe'}</code>.  The <code>$0</code> object
can behave as a hash, so <code>$0{maybe}</code> is the short way to say that.</p>
<p>All other variable names are stored with their sigil, so the
external name for <code>@maybe</code> is <code>$0{'@maybe'}</code>, and for <code>%maybe</code>
is <code>$0{'%maybe'}</code>.</p>
<p><code>$1</code> is a special case--it's visible outside the regex, not because
it's predeclared, but because Perl already knows that the numbered variable
<code>$1</code> is really stored as a subarray of the $0 object: <code>$0[1]</code>.  The
numbered variables are available only through the array, not the hash.</p>
<p>Since <code>$0</code> represents the state of the currently executing regex,
you can't use it within a rule to get at the result of a completed
subrule.  When you successfully call a subrule named <code>&lt;somerule&gt;</code>,
the regex state is automatically placed in a hypothetical variable
named <code>$somerule</code>.  (Rules accessed indirectly must be captured
explicitly, or they won't have a name by which you can get to them.
More on that in the next section.)</p>
<p>As the current recursive regex executes, it automatically builds a
tree of hashes corresponding to all captured hypothetical variables.
So from outside the regex, you could get at the <code>$1</code> of the subrule
<code>&lt;somerule&gt;</code> by saying <code>$0{somerule}[1]</code>.</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="named captures">Named Captures</a></h3>
<p>Suppose you want to use a hypothetical variable to bind a name to a capture:</p>
<pre>
    / (\S+) { let $x := $1 } /</pre>
<p>A shorthand for that is:</p>
<pre>
    / $x:=(\S+) /</pre>
<p>The parens are numbered independently of any name, so <code>$x</code> is an alias for <code>$1</code>.</p>
<p>You may also use arrays to capture appropriately quantified patterns:</p>
<pre>
    / @x := (\S+ \s*)* /                # including space
    / @x := [ (\S+) \s* ]* /            # excluding space
    / @x := [ (\S+) (\s*) ]* /          # each element is [word, space]</pre>
<p>Note that in general, naming square brackets doesn't cause the square
brackets to capture, but rather provides a destination for the parens
within the square brackets.  Only parens and rules can capture.  It's
illegal to name square brackets that don't capture something inside.</p>
<p>You can also capture to a hash:</p>
<pre>
    / %x := [ (\S+)\: \s* (.*) ]* /     # key/value pairs</pre>
<p>After that match, <code>$1</code> returns a list of keys, and <code>$2</code> returns a list of values.
You can capture just the keys:</p>
<pre>
    / %x := [ (\S+) \s* ]* /            # just enter keys, values are undef</pre>
<p>You can capture a closure's return value too:</p>
<pre>
    / $x := { &quot;I'm in scalar context&quot; } /
    / @x := { &quot;I&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;context&quot; } /
    / %x := { &quot;I&quot; =&gt; &quot;am in hash context&quot; } /</pre>
<p>Note that these do not use parens.  If you say:</p>
<pre>
    / $x := ({ code }) /</pre>
<p>it would capture whatever text was traversed by the closure, but ignore
the closure's actual return value.</p>
<p>You can reorder paren groups by naming them with numeric variables:</p>
<pre>
    / $2:=(.*?), \h* $1:=(.*) /</pre>
<p>If you use a numeric variable, the numeric variables will start
renumbering from that point, so subsequent captures can be of a
known number (which clobbers any previous association with that number).
So for instance you can reset the numbers for each alternative:</p>
<pre>
    / $1 := (.*?) (\:)  (.*) { process $1, $2, $3 }
    | $1 := (.*?) (=\&gt;) (.*) { process $1, $2, $3 }
    | $1 := (.*?) (-\&gt;) (.*) { process $1, $2, $3 }
    /</pre>
	










<p><em>Editor's Note: this Apocalypse is out of date and remains here for historic reasons.  See <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Synopsis 05</a> for the latest information.</em></p>

<p>It's also possible to refer to captures relative to the current
location.  <code>$-1</code> refers to the immediately preceding capture (what
used to be known as <code>$+</code>).  <code>$-2</code> refers to the one before that.
If you use anything above <code>$-3</code> we'll come and take you away to the
insane asylum.</p>
<p>Subrules called via <code>&lt;rule&gt;</code> also capture their result in
hypothetical variables.  It's possible to name the results of any
<code>&lt;...&gt;</code>, but grammar rules already have a name by default, so
you don't have to give them names unless you call the same rule more
than once.  So, presuming you have grammar rules defining &quot;key&quot; and
&quot;value&quot;, you can say:</p>
<pre>
    / &lt;key&gt; \: &lt;value&gt; { let %hash{$key} = $value } /</pre>
<p>Of course, in a typical grammar the typical rule may not return a
string, but a reference to an anonymous object representing a node
of the parse tree.  But that depends on what the subrule decides
to capture.  If the only thing captured in the subrule is a single
string, that's what you get.  (If nothing is captured, you get the
entire match.)</p>
<p>Any capture that will capture multiple items will, if asked to put
it into a scalar variable, produce an anonymous list automatically.
This should rarely be a surprise, since it's obvious by inspection
whether you've quantified the capture or not.  So if you say any of:</p>
<pre>
    / $x := &lt;word&gt;*/
    / $x := &lt;word&gt;+/
    / $x := &lt;word&gt;&lt;1,3&gt;/</pre>
<p>then you've &quot;pluralized&quot; the naming, and you can expect to get some
number of values in <code>$x</code> as an anonymous list.  However, the <code>?</code>
quantifier specifically doesn't pluralize.  If you say:</p>
<pre>
    / $x := &lt;word&gt;?/</pre>
<p>then <code>$x</code> will either be the result of the subrule or <code>undef</code>.</p>
<p>You can name the results of a zero-width assertion, but you'd typically
only get the null string out of it.  This can still be useful, since it
contrasts with the undefined value you'd have if the assertion fails.
(It is possible with an explicit capture to return a non-zero-width
string from a zero-width assertion, however.)</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="variable scoping">Variable Scoping</a></h3>
<p>When you refer to a variable <code>@foo</code> as an rvalue in a regex, it
searches for an existing variable in the following places:</p>
<ol>
<li>
We first look to see if the variable is already declared lexically
with either <code>my @foo</code> or <code>our @foo</code>.  If so declared, we're done.
<p></p>
<li>
Next we look for <code>@foo</code> in the current regex's name table.  The name
of the variable is really <code>$0{'@foo'}</code>.
<p></p>
<li>
If the regex belongs to a grammar, we next look for <code>@foo</code>
in the grammar object.  If there, its real name is
<code>@.foo</code>, or some such.  (It might be objected that
the grammar object is not yet constructed when the regex is compiled.
After all, the regex is probably being passed to the grammar object's
constructor.  But I think if such a variable is declared as an object
attribute we know that there <em>will</em> be such a variable/accessor later
when we have finished constructing, and that seems like enough info
to know how to compile the regex.)
<p></p>
<li>
Next we look for <code>@foo</code> as a declared core global variable <code>@*foo</code>.
<p></p>
<li>
Finally, if &quot;strict vars&quot; is not in effect, we assume that <code>@foo</code>
is stored in the current package.  Otherwise it's a stricture error.
<p></p></ol>

<p>
<h3><a name="variable interpretation">Variable Interpretation</a></h3>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, bare scalars match their contents literally.
(Use <code>&lt;$var&gt;</code> instead to match a regex defined in <code>$var</code>.)
Subscripted arrays and hashes behave just like a scalar as long
as the subscripts aren't slices.</p>
<p>If you use a bare array (unsubscripted), it will
match if <em>any</em> element of the array matches literally at that point.
(A slice of an array or hash also behaves this way.)
If you say</p>
<pre>
    @array = (&quot;^&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;.&quot;);
    / @array /</pre>
<p>it's as if you said</p>
<pre>
    / \^ | \$ | \. /</pre>
<p>But if you you slice it like this:</p>
<pre>
    / @array[0..1] /</pre>
<p>it won't match the dot.</p>
<p>If you want the array to be considered as a set of regex alternatives, enclose in
angles:</p>
<pre>
    @array = (&quot;^foo$&quot;, &quot;^bar$&quot;, &quot;^baz$&quot;);
    / &lt;@array&gt; /</pre>
<p>Bare hashes in a regex provide a sophisticated match-via-lookup mechanism.
Bare hashes are matched as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Match a key at the current point in the string.
<dl>
<dt><dd>
1a. If the hash has its <code>keymatch</code> property set to some regex, use that
regex to match the key.
<p></p>
<dt><dd>
1b. Otherwise, use <code>/\w+:/</code> to match the key.
<p></p></dl>
<li>
If a key isn't found at the current position in the string, the
match fails.
<p></p>
<li>
Otherwise, get the value in the hash corresponding to the matched
key.
<p></p>
<li>
If the is no entry for that key, the match fails.
<p></p>
<li>
If the hash doesn't have a <code>valuematch</code> property, the match
succeeds immediately.
<p></p>
<li>
Otherwise use the hash's <code>valuematch</code> property
(typically itself a regex) to extract the value at the current point
in the string.
<p></p>
<li>
If no value can be extracted, matching of the hash fails.
<p></p>
<li>
If the extracted value string is <code>eq</code> to the key's actual value,
matching of the original hash immediately succeeds.
<p></p>
<li>
Otherwise, matching of the original hash fails.
<p></p></ol>
<p>So matching a bare hash is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
    rule {
        $key := &lt;{ %hash.prop{keymatch} // /\w+:/ }&gt;    # find key
        &lt;( exists %hash{$key} )&gt;                        # if exists
        [ &lt;( not defined %hash.prop{valuematch} )&gt; ::   # done?
            &lt;null&gt;                                      # succeed
        |                                               # else
            $val := &lt;%hash.prop{valuematch}&gt;            # find value
                &lt;( $val eq %hash{$val} )&gt;               # assert eq
        ]
    }</pre>
<p>A typical <code>valuematch</code> might look like:</p>
<pre>
    rule {
        \s* =\&gt; \s*             # match =&gt; 
        $q:=(&lt;[&quot;']&gt;)            # match initial quote 
        $0:=( [ \\. | . ]*? )   # return matched value
        $q                      # match trailing quote 
    }</pre>
<p>In essence, the presence or absence of the <code>valuematch</code> property
controls whether the hash tries to match only keys, or both keys
and values.</p>
<p>A hash may be used inside angles as well.  In that case, it finds
the key by the same method (steps 1 and 2 above), but always
treats the corresponding hash value as a regex (regardless of any
properties the hash might have).  The parse then continues according to
the rule found in the hash.  For example, we could parse a set
of control structures with:</p>
<pre>
    rule { &lt;%controls&gt; }</pre>
<p>The <code>%controls</code> hash can have keys like &quot;<code>if</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>while</code>&quot; in it. The
corresponding entry says how to parse the rest of an <code>if</code> or a
<code>while</code> statement.  For example:</p>
<pre>
        %controls = ( 
            if     =&gt; / &lt;condition&gt;      &lt;closure&gt; /,
            unless =&gt; / &lt;condition&gt;      &lt;closure&gt; /,
            while  =&gt; / &lt;condition&gt;      &lt;closure&gt; /,
            until  =&gt; / &lt;condition&gt;      &lt;closure&gt; /,
            for    =&gt; / &lt;list_expr&gt;      &lt;closure&gt; /,
            loop   =&gt; / &lt;loop_controls&gt;? &lt;closure&gt; /,
        );</pre>
<p>So saying:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;%controls&gt;</pre>
<p>is really much as if we'd said:</p>
<pre>
    [ if     \b &lt;%controls{if}&gt;
    | unless \b &lt;%controls{unless}&gt; 
    | while  \b &lt;%controls{while}&gt;
    | until  \b &lt;%controls{until}&gt; 
    | for    \b &lt;%controls{for}&gt; 
    | loop   \b &lt;%controls{loop}&gt;
    ]</pre>
<p>Only it actually works more like</p>
<pre>
    / $k=&lt;{ %controls.prop{keymatch} // /\w+:/ }&gt; &lt;%controls{$k}&gt; /</pre>
<p>Note that in Perl 6 it's perfectly valid to use <code>//</code> inside an expression embedded in a regex
delimited by slashes.  That's because a regex is no longer considered
a string, so we don't have to find the end of it before we parse it.
Since we can parse it in one pass, the expression parser can handle
the <code>//</code> when it gets to it without worrying about the outer slash, and
the final slash is recognized as the terminator by the regex parser
without having to worry about anything the expression parser saw.</p>
<p>A bare subroutine call may be used in a regex, provided it starts with
<code>&amp;</code> and uses parentheses around the arguments.  The return value of the
subroutine is matched literally.  The subroutine may have side effects,
and may throw an exception to fail.</p>

<h3><a name="defining your own rules">Defining Your Own Rules</a></h3>
<p>Suppose your name is Hugo and you don't like to use <code>!</code> to negate an assertion.
You can define your own assertion like this:</p>
<pre>
    my rule not (str $rx) { &lt;!&lt;{&quot;&lt;$rx&gt;&quot;}&gt;&gt; }            # define Hugo not
    / &lt;not [a-z]&gt; /     # same as &lt;![a-z]&gt;</pre>
<p>That rule would be lexically scoped because of the <code>my</code>.  If you think it looks like a <code>sub</code> declaration,
you're right.  In fact, it's possible you could even declare it anonymously like a closure:</p>
<pre>
    my $not = rule (str $rx) { &lt;!&lt;{&quot;&lt;$rx&gt;&quot;}&gt;&gt; };
    / &lt;$not tonight dear&gt; /</pre>
<p>But maybe you don't want it lexically scoped because you're writing
a grammar for general use:</p>
<pre>
    grammar HugoGrammar {
         rule not ($rx) { &lt;!$rx&gt; }
         rule identifier { &lt;not before \d&gt; \w+ }
         rule \j { \c[LF] }
         rule parse { ^ &lt;identifier&gt; \j $ }
    }</pre>
<pre>
    HugoGrammar.parse($line);</pre>
<p>In this case a rule is simply a method in a grammar class, and a
grammar class is any class derived implicitly or explicitly from the
universal RULE grammar class.  The built-in regex assertions like
<code>&lt;before \w&gt;</code> are really just calls to methods in the RULE class.
The namespace of a grammar is simply the method namespace of the current
class, which is the class's methods plus all inherited methods.</p>
<p>In addition to normal subrules, we allow some funny looking method
names like:</p>
<pre>
    rule :a { ... }
    rule \a { ... }</pre>
<p>Modules that mutate Perl's grammar on the fly can do so by deriving an
anonymous grammar class from the default Perl6Grammar, and installing
extra rules on the fly.  The current regex state then continues
parsing the rest of the lexical scope using some rule from the new
rule set.  Subsequent grammatical mutations will be derived from the
current anonymous grammar unless you switch explicitly to an entirely
different grammar.</p>
<p>Since we're writing grammar rules as if they were methods, we have
access to the full syntax of method declaration, including formal
parameter lists and compile-time properties.  So we can easily annotate
rules with pragmatic information such as operator precedence levels
when you don't want to write a strictly recursive-descent parser, for
instance.  (And we don't want to, for Perl.)</p>

<h3><a name="accepted rfcs">Accepted RFCs</a></h3>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/72.html" name="rfc 072: variablelength lookbehind.">RFC 072: Variable-length lookbehind.</a></h3>
<p>This seems good to me.  It's just a SMOP to reverse the ordering of
nodes in the syntax tree, and I think we can pretty well determine
when it's impossible to reverse the tree.  The operation of a reversed
syntax tree will not be totally transparent, however, so it will
be necessary to document that quantifiers will actually be working
right-to-left rather than left-to-right.  (It's probably also a good
idea to document that many syntactic constructs can't actually be
reliably recognized in reverse.  An attempt to do so probably means
you needed to do a lookahead earlier, rather than a lookbehind later.)</p>
<p>The syntax of lookbehind uses the new assertion syntax:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;after ...&gt;         # positive lookbehind
    &lt;!after ...&gt;        # negative lookbehind</pre>
<p>Yes, the <code>pos()</code> function could return multiple values in list context,
but I think it's more reasonable for the individual captured elements
to know where their positions are.  The <code>pos</code> function is really
just a special case of a more general data structure contained in the
regex result object from the last successful match.  In which case,
maybe it really needs to have a better name than <code>pos</code>.  Maybe <code>$0</code>
or something.  Then we get <code>$0.beg</code> and <code>$0.end</code>, <code>$1.beg</code>,
and <code>$1.end</code>, etc.  Since <code>@$0</code> returns a list of captures, you
can do <code>@$0^.beg</code> and <code>@$0^.end</code> if you want a list of beginnings
and endings.  Did I mention that the magical <code>@+</code> and <code>@-</code> arrays
are gonna be real dead?  Never could remember which one was which
anyway...</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/93.html" name="rfc 093: regex: support for incremental pattern matching">RFC 093: Regex: Support for incremental pattern matching</a></h3>
<p>I don't think this proposal is powerful enough.  &quot;Infinite&quot; strings are
a more powerful concept.  But I don't think infinite strings are
powerful enough either!</p>
<p>We're certainly going to have &quot;infinite&quot; arrays for which missing
elements are defined by a generator (where the action could be as simple as
reading more data from some other source).  We could do the same thing for strings
directly, or we could define strings that are implemented underneath
via arrays (of strings or of stringifiable objects), and achieve
infinitude that way.  This latter approach has the benefit that the
array element boundaries could be meaningful as zero-width boundaries
between, say, tokens in a token stream.  We're thinking that <code>&lt;,&gt;</code>
could match such a boundary.</p>
<p>But beyond that, such arrays-as-strings could allow us to associate
hidden metadata with the tokens, if the abstract string
is constructed from a list of objects, or a list of strings with
properties.  This is typically how a parser would receive data from
a lexical analyzer.  It's the parser's job to transform the linear
stream of objects into a parse tree of objects.</p>
<p>Matching against such boundaries or metadata would not be possible
unless ether the regex engine is aware that it is matching against an
array, or the string emulation provides visibility through the abstract
string into the underlying array.  The latter may be preferable,
since (by the rules of the <code>=~</code> matrix discussed in Apocalypse 4)
<code>@array =~ /regex/</code> is currently interpreted as matching against
each element of the array individually rather than sequentially, and
there are other uses for a string that's really an array.  In fact,
<code>@array =~ /regex/</code> could conceivably be matching against a set of
infinite strings in parallel, though that seems a bit scary.</p>
<p>Even if we don't care about the boundaries between array elements, this
approach gives us the ability to read a file in chunks and not worry
that the pattern won't match because it happens to span a boundary.</p>
<p>It might be objected that matching against a subroutine rather than
an infinite string or array has the benefit of not promising to keep
around the entire string or array in memory.  But this is not really
a feature, since in general a regex can potentially backtrack all
the way to the beginning of the string.  And there's nothing to say
that the front of the infinite string or array has to stay around
anyway.  Whether to throw away the head of a string or array should
really depend on the programmer, and I don't think there's a more
intuitive way to manage that than to simply let the programmer whack
off the front of the string or array using operators like <code>substr</code>
or <code>splice</code>, or the new <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code> assertion.</p>
<p>Indeed, the very existence of the string/array precludes the caching
problem that RFC 316 complains about.</p>
<p>The question remains how to declare such a string/array.  If we decided
to do a magical name identification, we could conceivably declare</p>
<pre>
    my $@array;</pre>
<p>and then both <code>$array</code> and <code>@array</code> refer to the same object, but treated
as a string when you say <code>$array</code> and as an array when you say <code>@array)</code>.
One is tempted to set up the input routine by saying</p>
<pre>
    my $@array is from { &lt;$input&gt; };</pre>
<p>Additional lines (or chunks) would then come from the <code>&lt;$input&gt;</code> iterator.</p>
<p>But really, the infinite nature of the array is a feature of the underlying
object, not the variable.  After all, we want to be able to say</p>
<pre>
    @array := 1..Inf;</pre>
<p>even with an ordinary array.</p>
<p>So we could even make this work:</p>
<pre>
    my $@array := &lt;$input&gt;;</pre>
<p>But I think we need to break the aliasing down, which will give us more flexibility
at the expense of more verbiage:</p>
<pre>
    my @array := &lt;$input&gt;;              # @array now bound to iterator
    my $array is ArrayString(@array);   # an ordinary tie</pre>
<p>That would let us do cool and/or sick things like this:</p>
<pre>
    my @lines := &lt;$article&gt;;
    my $_ is ArrayString(@lines);</pre>
<pre>
    s/^ .*? \n&lt;2,&gt; //;  # delete header from $_ AND @lines!
    for @lines { ... }  # process remaining lines</pre>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop potentially runs forever, since <code>@lines</code> is implicitly
extended from an iterator.  The array is automatically extended on
the end, but it's not automatically shifted on the front.  So if you
really did want the loop to run forever without exhausting memory,
you'd need to say something like:</p>
<pre>
    substr($_, 0, $_.pos, &quot;&quot;);</pre>
<p>The same effect can be effected within a regex by asserting <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code>, which makes the
current position the new string beginning.  (If you backtrack over <code>&lt;cut&gt;</code>, the entire
match will fail.)</p>

<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/110.html" name="rfc 110: counting matches">RFC 110: counting matches</a></h3>
<p>I think we can avoid using any options if we make a pattern count matches
when used in a numeric context.  If in doubt, make it explicit:</p>
<pre>
    $count = +/foo/;</pre>
<p>If it turns out we do need an option, it'll probably be <code>:n</code>.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/112.html" name="rfc 112: assignment within a regex">RFC 112: Assignment within a regex</a></h3>
<p>This RFC is basically covered by the <code>$foo:=(...)</code> notation, plus
variations.  The RFC claims that such assignments are not done till
the end, except that they are done ahead of closures.  I'd rather
state it the other way around: it always appears that the current
hypothetical binding is assigned if you check, but as long as the
optimizer can determine that you aren't looking, it doesn't have to
keep up appearances.  Contrariwise, if <code>$foo</code> is just a fancy way
of saying <code>$1</code>, there may in fact be no more overhead in maintaining
<code>$foo</code> than <code>$1</code>.  Either is really just pointing into a table of offsets
into the string.  That's assuming we get the scoping right on
hypothetical variables.</p>
<p>Some excerpts from the RFC:</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>The camel and the docs include this example:</em>
<pre>
       if (/Time: (..):(..):(..)/) {
            $hours = $1;
            $minutes = $2;
            $seconds = $3;
        }</pre>
<p><em>This then becomes:</em></p>
<pre>
      /Time: (?$hours=..):(?$minutes=..):(?$seconds=..)/</pre>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Now that looks like this:</p>
<pre>
      /Time\: $hours:=(..) \: $minutes:=(..) \: $seconds:=(..)/</pre>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>It may be appropriate for any assignments made before a code callout
to be localized so they can unrolled should the expression finally fail.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Rather than localized (or temporized), they are hypothesized.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>The first versions of this RFC did not allow for backrefs.  I now think this
was a shortcoming.  It can be done with <code>(??{quotemeta $foo})</code>, but I find this
clumsy, a better way of using a named back ref might be <code>(?\$foo)</code>.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Backrefs are now unified with hypothetical variables, so the issue doesn't arise.
Just use <code>$foo</code>.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>Using this method for capturing wanted content, it might be desirable to stop
ordinary brackets capturing, and needing to use <code>(?:...)</code>.  I therefore suggest
that as an enhancement to regexes that /b (bracket?) ordinary brackets just
group, without capture - in effect they all behave as <code>(?:...)</code>.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>There's no need for a <code>/b</code> now that we have <code>[...]</code> for non-capturing brackets.</p>

<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/144.html" name="rfc 144: behavior of empty regex should be simple">RFC 144: Behavior of empty regex should be simple</a></h3>
<p>I agree, the behavior should be simple.  However, rather than always
matching, I propose to make it an error to actually have a null
pattern, or a null choice in a list of alternatives.  Use an explicit
<code>&lt;null&gt;</code> if that's what you mean.  (It's not a problem if <code>$foo</code> is null
in <code>/$foo/</code>, since variables are now managed by the regex engine and
not by interpolation.)</p>
<p>

<p>The <code>$foo:=(...)</code> notation essentially covers that case.  One can say:</p>
<pre>
    / %hash{foo}:=(...) %hash{bar}:=(...) /</pre>
<p>Fancier things can be done with closures.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/156.html" name="rfc 156: replace first match function (...) with a flag to the match command.">RFC 156: Replace first match function (<code>?...?</code>) with a flag to the match command.</a></h3>
<p>Having a <code>:f</code> modifier seems like a reasonable way to do it:</p>
<pre>
    m:f/.../</pre>
<p>Though it's vaguely possible we should be having a set of verbs that
parse like <code>split</code>:</p>
<pre>
    split /.../
    count /.../
    first /.../</pre>
<p>It's not clear whether those are actually methods, and if so, on
which object, the string or the regex.  In any event, I don't think
we have to nail that down quite yet.  I'm accepting the basic premise
of this RFC that the <code>?...?</code> construct is going away, one way or another.</p>
<p>At the moment, it looks like this option is spelled <code>:once</code>.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/165.html" name="rfc 165: allow variables in tr///">RFC 165: Allow Variables in tr///</a></h3>
<p>If interpolation of patterns by default is wrong, I think extending the <code>tr///</code>
interface via scalar interpolation is doubly wrong.  Run-time
generated transliterations should be based on mappings that aren't
so position dependent.  That is, rather than specifying it as two
long lists:</p>
<pre>
    abc12xyz =&gt; ABC34XYZ</pre>
<p>we specify something more like this:</p>
<pre>
    abc =&gt; ABC
    12  =&gt; 34
    xyz =&gt; XYZ</pre>
<p>That looks more like a list of pairs of scalars than a pair of scalars.
In fact, internally, it's done like a funny parallel substitution:</p>
<pre>
    s:e(/a/A/,
        /b/B/,
        /c/C/,
        /1/3/,
        /2/4/,
        /x/X/,
        /y/Y/,
        /z/Z/)</pre>
<p>In any event, it's more like <code>tr/@foo/@bar/</code> than <code>tr/$foo/$bar/</code>.
But then, why stick with the fake string notation?  Why not just say
<code>tr(@foo,@bar)</code> if that's what we mean?  Then we're not limited
to character substitutions:</p>
<pre>
    $string.tr [ &quot; &quot;     , &quot;&lt;&quot;   , &quot;&gt;&quot;   , &quot;\n&quot;   ],
               [ &quot;&amp;nbsp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot; ];</pre>
<p>Or how about <code>tr(%trans)</code>?</p>
<pre>
    %upper = {
        &quot;a-z&quot; =&gt; &quot;A-Z&quot;,
    }
    $string.tr %upper;</pre>
<p>or just pair lists of some sort:</p>
<pre>
    $string.tr(&quot;a-c&quot; =&gt; &quot;x-z&quot;,
               &quot;1-2&quot; =&gt; &quot;3-4&quot;,
               &quot;A-C&quot; =&gt; &quot;X-Z&quot;,
              );</pre>
<pre>
    @trans = [
        &quot;a-z&quot; =&gt; &quot;A-Z&quot;,
        @tr_danish,
    ];</pre>
<pre>
    $string.tr(@trans)</pre>

<p>Alternative lists of subrules are included with:</p>
<pre>

<p>There's no longer any need for quoting constructs because variables

<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/191.html" name="rfc 191: smart container slicing">RFC 191: smart container slicing</a></h3>
<p>As proposed, this might prevent us from using a regex object as a
key to a hash.  However, with some tweaking, it'll fit in with
how slicing is done in Perl 6.</p>
<p>Perl 6 will DWIM subscripts based on their appearance.  Obviously,</p>
<pre>
    %hash{&quot;foo&quot;}</pre>
<p>has a single subscript.  And just as obviously,</p>
<pre>
    %hash{&quot;a&quot; .. &quot;z&quot;}</pre>
<p>has 26 subscripts or so.  In the absence of any scalar guidance, a subscript
will be interpreted in list context.  So</p>
<pre>
    %hash{ @array }</pre>
<p>will automatically slice on the list of keys in the array.
Any function will be called in a list context by default, giving it
the opportunity to return multiple values.  Perl 6 subscripts are
naturally biased toward slicing.  To unbias it, here are some of the
specifically recognized subscripts:</p>
<pre>
    %hash{&quot;foo&quot;}        # scalar literal
    %hash{bar}          # scalar literal
    %hash{1}            # scalar literal
    %hash{$x}           # scalar variable
    %hash{\$x}          # scalar reference
    %hash{[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]}   # array reference
    %hash{{&quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;b&quot;}} # hash reference
    %hash{ &quot;a&quot; =&gt; &quot;b&quot; } # pair reference
    %hash{ /pat/ }      # rule reference
    %hash{ _ expr }     # force expr to return a single string
    %hash{ + expr }     # force expr to return a single number</pre>
<p>Boolean expressions and closures look like singular values but cause
a match against all possible values of the subscript.</p>
<pre>
    %hash{ ?1 }         # select all subscripts
    %hash{ ?/pat/ }     # select subscripts for which pat matches
    %hash{ $_ =~ /pat/ }# select subscripts for which pat matches
    %hash{ $_ ge &quot;a&quot; }  # select lowercase keys (assuming ASCII)
    %hash{ .ge &quot;a&quot; }    # same thing, maybe
    %hash{ { expr } }   # select subscripts for which closure returns true</pre>
<p>Multiple slice subscripts are separated by semicolons, so that you can
use commas within each slice subscript for list building.  This is more
important for multi-dimensional arrays:</p>
<pre>
    my @array is dim(9,9,9) = cubic();</pre>
<pre>
    @3d_slice = @array[ @x; @y; @z ];
    @3d_slice = @array[ 0,1,3,8 ; 0,1,3,8; ?1 ];
    @3d_slice = @array[ 0..9 ; 0..9:-1; ?test($_) ];
    @3d_slice = @array[ !($_ % 2) ; 0..9:3; ?test($_) ];</pre>

<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/274.html" name="rfc 274: generalized additions to regexs">RFC 274: Generalized Additions to Regexs</a></h3>
<p>This proposal has significant early/late binding issues.  A definition
that forces run-time overhead is not as useful as it might be.
On the other hand, a pure compile-time mechanism is not as general
as it might be--but a compile-time mechanism can always compile in
a run-time mechanism if it chooses to defer evaluation.</p>
<p>So it seems like this is a good place for syntactic warpage of some
sort or other.  That would make it possible to do both compile-time
and run-time bindings.  We'll be using the <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> notation
for our extensible syntax, and the grammar rules for parsing that
particular part of Perl syntax will be just as easy to tweak as any
other Perl grammar rule.</p>
<p>That being said, the very fact that we can associate a grammar with
the regex means that it's easy to define any instance of <code>&lt;word&gt;</code>
to mean whatever you want it to.  (In a sense, these subrules are
the very callbacks that the RFC proposes.)  These subrules can be
bound either at Perl compile time or at Perl run time.  They can
be defined to take a string, regex, or Perl expression as an argument.  The latter
two cases are efficient because they come in as a regex or code reference
respectively.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>Following on, if (?{...}) etc code is evaluated in forward match, it would be
a good idea to likewise support some code block that is ignored on a forward
match but is executed when the code is unwound due to backtracking.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Yes, though hypothetical values take some of the pressure off for this.
But if a closure contained a BACK block, it could be automatically fired
off on backtracking.  As with LAST et al., I suppose there's a corresponding <code>back</code> property
on variables.  In a sense, saying</p>
<pre>
    let $var = $newval</pre>
<p>is much like saying</p>
<pre>
    our $var is back { .set($oldval) } = $newval</pre>
<p>except that <code>$var</code> may well be stored in the regex state object rather than
in a global symbol table.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/276.html" name="rfc 276: localising paren counts in qr()s.">RFC 276: Localising Paren Counts in qr()s.</a></h3>
<p>I agree totally.  As for the problem of pulling captures out of
a subrule, it's up to the subrule to determine what it &quot;returns&quot;.
We could make some intelligent defaults, though different kinds of
rules might want different defaults.  One approach might be to say
that if there is a single capture, that is returned as the result.
If there is no capture, it's as if the entire subpattern were captured.
If there are multiple captures, they are returned as an anonymous list.
So <code>$1</code> from such a subrule might come through like this:</p>
<pre>
    / $sub:=&lt;subrule&gt; { print $sub[1] } /</pre>
<p>or just:</p>
<pre>
    / &lt;subrule&gt; { print $subrule[1] } /</pre>
<p>But named captures and named rules intrude on this idyllic picture.
You'd also like a default anonymous hash value returned that is keyed
by all the named captures or rules.  The question is whether that forces
numbered captures to come through the hash interface.  Or maybe that's
just always the case, so to get at <code>$1</code> of a subrule, you'd say:</p>
<pre>
    / $sub:=&lt;subrule&gt; { print $sub{'1'} } /</pre>
<p>But there are reasons for wanting to treat the result object as an array, so that</p>
<pre>
    / $sub:=&lt;subrule&gt; { process(@$sub) } /</pre>
<p>processes all the numbered captures from the subrule.  So I think the
return object behaves either like a hash or an array as appropriate.
(Note that such an array might be declared to have an origin at 1 rather
than 0.)</p>

<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/317.html" name="rfc 317: access to optimisation information for regular expressions">RFC 317: Access to optimisation information for regular expressions</a></h3>
<p>Seems like a no-brainer.  All such information is likely to be
available to Perl anyway, given that we'd like to do the parser,
optimizers, and code generators in Perl if at all possible.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/331.html" name="rfc 331: consolidate the $1 and \1 notations">RFC 331: Consolidate the <code>$1</code> and <code>\1</code> notations</a></h3>
<p>I like the title of this RFC.  It fits in with the new <code>my</code> policy of
immediate introduction.  However, there are certain difficulties with
the proposed implementation.  The statement-by-statement setting of
the <code>@/</code> array looks pretty ugly to me.  I'd rather have a consistent
view of hypothetical variables that can live on outside the regex in
question without regard to statement boundaries.  In the rare event
that someone needs to refer to <code>$1</code> (or anything else) from a prior
regex, a temporary variable should be used.</p>
<p>

<p>Another RFC that is accepted in principle, but that doesn't go far enough.
The <code>/s</code> modifier is going away, along with <code>/m</code>.
A <code>$</code> will always mean end-of-string, and <code>$$</code> will match
at the end of any line.  (The current process id is now <code>$*PID</code>, by the way,
so there's no conflict there.  But how often to you want to write a
pattern to match the current process id anyway?)</p>

<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/348.html" name="rfc 348: regex assertions in plain perl code">RFC 348: Regex assertions in plain Perl code</a></h3>
<p>This RFC makes some good points, though the code assertion syntax will be:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;( code )&gt;</pre>
<p>The RFC also makes a case for getting rid of the special behavior of
<code>local</code> in Perl 5, which treated <code>local</code> differently within a regex.
However, something very like the <code>local</code> behavior will still be
needed for making hypotheses, though the RFC is correct that it's
not needed in the typical code assertion,  In Perl 6, localization is
done with <code>temp</code>, and it will not do the hypothetical variable hack
that Perl 5 did.  Instead there will be an explicit lvalue modifier,
<code>let</code>, which specifically requests a variable's value to be scoped
to the success of the current point in the regex.  These hypothetical
variables actually have much broader use than this RFC suggests.</p>
<p>Perl 5's hardwired use of <code>$^R</code> just translates to an appropriately
named hypothetical variable in Perl 6.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/360.html" name="rfc 360: allow multiply matched groups in regexes to return a listref of all matches">RFC 360: Allow multiply matched groups in regexes to return a listref of all matches</a></h3>
<p>I think that parens that can potentially match multiple times will
automatically produce a list rather than matching the final one.
It's not as if we can't tell whether something's inside a quantifier...</p>
<p>Here's the RFC's proposed solution:</p>
<pre>
    while ($text =~ /name:\s*(.*?)\n\s*
                    children:\s*(?:(?@\S+)[, ]*)*\n\s*
                    favorite\ colors:\s*(?:(?@\S+)[, ]*)*\n/sigx) {
        # now we have:
        #  $1 = &quot;John Abajace&quot;;
        #  $2 = [&quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, &quot;Harry&quot;]
        #  $3 = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;]
    }</pre>
<p>Apart from the change in behavior of <code>(...)</code> within a quantifier, I have
the urge to rewrite this example for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre>
    The C&lt;/x&gt; and C&lt;/s&gt; flags no longer exist.</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    The C&lt;/i&gt; and C&lt;/g&gt; flags must be pulled out to the front for visibility.
    (And the C&lt;/g&gt; flag is renamed C&lt;:e&gt;).</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    There's now a C&lt;\h&gt; for horizontal whitespace, and C&lt;\H&gt; for the negation
    of that.  (Not that RFC is incorrect to use C&lt;\s&gt;.)</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    The negation of C&lt;\n&gt; is now C&lt;\N&gt;.</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    The C&lt;:&gt; character is now a metacharacter, and so must be backslashed.</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    Character classes are now represented with C&lt;&lt; &lt;[...]&gt; &gt;&gt;.</pre>
<li>
<pre>
    Grouping is now represented with C&lt;[...]&gt;.</pre>
</ul>
<p>With these changes, and making better use of whitespace, the sample
regex ends up looking like this:</p>
<pre>
    for ($text =~ m:ie[
                            name             \: \h*   (\N*?)            \n
                        \h* children         \: \h* [ (\S+) &lt;[,\h]&gt;* ]* \n
                        \h* favorite\ colors \: \h* [ (\S+) &lt;[,\h]&gt;* ]* \n
                      ]
          )
    {
             # now we have:
             #  $1 = &quot;John Abajace&quot;;
             #  $2 = [&quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, &quot;Harry&quot;]
             #  $3 = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;]
    }</pre>
<p>I think in the long run people will find this more readable once
they're used to it.  Certainly tabularizing the parallelisms will
make any typing errors stand out.</p>

<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/361.html" name="rfc 361: simplifying split()">RFC 361: Simplifying <code>split()</code></a></h3>
<p>The RFC makes five suggestions.  I'll consider them one by one.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>The first argument to split is currently interpreted as a
regexp, regardless of whether or not it actually is one.  (Yes,
<code>split '.', $foo</code> doesn't split on dot -- it's currently the same an
<code>split /./, $foo</code>.)  I suggest that split be changed to treat only
regexps as regexps, and everything else as literals.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Fine, I think.  If the first argument to <code>split</code> is untyped, it
should parse correctly, either evaluating a quoted string immediately
or deferring interpretation of a regex.  One could even do something
like split on the first delimiter matched by another pattern:</p>
<pre>
    split _/(,|;)/;</pre>
<p>That would split on either all commas or all semicolons, depending on
which it found first in the string.  The _ forces the regex to return
a string, which is whatever was captured by the parens in this case.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>Empty trailing fields are currently suppressed (although a
-1 as the third argument disables this).  I suggest that empty trailing
fields be retained by default.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Probably okay, though we need a way to translate old code.  It was
originally done this way because split on whitespace would typically
return an extra field after the newline.  But most newlines will
be prechomped in Perl 6.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em>When not in list context, split currently splits into <code>@_</code>.  I
suggest that this side-effect be removed.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Fine.  It's easy enough to translate to an explicit assignment.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em><code>split ?pat?</code> in any context currently splits into <code>@_</code>.  I suggest
that this side-effect be removed.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>Fine.  I don't think anyone uses that.</p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<em><code>split ' '</code> (but not <code>split / /</code>) currently splits on whitespace,
but also removes leading empty fields.  I suggest that this
irregularity be removed.</em>
<p></p></dl>
<p>The question is, what to replace it with, since it's a very handy
construct.  We could use a different conventional pattern:</p>
<pre>
    @array = split /&lt;ws&gt;/, $string;</pre>
<p>Or we could say that it's now a split on whitespace only if
the split argument is unspecified.  That wouldn't work very well with
the old syntax, where we often have to supply the second argument.
But given that the <code>=~</code> operator now serves as a topicalizer for any term,
we could translate:</p>
<pre>
    @array = split ' ', $string;</pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre>
    @array = $string =~ split;</pre>
<p>Oddly, this probably also works:</p>
<pre>
    $string =~ (@array = split);</pre>
<p>or maybe even this:</p>
<pre>
    @array = split given $string;</pre>
<p>But I think I like the OO notation better here anyway:</p>
<pre>
    @array = $string.split;</pre>
<p>In fact, split may not be a function at all.  The default split might
just be a string method and use unary dot:</p>
<pre>
    @array = .split;</pre>
<p>We still have the third argument to deal with, but that's likely to be specified
like this:</p>
<pre>
    @array = $string.split(limit =&gt; 3);</pre>
<p>We could conceivably make a different method for word splitting, much like REXX does:</p>
<pre>
    @array = .words;</pre>
<p>Then a limit could be the first argument:</p>
<pre>
    @array = .words(3);</pre>
<p>But there almost doesn't need to be such a method, since</p>
<pre>
    @array = m/ [ (\S*) \s* ]* /;</pre>
<p>will do the right thing.  Admittedly, a <code>.words</code> method would be much more readable...</p>
<p>Fortunately, <code>split</code> is a function, so I can put off that decision till Apocalypse 29.  <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>Squish that gnat...  <code>:-)</code></p>
<p>A decent Perl parser is still going to have to keep track of whether
a term or an operator is expected.  And while we're simplifying
the grammar in many ways, it's also the case that we're letting
users install their own grammar rules to perform syntactic warpage.
Besides, people <em>like</em> to write patterns with <code>/.../</code>.  So rather
than impoverishing Perl's syntax artificially, let's make the standard
parser more accessible by writing it all in Perl 6 regexes.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/145.html" name="rfc 145: bracematching for perl regular expressions">RFC 145: Brace-matching for Perl Regular Expressions</a></h3>
<p>Good problem, not-so-good solution from a complexity point of view.  I'd like
to leverage existing character class and backref notations maybe.  If there were
simply some way to tell a backref to invert any match characters, that might do it.
Or maybe reverse them when you remember them, and leave the backref ignorant?
(Downside is nested brackets would probably need recursive patterns.)</p>
<p>Recursion might be advisable anyway--you can't really pick up the arguments to a
function, for instance, without also handling things like quoted strings, which may
have different bracketing rules than outside of strings.  Certainly matching <code>\&quot;</code>
would be dependent on whether you're inside or outside of a string.  Given that
recursion is often necessary, I'm not sure making this construct recurse itself
is all that useful.</p>
<p>Along the lines of how <code>tr///</code> works (or ought to work), I think it'd
be more generally useful to have character remapping facility within
a backref generator:</p>
<pre>
    (
     &lt;[ \( \[ \{ \&lt; ] =&gt;
      [ \) \] \} \&gt; ]&gt; )</pre>
<p>That might match a left bracket of some sort but return the corresponding right bracket as <code>$1</code>.
But maybe we should just use an &quot;existing&quot; mechanism to translate strings:</p>
<pre>
    my %closing = {
        '[' =&gt; ']',
        '(' =&gt; ')',
        '{' =&gt; '}',
        '&lt;' =&gt; '&gt;',
    };
    rule balanced {
        &lt;![\[\(\{\&lt;\]\)\}\&gt;]&gt;*  # any non-brackets
        [                       # followed by either
            $                   #   end of string
        |                       # or
            $b := &lt;[[({&lt;]&gt;      #   an opening bracket
            &lt;self&gt;              #   containing a balanced expr
            %closing{$b}        #   followed by corresponding close bracket
            &lt;self&gt;              #   followed by a balanced expr
        ]
     }</pre>

<p>All operators will have a way to name them, which means it's
possible to alias them to any other name.  Rearranging the formal
order of parameters would be a little harder, however.  We need
inlining to do that efficiently.  Still, now that <code>//</code> doesn't
evaluate in a typeless context, it's relatively straightforward
to define a subroutine or method that does</p>
<pre>
    subst $string, /foo/, {&quot;bar&quot;}</pre>
<p>in whatever order you like.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/197.html" name="rfc 197: numeric value ranges in regular expressions">RFC 197: Numeric Value Ranges In Regular Expressions</a></h3>
<p>If we go down this road, eventually we reinvent all of Perl syntax in
regular expressions.  Not that I'm against TMTOWTDI, but I'd rather
have a better way to run Perl code from within a regex and have it
&quot;succeed&quot; or &quot;fail&quot;, and maybe better ways to test ranges from
Perl code.  Anything beyond that could be done with syntactic
warpage.</p>
<p>In any event, overloading <code>()</code> and <code>[]</code> for this would be mentally treacherous,
not to mention completely opaque to non-mathematicians.  We'll stick
with the standard boolean assertion:</p>
<pre>
    / (\d+) &lt;( $1 =~ 1..10 )&gt; /</pre>
<p>Interestingly, that can also be written:</p>
<pre>
    / &lt;( _/\d+/ =~ 1..10 )&gt; /</pre>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/198.html" name="rfc 198: boolean regexes">RFC 198: Boolean Regexes</a></h3>
<p>Again, I'm not much in favor of inventing new regex syntax that duplicates
ordinary Perl syntax.  I think we need richer ways of interconnecting
related regexes via ordinary Perl syntax.  Certainly it helps to
have an easy way to specify a Perl assertion:</p>
<pre>
    / (\w+) &lt;( %count{$1} &gt; 3 )&gt; /</pre>
<p>But there's something to be said for forcing submatch assertions to be
defined externally to the current regex, much like we discourage
inline code where subroutine calls are in order.</p>
<p>So anyway, I think most of the submatches like onion rings should
be handled simply by searching on captured strings within a closure.
Booleans can be put into closures as well, but the new <code>::</code> operator
makes it pretty easy to AND and OR assertions together in a more
regexly fashion without reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>As proposed, there will be a &quot;fail&quot; token, but it's spelled <code>&lt;fail&gt;</code>, not <code>\F</code>.
And the &quot;true&quot; token is spelled <code>&lt;null&gt;</code>.  <code>:-)</code></p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/261.html" name="rfc 261: pattern matching on perl values">RFC 261: Pattern matching on perl values</a></h3>
<p>This reminds me a bit of unification in Prolog.  It's not explained
very well here, and I'm wondering if it will be too hard to explain
in general.  I think this is probably too powerful a concept for
the typical Perl programmer, who is lucky to understand simple lvalues
that always do what they're told.</p>
<p>This sort of matching can probably be provided as syntactic warpage,
though I'm not sure if that prevents useful optimizations.  Anyway,
this sort of thing is unlikely to make it into the Perl 6 core unless it
generalizes usefully to function argument lists, and it may be too
powerful for there too.  For that purpose it would resemble a form
of overloading, but with the &quot;types&quot; specified by keys.  I suspect
real types are more useful.</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/308.html" name="rfc 308: ban perl hooks into regexes">RFC 308: Ban Perl hooks into regexes</a></h3>
<p>We must be able to call back into Perl code if we want to write parsers
conveniently in Perl.  Think of how yacc works.  Certainly the way that
Perl 5 does it is ugly, I'll admit.  We can beautify that.</p>
<p>But the whole point of Perl is to have all the most useful &quot;Krakken
tentacles&quot;.  And I don't really care if it makes it hard to put the
Perl regex engine into some other language.  <code>:-)</code></p>

<h3><a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/316.html" name="rfc 316: regex modifier for support of chunk processing and prefix matching">RFC 316: Regex modifier for support of chunk processing and prefix matching</a></h3>
<p>Infinite strings (via infinite arrays) seem like a more useful concept.
It would be easy for the extension subroutine to fail and produce the
results desired in this RFC, but without the necessity of the extra
syntax specified by the RFC.  A match naturally fails when it gets to
the end of its string without finishing the pattern.  Incremental matching
can also easily be done via infinite strings, and the user interface
can be a simple as we like, as long as extension rule is somehow associated
with the string in question.</p>
<p>I think <code>pos()</code> is rather too low-level a concept for general use.
Certainly it needs to be there, but I think we need some way of
implying that one regex is a continuation of a previous one, but within
some higher-level syntactic construct, so that it's easy to write
parsers without invoking <code>pos()</code> or <code>\g</code> or <code>/c</code> all over the place.</p>
