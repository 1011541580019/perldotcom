<p>You know, it's not easy having the happiness of billions of children
around the world resting with your organization, and it's even harder
on the IT department.  The incorporated elves and pixiefolk of
the North Pole, under the direction of their jolly old leader, have to deal
with massive quantities of data, huge manfacturing flows and what is
possibly the strictest delivery timetable in the world.  Despite these
challenges Santa and his reindeer have been able to meet their tight
deadline and achieve one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings
in industry.</p>
<p>For many centuries, the elves needed to work for only a couple of
months of the year to manufacture every gift for every child, but
recent advances in technology and the increasing global population
have, in the past two decades, left them working day and night all
year round, with only a few days of holiday before work had to begin
again in early Janurary.  During the early '90s, some workflow
improvements were made and some time savings were gained by using a
mainframe to coordinate the route Santa would take on the night before
Christmas, ensuring he could still visit every client during the 24
hours available.  By 1995, these savings had made only a small
difference to the performance of the operation, with representatives
of the Amalgamated Present Production and Sleigh Mechanics' Union
threatening to leak to the media predictions that Christmas might need
to be cancelled in 1998 and held bi-annually from then on if every
child was to receive presents on the same day.  The elves even
considered going on strike in 1996, but they reconsidered after seeing
the reaction of a young boy to his older brother's proof that Santa
Claus could not physically exist.  (Santa is, of course, entirely real
-- he just doesn't pay too much attention to natural laws.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, history took a different route and the North Pole escaped its
first industrial action since records began.  A searching review of
the whole production process included sending parts of the short
statured delivery facilitation team on outplacements in industry.  One
of the elves in this division was lucky enough to be sent along to an
emerging dot-com, where he discovered -- and instantly fell in love
with -- Perl.  He returned to the Pole brimming with enthusiasm and
soon convinced Santa (well, his wife, who then made Mr. Claus
convinced) that it would be possible to prepare for Christmas in a
matter of months, or maybe even weeks, if this emerging tool fulfilled
its early promise.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago, and now Perl powers Christmas.  Its diverse
realm of application, not to mention its slightly idiosyncratic
nature, fit the mindset of an elf perfectly and -- more importantly --
help them to get everything done in November and December, leaving
them the rest of the year to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>The first application of Perl was in the Health and Safety department.
For many years, the Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Avionic Reindeer was worried about the risks presented during landings
on roofs and increasingly from the potential for midair collisions with
aircraft.  An effort was undertaken to carefully map international air
corridors, catalog hazardous or unstable landing patches and (as
Santa's diet was underperforming) details of chimney widths for every
dwelling on the planet.  Needless to say maintaining this was a
nightmare -- until, that is, a custom set of tools was written in Perl
to allow Santa's scouts to take reports from the field using a
primitive Web interface.  The major benefit of Perl here was the speed
with which new types of reindeer strip could be added to the database
as the time needed to program the necessary logic to handle them was
reduced.</p>
<p>Perl continued to make inroads on the databases of Santa's grottos.
Next to fall to its rogueish charms was the global child distribution
and route planning systems.  These had been implemented on two
mainframes under two different packages but global population growth
scaled faster than the earlier architecture, requiring a shift to an
entirely new distributed design.  The database itself uses a commercial
package but the data migration was handled using Perl.  Its flexible
dynamic typing, object system and, above all, the set of DBI drivers
allowed Perl to talk to every database in its own language without the
programmers needing to learn each and every one of them.  This project
was completed ahead of schedule leaving the team of crack data migration
experts with little to do, so they were tasked to set their tools onto
the internally infamous naughtyness database.</p>

</div>
<hr size="2" noshade />

<p>The naughtyness database was, for many years, simply a set of paper
files kept in a filing cabinet in a dungeon by a troll.  Every year,
the troll would carefully collate every good deed and every black act
of every boy and girl the world over.  Before distributing presents on
Christmas day, Father Christmas would ask the troll if there were any
children that deserved coal instead.  Of course, due to his meticulous
record keeping the troll could honestly, if gruffly, reply &quot;no, not a
single child has been that bad.&quot;  The mounting volumes of data near
the end of the last century left the troll unable to keep up with
developments.  Soon he began to confuse one child with another,
sometimes he couldn't enter every good thought of every child and
eventually the system failed.  A child was assigned not one but two
sacks of coal.  Thankfully an internal investigation revealed the
problems faced by the troll and corrected the error, but it was
decided that the troll must be retired in favor of a system based on
the latest developments in artificial intelligence technologies.  The
review also concluded that the system should also modified so that
especially good children would get better presents delivered, and coal
was retired in favor of a good talking to from the troll who now
relishes his new line in community work.</p>
<p>Getting back to the technical details, the system needed to run
quickly (emulating a troll is not an easy undertaking, they may appear
dimwitted but are, in fact, deeply pondering the games of postal Go
they love so much).  At the same time, it had to allow for operators to
script the system and tune its operation using a high level language.
It was decided that the crucial parts of the program would be
implemented in C, with wrappers being written using the Inline::C
module allowing Perl to form the high level director of the system.
This proved to be a great sucess, with roughly 5 percent of children now
qualifying for bonus presents.  Elves are also queing up to work in
the new department, in part because of the rewarding work, but also
because the system allows them so much room to tinker with the
criteria for awards as each processing run is performed so quickly.</p>
<p>The recent explosion of the Internet has been both good and bad for
the elves in the mail room.  Santa receives many millions of letters
each year from all around the world, and now also gets about 10 times
as many e-mails.  For a time, these were processed in the same way as
the letters, but soon a new solution was required.  In the end, rather
than develop an in house tool, the elves adopted RT -- a trouble
ticketing and bug tracking system written in Perl -- to handle the
assignment of requests to manufacturing areas.  This allowed a much
closer match between the wishes of the children and the presents they
unwrapped come Dec. 25.  The elves also encountered a growing
problem from e-mail spam.  For a while, they naively assumed that Santa
should be sending viagra and his bank details to relatives of the
President of Nigeria, but eventually they twigged that odd things were
afoot.  A bit of research, and some help from the Perl community, led
them quickly to Mail::Audit and spamassassin as an optimal filter.</p>
<p>In line with many companies these days, the North Pole has started to
outsource its production of presents to commercial concerns.  Perl has
again been able to help with this effort by acting as a mediator
between the requirements database produced from letters to Santa and
the production systems of the outsourced manufacturers.  A combination
of freely available XML, SOAP and CORBA tools allow rapid creation of
interfaces to the systems of new partners and allow aggregation of
many external representations of an invoice to a single standard form
suitable for input to the internal accounting systems.</p>
<p>These accounting systems are written entirely in Perl, mostly because
commercial packages are not available to deal in the currency (sherry,
biscuits and carrots) of Santa's environs.  This highly available mission
critical application ensures that elves are well supplied with the
rewards for their work and keeps the workforce motivated the whole
year round.  Using a core engine written using Perl's framework for
multi user dungeons (and any other multitasking or massively networked
environments), POE, the system has scaled to process over one billion
transactions in a single day.  (The elves and reindeer are paid
yearly, on boxing day, out of the titbits left out in houses and
collected by Santa as he passes through.)</p>
<p>Fifi Longstockings, the chief software engineer and head of
blancmange parties, says of Perl: &quot;without Perl, I don't know what
would happen to our operation.  It's now critical to every area of our
business and contributes directly to the magic of Christmas.  It's
amazing just how much hard work and effort it has helped us avoid in
the past few years.  Here in the grotto we dare to be lazy and Perl is
the ideal tool for the inspired slacker who'd rather sing and dance
than spend longer than they need to at work.&quot;  He also looks forward
to the benefits that Perl 6 could bring, and is happy that Perl will
continue to be supported by the community for the foreseeable future:
&quot;Of course, Perl has come a long way since we started using it.  There
were some tasks it just couln't cope with before it gained an object
oriented framework and there are some things now we'd love to get done
using it but cannot.  Some of these should be possible with Perl 6
though, so we're investing a couple of our elves' time and some fairy
dust in parrot development at the moment.  It's certainly an exciting
time for us, and for Perl!&quot;</p>
