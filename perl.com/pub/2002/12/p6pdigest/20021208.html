<p>Another Monday evening. Another summary to write.</p>
<p>Starting, as is becoming tediously predictable, with perl6-internals.</p>


<h4><a name="another_jit_discussion">Another JIT Discussion</a></h4>
<p>Toward the end of the previous week, Leopold T&ouml;tsch posted
something about the latest round of changes to the JIT core. Daniel
Grunblatt was concerned that the current JIT wasn't doing the correct
thing when it came to hardware register allocation and wanted to remove a
some conditional logic. Leo didn't agree at first, but became
convinced and Daniel's requested change was applied.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=200212011301.08982.daniel%40grunblatt.com.ar">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>


<h4><a name="fun_with_imcc">Fun With IMCC</a></h4>
<p>Many things happened with IMCC this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
David Robins posted a list of minor niggles (For instance, it turns
out you can't <code>ret</code> early from a <code>.sub</code>) and suggested some
remedies. Leo T&ouml;tsch mentioned that the IMCC Cabal (which
would consist of Melvin Smith, Sean O'Rourke, Angel Faus and Leo if
there were a Cabal. But, as everyone knows, There Is No Cabal) has
been discussing several of these issues.
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=Pine.LNX.4.44.0212021417160.14941-100000%40davidrobins.net">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3DEC68A8.6070900%40toetsch.at">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p></li>


<li>
Art Haas had problems building IMCC, apparently bison didn't like the
<em>imcc.y</em> file. Leo tracked down the problem (when asked a second time; I think he might be slipping) and checked in a working fix.</li>


<li>
Leo T&ouml;tsch made a pile of changes to IMCC to eliminate clashes
between Parrot's PASM language and IMCC's PIR syntax, which had made
it hard to mix the two. Full details of the changes are in his post.
<p>Gopal V wondered whether there was any way of feeding code to IMCC beyond
simply writing to a file and running IMCC. He'd had to make a bunch of
changes to the IMCC files that he used, and wondered whether there was a
better way. Actually, he didn't so much wonder as propose the
aforementioned better way, lifting ideas from DotGNU's <em>treecc</em>. He
and Leo discussed things, worked out an interface and Gopal went off
to implement something. (Yay Gopal!)</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3DECC08A.8090208%40toetsch.at">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20021204004556.A3407%40md3.vsnl.net.in">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p></li>


<li>
Steve Fink posted a patch implementing a first cut at namespace
support in IMCC. He wasn't at all sure that what he'd implemented was
the right thing, but it supplied what he needed for the time being (if
that makes sense) in the regex engine. Leo reckoned that it looked
OK, and promised to apply it if nobody hollered. He also pointed out
some problems with the current regex implementation to do with
re-entrancy and memory leakage. It turns out that Steve was working on
<em>languages/regex</em> rather than the <code>rx_*</code> ops, which are the ones
that have the problems.
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-18856-43866.10.1988319398784%40bugs6.perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p></li>

<li>
Gregor N. Purdy had some problems with IMCC's syntax, a fragment of
code that he thought should work fell over in a heap.  Both Mr. Nobody
and Leo pointed out that IMCC expects subroutines, and you should wrap
your code in a <code>.sub</code>/<code>.end</code> pair.
<p>Once Gregor had that straight, he posted a Jako program and the IMCC
code he thought the Jako compiler should generate from it and asked
for any feedback before he went to change the compiler. Leo
T&ouml;tsch provided some (I assume) useful feedback.</p>
<p>A little later Gregor posted again, and he was still having problems with
IMCC not quite behaving as he wanted for the Jako compiler. He and Leo
thrashed it out over a few messages and, to cut a long story short,
IMCC looks like it won't be changing. I'm not sure whether Gregor is
happy about this ... .</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=OF62DC53C8.485EA6B9-ON85256C85.00523820-85256C85.0052B894%40kennedytech.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>

</li>

<li>
Mr. Nobody posted a patch to get IMCC to compile under
Windows. Apparently, the <code>OUT</code> label clashes with something in the
Windows header files. The patch was applied.
</li>

<li>
Gregor N. Purdy got a little confused by how IMCC generates PASM code,
and posted some sample code, interspersed with questions, which Leo
answered. It's worth looking at this; it shows off the kind of
optimization that IMCC gets up to.

</ul>


<h4><a name="pmcs_are_the_thing">PMCs Are the Thing</a></h4>
<p>Dan announced that he's finally stopped waffling and frozen the PMC
structures `modulo the odd twiddling to it.' He's added a <em>pmc.ops</em>
file, and has started adding in ops to manipulate PMC internals. Leo
asked for some clarifications, got some, and then wondered what the
final 'Parrot Object' would look like.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a05200f07ba12bc13c829%40%5B63.120.19.221%5D">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>


<h4><a name="logical_not_issue"><code>logical_not</code> Issue</a></h4>
<p>David Robins is having fun with <code>logical_not</code> and Ruby. The issue is
that <em>all</em> integers in Ruby are true, whether or not they are zero
but that with some of the assumptions in other PMCs. Robin offered 3
suggestions for how to fix it. Dan noted that it's an issue for Perl 6,
too, since the truth or otherwise of a value can be modified by a
property of that value, coming up with a fix is on his to-do
list. David wondered whether this had been discussed before and offered
another possible way forward. Dan half liked the idea but noted that
the approach didn't work for <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code>, at least where
Perl is concerned.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=Pine.LNX.4.44.0212031513290.16321-100000%40davidrobins.net">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>


<h4><a name="the_language_that_dare_not_speak_its_name.">The Language That Dare Not Speak Its Name</a></h4>
<p>After a fortnight, during which nobody made any comment on Leon
Brocard's patch adding a <em>brainfuck</em> subdirectory to the <em>languages</em>
directory, Nicholas Clark committed it in CVS.</p>
<p>At which point, Andy Dougherty spoke up to say he wasn't happy about
it, saying that he didn't wish to be associated with needlessly crude
and offensive language. After some further debate, the subdirectory was
renamed to <em>bf</em> in such a way that, if you ask CVS it will tell you
that the <em>brainfuck</em> subdirectory does not exist now and never has
existed. Which seems strangely appropriate somehow. Fnord.</p>

<h4><a name="parrot_organization">Parrot Organization</a></h4>
<p>Michael Collins asked about the structure of the Parrot development
organization, and Dan provided some answers. My favorite Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>Q. Is there any formal structure to this organization.</p>
<p>A. I [Dan] delude myself into thinking I'm more or less in charge ... .</p>

<h4><a name="just_when_you_thought_it_was_safe">Just When You Thought It Was Safe ... </a></h4>
<p>to start using long file names with impunity, Mr. Nobody pointed out
that a bunch of the files in the Parrot repository didn't play well
with the MS-DOS 'filesystem's 8.3 naming rules. &quot;So what?&quot; asked Aldo
Calpini. Mr. Nobody asked if DOS was an intended compilation
target. Answer: &quot;No&quot;. The consensus appears to be &quot;Ha! We laugh at
your crappy filename restrictions and will not be jumping through any
hoops to deal with a faintly silly hypothetical target.&quot; Or maybe
that's just my opinion dressed up as consensus. Ah well, if I'm wrong, then
I'm sure someone will tell me.</p>

<h3><a name="meanwhile,_over_in_perl6language">Meanwhile, Over in perl6-language</a></h3>
<p>The perl6-documentation team have been discussing String literals and
their discussion spilled over into perl6-language as there are
several things about them that are undefined and needed discussing by
the language crowd. It's all to do with how octal numbers and octal
string escapes are specified. Essentially, people don't like the
current Perl5/C style <code>0101</code> (octal number) and <code>\101</code> (octal string
escape), so James supplied a list of the other possibilities. (The
current Numeric literals doc say that <code>0c101</code> designates an octal
numeric literal, but then the consistent extension to string literals
(<code>\c101</code> clashes with the current method of specifying a
control-char). After some debate, Larry pulled one of
his gloriously clear posts out of the bag, sketching the issues and
coming up with a straightforward and obvious (but only with hindsight)
way forward. It's good to be reminded why we trust Larry. Anyway, it
turns out that an octal number will be specified using <code>0o101</code> and an
octal character escape will probably be one of <code>\0o[101]</code> or
<code>\c[0o101]</code> (I like the second better...)</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3DED40AF.8010909%40mastros.biz">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20021204202101.GA7347%40wall.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>


<h4><a name="thinking_about_\c[...]">Thinking about <code>\c[...]</code></a></h4>
<p>Once Larry had pulled <code>\c[0o101]</code> out of the bag, it fell to David
Whipp to wonder what you could get up to with it. For instance, could
you do: <code>print &quot;\c[71, 101, 108, 108, 111]&quot;</code> and have that print
&quot;Hello&quot;? Damian pointed out that Larry had already discussed some of
this in Apocalypse 5, but that the separator character would probably
be the semicolon. Then Nicholas Clark got evil, and wondered about
<code>&quot;\c[$(call_a_func())]&quot;</code>, but Damian seemed to think that wouldn't be
such a good idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=F0DF160193C9D511B7110050DA8B7C24572B69%40msexchange.intranet.fast-chip.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p>


<h4><a name="purge:_opposite_of_grep">Purge: Opposite of Grep</a></h4>
<p>Miko O'Sullivan suggested a <code>purge</code> command that would be to <code>grep</code>
as <code>unless</code> is to <code>if</code>. Nobody seemed to like the name that much,
though most seemed to think the idea was sound. Michael Lazzaro
suggested <code>divvy</code> could be used to break a list into multiple
lists (he initially proposed just breaking the list into two lists,
but others extended the idea to more). Damian didn't like the name,
and initially proposed <code>classify</code>, which would return a list of array
references. Discussion continued for a while until Ralph Mellor
suggested <code>part</code> as the name for this putative function, which Damian
leapt on with a glad cry.</p>
<p>This went on for a while, with extra features being proposed and other
explorations of the possibilities including some rather nifty proposed
shorthand/DWIMmery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ken Fox wondered why we couldn't just implement
classify/part/divvy as a normal sub and why everything had to
be built into the first version of Perl 6. So Damian implemented it,
but commented that &quot;then the thousands of people who are apparently
clamoring for this functionality and who would have no hope of
getting the above correct, would have to pull in some module every
time they wanted to partition an array.&quot; Ken was impressed, and asked
for some commentary on how it all worked, which Damian provided. BTW,
this code is <em>really</em> worth looking at for an example of the kind of
power that Perl 6 will provide.</p>
<p>David Wheeler wasn't over keen on calling the function 'part' because
part has so many different possible interpretations. It turns out that
that's why Damian likes the name so much.</p>

<h4><a name="in_defence_of_zeroindexed_arrays">In Defense of Zero-Indexed Arrays</a></h4>
<p>Michael G. Schwern asked people to `explain how having indexes in Perl
6 start at zero will benefit most users. Do not invoke
legacy.' Answers ranged from the silly to the sincere. The best
answer was &quot;Because I [Larry] like it&quot; which, I think, trumps
everyone.</p>

<h4><a name="stringification_of_references">Stringification of References</a></h4>
<p>Joseph F. Ryan kicked off a discussion of the stringification of
objects and references and offered his suggestions. Joseph leans
toward having the default stringifications of objects and references
provide information useful to the programmer. I agree with him (so, if
you spot any bias in the upcoming summary that'd be because I'm
biased). Michael Lazzaro explicitly brought up the distinction between
&quot;stringification for output&quot; and &quot;stringification for debugging&quot;, and
came down in favor of stringification for output (heck, he even
wanted references to be invisible to stringification). Piers Cawley
told him he was wrong and appealed to the authority of Kent Beck
(a Smalltalk and Java programmer, possibly not the <em>best</em> authority
to choose). Michael then proposed a scheme involving subclasses of
String, to provide cues for different stringifications, which John
Siracusa thought was going rather a long way too far, coming down in
favour of the &quot;stringify for debugging&quot; position. I'm not sure
anything has actually been <em>decided</em> yet though. Tune in next week.</p>

<h4><a name="outline_of_class_definitions_in_perl_6">Outline of Class Definitions in Perl 6</a></h4>
<p>Simon Cozens asked for a translation of some Perl 5 style OO code into
Perl 6, and Luke Palmer had a go at the task, then Larry came through
with something a little more definitive (but not <em>actually</em>
definitive just yet, I get the feeling that a few things are still in
flux ... .)</p>

<h4><a name="perl_6_and_set_theory">Perl 6 and Set Theory</a></h4>
<p>Luke Palmer posted a fascinating document presenting a &quot;new way of
thinking about some constructs.&quot; and proposed some changes to help
with consistency. The document covered junctions and classes,
recasting them as representations of finite and infinite sets. Only
Damian responded with a few corrections and clarifications noting
that one of Luke's proposed changes was rather fundamental, and that
he wasn't sure he wanted to make that change without some deep
reflection (from someone) on how that would affect the junction types
that Luke hadn't considered. Discussion continues.</p>

<h3><a name="in_brief">In Brief</a></h3>
<p>Steve Fink is toying with adding OpenGL ops to Parrot.</p>
<p>Leon Brocard has used the native call interface features to add curses
support to Parrot and offered a version of <em>life.pasm</em> that makes use
of it.</p>
<p>The perl6-language crowd are currently working on string literals and
stringification.</p>




<h3><a name="who's_who_in_perl_6">Who's Who in Perl 6?</a></h3>
<p>I'm bumping this one up the questionnaire queue slightly. I felt the
need for some controversy.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_who_are_you%3f">Who are you?</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
Abigail
</dd>


<dt><strong><a name="item_what_do_you_do_for%2fwith_perl_6%3f">What do you do for/with Perl 6?</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
Nothing, except for disliking languages that are white space
sensitive.
</dd>


<dt><strong><a name="item_where_are_you_coming_from%3f">Where are you coming from?</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
I've been coding Perl since 1995. Joined p5p in 1996 or so.
</dd>


<dt><strong><a name="item_when_do_you_think_perl_6_will_be_released%3f">When do you think Perl 6 will be released?</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
A usable release? Given the current rate in which apocalypses are
produced, I'd say 2008. Give or take a few years.
</dd>


<dt><strong><a name="item_why_are_you_doing_this%3f">Why are you doing this?</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
I adore Perl. Perl5 that is. Programming in Perl5 is like exploring a
large medieval castle, surrounded by a dark, mysterious forest, with
something new and unexpected around each corner. There are dragons to
be conquered, maidens to be rescued, and holy grails to be quested
for. Lots of fun. Perl6 looks like a Louis-XVI castle and garden to
me. Straight, symmetric, and bright. There are wigs to be powdered,
minuets to be danced, all quite boring. I haven't been impressed by
new features yet, but I'm disappointed by what will be lost.
</dd>


<dt><strong><a name="item_you_have_5_words%2e_describe_yourself%2e">You have 5 words. Describe yourself.</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
My mind is twisted. Backwards.
</dd>


<dt><strong><a name="item_do_you_have_anything_to_declare%3f">Do you have anything to declare?</a></strong>

</dt>
<dd>
One of the great things about Perl5 is that I don't have to declare
anything I don't want to.

<h3><a name="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h3>
<p>Another week of writing on the train and, for a change of scenery, at
my parents' house, fuelled, as usual by large amounts of tea.</p>
<p>Proofreading was once again down to Aspell and me. Any errors this
week are probably my fault, it's about time I started accepting my
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has sent me questionnaire answers, I've got a
queue of about four left so, if you work with Perl 6 (or, like Abigail,
hate it) please answer the same set of questions Abigail just answered
and send them to me at <em><a href="mailto:mailto:5Ws@bofh.org.uk">mailto:5Ws@bofh.org.uk</a></em>. Thanks.</p>
<p>I got some mail last week from someone praising me for the summaries
(thanks), but wanting to know how he could contribute his time and
energy, so this week the chorus has a few extra lines in it:</p>
<p>If you didn't like the summary, what are you doing still reading it?
If you did like it, please consider one or more of the following
options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Send money to the Perl Foundation at
<a href="http://donate/perl-foundation.org/">http://donate/perl-foundation.org/</a> and help support the ongoing
development of Perl 6.</li>


<li>
Get involved with the Perl 6 process. The mailing lists are open to
everyone, <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6">http://dev.perl.org/perl6</a> and
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/parrot">http://dev.perl.org/parrot</a> are good starting points with links to
the appropriate mailing lists.</li>

<li>Send feedback, flames, money and or lucrative employment in the
Doncaster area to <em><a href="mailto:mailto:p6summarizer@bofh.org.uk">mailto:p6summarizer@bofh.org.uk</a></em> (No, I'm not
unemployed at the moment, I just want to work nearer to home...)</li>

</ul>
<p>The fee paid for publication of these summaries on perl.com is paid
directly to the Perl Foundation.</p>
