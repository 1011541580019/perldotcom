<h3><code>s/(?&lt;!SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE )FOOT/HEAD/g</code>
</h3>

<p>Most of us have tried at one time or another to use regular expressions to do things we shouldn't: parsing HTML, obfuscating code, washing dishes, etc. This is what the technical term "showing off" means. I've done it too:</p>

<pre><code>$html =~ s{
             (&lt;a\s(?:[^&gt;](?!href))*href\s*)
             (&amp;(&amp;[^;]+;)?(?:.(?!\3))+(?:\3)?)
             ([^&gt;]+&gt;)
          }
          {$1 . decode_entities($2) .  $4}gsexi;</code></pre>

<p>I was strutting like a peacock when I wrote that, followed quickly by eating crow when I ran it. I never did get that working right. I'm still not sure what I was trying to do. That regular expression forced me to learn how to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/HTML::TokeParser"><code>HTML::TokeParser</code></a>. More importantly, that was the regular expression that taught me how difficult regular expressions can be.</p>

<h4>The Problem with Regular Expressions</h4>

<p>Look at that regex again:</p>

<pre><code> /(&lt;a\s(?:[^&gt;](?!href))*href\s*)(&amp;(&amp;[^;]+;)?(?:.(?!\3))+(?:\3)?)([^&gt;]+&gt;)/</code></pre>

<!-- sidebar begins -->
 <csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/754" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<!-- sidebar ends -->

<p>Do you know that matches? Exactly? Are you <em>sure</em>? Even if it works, how easily can you modify it? If you don't know what it was trying to do (and to be fair, don't forget it's broken), how long did you spend trying to figure it out? When's the last time a single line of code gave you such fits?</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that this regular expression is trying to do far more work than a single line of code is likely to do. When facing with a regular expression like that, there are a few things I like to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Document it carefully.</li>

<li>Use the <code>/x</code> switch so I can expand it over several lines.</li>

<li>Possibly, encapsulate it in a subroutine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, though, there's a fourth option: <em>lexing</em>.</p>

<h4>Lexing</h4>

<p>When developing code, we typically take a problem and break it down into a series of smaller problems that are easier to solve. Regular expressions are code and you can break them down into a series of smaller problems that are easier to solve. One technique is to use lexing to facilitate this.</p>

<p>Lexing is the act of breaking data down into discrete tokens and assigning meaning to those tokens. There's a bit of fudging in that statement, but it pretty much covers the basics.</p>

<p>Parsing typically follows lexing to convert the tokens into something more useful. Parsing is frequently the domain of some tool that applies a well-defined grammar to the lexed tokens.</p>

<p>Sometimes well-defined grammars are not practical for extracting and reporting information. There might not be a grammar available for a company's ad-hoc log file format. Other times you might find it easier to process the tokens manually then to spend the time writing a grammar. Still other times you might only care about part of the data you've lexed, not all of it. All three of these reasons apply to some problems.</p>

<h4>Parsing SQL</h4>

<p>Recently, on Perlmonks (<a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=472684">parse a query string</a>), someone had some SQL to parse:</p>

<pre><code>select the_date as "date",
round(months_between(first_date,second_date),0) months_old
,product,extract(year from the_date) year
,case
  when a=b then 'c'
  else 'd'
  end tough_one
from ...
where ...</code></pre>

<p>The poster needed the alias for each column from that SQL. In this case, the aliases are <code>date</code>, <code>months_old</code>, <code>product</code>, <code>year</code>, and <code>tough_one</code>. Of course, this was only one example. There's actually plenty of generated SQL, all with subtle variations on the column aliases, so this is not a trivial task. What's interesting about this, though, is that we don't give a fig about anything except the column aliases. The rest of the text is merely there to help us find those aliases.</p>

<p>Your first thought might be to parse this with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/SQL::Statement"><code>SQL::Statement</code></a>. As it turns out, this module does not handle <code>CASE</code> statements. Thus, you must figure out how to patch <code>SQL::Statement</code>, submit said patch, and hope it gets accepted and released in a timely fashion. (Note that <code>SQL::Statement</code> uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/SQL::Parser"><code>SQL::Parser</code></a>, so the latter is also not an option.)</p>

<p>Second, many of us have worked in environments where we have problems to solve in production <em>now</em>, but we still have to wait three weeks to get the necessary modules installed, if we can get them approved at all.</p>

<p>The most important reason, though, is even if <code>SQL::Statement</code> could handle this problem, this would be an awfully short article if you used it instead of a lexer.</p>













<h4>Lexing Basics</h4>

<p>As mentioned earlier, lexing is essentially the task of analyzing data and breaking it down into a series of easy-to-use tokens. While the data may be in other forms, usually this means analyzing strings. To give a trivial example, consider the expression:</p>

<pre><code>x = (3 + 2) / y</code></pre>

<p>When lexed, you might get a series of tokens, such as:</p>

<pre><code>my @tokens = (
  [ OP  =&gt; 'x' ],
  [ OP  =&gt; '=' ],
  [ OP  =&gt; '(' ],
  [ INT =&gt; '3' ],
  [ VAR =&gt; '+' ],
  [ INT =&gt; '2' ],
  [ OP  =&gt; ')' ],
  [ OP  =&gt; '/' ],
  [ VAR =&gt; 'y' ],
);</code></pre>

<p>With a proper grammar, you could then read this series of tokens and take actions based upon their values, perhaps to build a simple language interpreter or translate this code into another programming language. Even without a grammar, you can find these tokens useful.</p>

<h4>Identifying Tokens</h4>

<p>The first step in building a lexer is identifying the tokens you wish to parse. Look again at the SQL.</p>

<pre><code>select the_date as "date",
round(months_between(first_date,second_date),0) months_old
,product,extract(year from the_date) year
,case
  when a=b then 'c'
    else 'd'
  end tough_one
from ...
where ...</code></pre>

<p>There's nothing really to care about anything after the <code>from</code> keyword. In looking at this closer, everything you do care about is immediately prior to a comma or the <code>from</code> keyword. However, splitting on commas isn't enough, as there are some commas embedded in function parentheses.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to identify the various things you can match with simple regular expressions.</p>

<p>These "things" appear to be parentheses, commas, operators, keywords, and random text. A first pass at it might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $lparen  = qr/\(/;
my $rparen  = qr/\)/;
my $keyword = qr/(?i:select|from|as)/; # this is all this problem needs
my $comma   = qr/,/;
my $text    = qr/(?:\w+|'\w+'|"\w+")/;
my $op      = qr{[-=+*/&lt;&gt;]};</code></pre>

<p>The text matching is somewhat naive and you might want <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Regexp::Common"><code>Regexp::Common</code></a> for some of the regular expressions, but keep this simple for now.</p>

<p>The operators are a bit more involved. Assume that some SQL might have math statements embedded in them.</p>

<p>Now create the actual lexer. One way to do this is to make your own. It might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sub lexer {
    my $sql = shift;
    return sub {
        LEXER: {
            return ['KEYWORD', $1] if $sql =~ /\G ($keyword) /gcx;
            return ['COMMA',   ''] if $sql =~ /\G ($comma)   /gcx;
            return ['OP',      $1] if $sql =~ /\G ($op)      /gcx;
            return ['PAREN',    1] if $sql =~ /\G $lparen    /gcx;
            return ['PAREN',   -1] if $sql =~ /\G $rparen    /gcx;
            return ['TEXT',    $1] if $sql =~ /\G ($text)    /gcx;
            redo LEXER             if $sql =~ /\G \s+        /gcx;
        }
    };
}

my $lexer = lexer($sql);

while (defined (my $token = $lexer-&gt;())) {
    # do something with the token
}</code></pre>

<p>Without going into the detail of how that works, it's fair to say that this is not the best solution. By looking at <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=472701">the original Perlmonks post</a>, you should find that you need to make two passes through the data to extract what you want. I've left the explanation an exercise for the reader.</p>













<p>To make this simpler, use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/HOP::Lexer"><code>HOP::Lexer</code></a> module from the CPAN. This module, described by Mark Jason Dominus in his book <em>Higher Order Perl</em>, makes creating lexers a rather trivial task and makes them a bit more powerful than the example. Here's the new code:</p>

<pre><code>use HOP::Lexer 'make_lexer';
my @sql   = $sql;
my $lexer = make_lexer(
    sub { shift @sql },
    [ 'KEYWORD', qr/(?i:select|from|as)/          ],
    [ 'COMMA',   qr/,/                            ],
    [ 'OP',      qr{[-=+*/]}                      ],
    [ 'PAREN',   qr/\(/,      sub { [shift,  1] } ],
    [ 'PAREN',   qr/\)/,      sub { [shift, -1] } ],
    [ 'TEXT',    qr/(?:\w+|'\w+'|"\w+")/, \&amp;text  ],
    [ 'SPACE',   qr/\s*/,     sub {}              ],
);

sub text {
    my ($label, $value) = @_;
    $value =~ s/^["']//;
    $value =~ s/["']$//;
    return [ $label, $value ];
}</code></pre>

<p>This certainly doesn't look any easier to read, but bear with me.</p>

<p>The <code>make_lexer</code> subroutine takes as its first argument an iterator, which returns the text to match on every call. In this case, you only have one snippet of text to match, so merely shift it off of an array. If you were reading lines from a log file, the iterator would be quite handy.</p>

<p>After the first argument comes a series of array references. Each reference takes two mandatory and one optional argument(s):</p>

<pre><code>[ $label, $pattern, $optional_subroutine ]</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$label</code> is the name of the token. The pattern should match whatever the label identifies. The third argument, a subroutine reference, takes as arguments the label and the <em>text</em> the label matched, and returns whatever you wish for a token.</p>

<p>Consider how you typically use the <code>make_lexer</code> subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>[ 'KEYWORD', qr/(?i:select|from|as)/ ],</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of how to transform the data before making the token:</p>

<pre><code>[ 'TEXT', qr/(?:\w+|'\w+'|"\w+")/, \&amp;text  ],</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned previously, the regular expression might be naive, but leave that for now and focus on the <code>&amp;text</code> subroutine.</p>

<pre><code>sub text {
    my ($label, $value) = @_;
    $value =~ s/^["']//;
    $value =~ s/["']$//;
    return [ $label, $value ];
}</code></pre>

<p>This says, "Take the label and the value, strip leading and trailing quotes from the value and return them in an array reference."</p>

<p>To strip the white space you don't care about, simply return nothing:</p>

<pre><code> 'SPACE', qr/\s*/, sub {} ],</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have your lexer, put it to work. Remember that column aliases are the <code>TEXT</code> not in parentheses, but immediately prior to commas or the <code>from</code> keyword. How do we know if you're inside of parentheses? Cheat a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>[ 'PAREN', qr/\(/, sub { [shift,  1] } ],
[ 'PAREN', qr/\)/, sub { [shift, -1] } ],</code></pre>

<p>With that, you can add a one whenever you get to an opening parenthesis and subtract it when you get to a closing one. Whenever the result is zero, you know that you're outside of parentheses.</p>

<p>To get the tokens, call the <code>$lexer</code> iterator repeatedly.</p>

<pre><code>while ( defined (my $token = $lexer-&gt;() ) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>The tokens look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[  'KEYWORD',      'select' ]
[  'TEXT',       'the_date' ]
[  'KEYWORD',          'as' ]
[  'TEXT',           'date' ]
[  'COMMA',             ',' ]
[  'TEXT',          'round' ]
[  'PAREN',               1 ]
[  'TEXT', 'months_between' ]
[  'PAREN',               1 ]</code></pre>

<p>And so on.</p>













<p>Here's how to process the tokens:</p>

<pre><code> 1:  my $inside_parens = 0;
 2:  while ( defined (my $token = $lexer-&gt;()) ) {
 3:      my ($label, $value) = @$token;
 4:      $inside_parens += $value if 'PAREN' eq $label;
 5:      next if $inside_parens || 'TEXT' ne $label;
 6:      if (defined (my $next = $lexer-&gt;('peek'))) {
 7:          my ($next_label, $next_value) = @$next;
 8:          if ('COMMA' eq $next_label) {
 9:              print "$value\n";
10:          }
11:          elsif ('KEYWORD' eq $next_label &amp;&amp; 'from' eq $next_value) {
12:              print "$value\n";
13:              last; # we're done
14:          }
15:      }
16:  }</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty straightforward, but there are some tricky bits. Each token is a two-element array reference, so line 3 makes the label and value fairly explicit. Lines 4 and 5 use the "cheat" for handling parentheses. Line 5 also skips anything that isn't text and therefore cannot be a column alias.</p>

<p>Line 6 is a bit odd. In <code>HOP::Lexer</code>, passing the string <code>peek</code> to the lexer will return the next token without actually advancing the <code>$lexer</code> iterator. From there, it's straightforward logic to find out if the value is a column alias that matches the criteria.</p>

<p>Putting all of this together makes:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use HOP::Lexer 'make_lexer';

my $sql = &lt;&lt;END_SQL;
select the_date as "date",
round(months_between(first_date,second_date),0) months_old
,product,extract(year from the_date) year
,case
  when a=b then 'c'
    else 'd'
      end tough_one
      from XXX
END_SQL

my @sql   = $sql;
my $lexer = make_lexer(
    sub { shift @sql },
    [ 'KEYWORD', qr/(?i:select|from|as)/          ],
    [ 'COMMA',   qr/,/                            ],
    [ 'OP',      qr{[-=+*/]}                      ],
    [ 'PAREN',   qr/\(/,      sub { [shift,  1] } ],
    [ 'PAREN',   qr/\)/,      sub { [shift, -1] } ],
    [ 'TEXT',    qr/(?:\w+|'\w+'|"\w+")/, \&amp;text  ],
    [ 'SPACE',   qr/\s*/,     sub {}              ],
);

sub text {
    my ( $label, $value ) = @_;
    $value =~ s/^["']//;
    $value =~ s/["']$//;
    return [ $label, $value ];
}

my $inside_parens = 0;
while ( defined ( my $token = $lexer-&gt;() ) ) {
    my ( $label, $value ) = @$token;
    $inside_parens += $value if 'PAREN' eq $label;
    next if $inside_parens || 'TEXT' ne $label;
    if ( defined ( my $next = $lexer-&gt;('peek') ) ) {
        my ( $next_label, $next_value ) = @$next;
        if ( 'COMMA' eq $next_label ) {
            print "$value\n";
        }
        elsif ( 'KEYWORD' eq $next_label &amp;&amp; 'from' eq $next_value ) {
            print "$value\n";
            last; # we're done
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>That prints out the column aliases:</p>

<pre><code>date
months_old
product
year
tough_one</code></pre>

<p>So are you done? No, probably not. What you really need now are many other examples of the SQL generated in the first problem statement. Maybe the <code>&amp;text</code> subroutine is naive. Maybe there are other operators you forgot. Maybe there are floating-point numbers embedded in the SQL. When you have to lex data by hand, fine-tuning the lexer to match your actual data can take a few tries.</p>

<p>It's also important to note that precedence is very important here. <code>&amp;make_lexer</code> evaluates each array reference passed in the order it receives them. If you passed the <code>TEXT</code> array reference before the <code>KEYWORD</code> array reference, the <code>TEXT</code> regular expression would match keywords before the <code>KEYWORD</code> could, thus generating spurious results.</p>

<p>Happy lexing!</p>

            <p>Richard Gabriel of Sun Microsystems suggests that <a href="http://java.sun.com/features/2002/11/gabriel_qa.html">beginning programmers should study the source code for great works of software</a> as part of a <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/MFASoftware.html">Master of Fine Arts course in software</a>. Prominent Extreme Programmers talk about finding the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?QualityWithoutaName">Quality Without a Name</a> in software, listening to your code, and reworking your code when it "smells."</p>

<p>With this in mind, this article contains a review of one of the "base" Perl modules, available from CPAN but also included as part of any distribution of Perl. It's a module that I particularly like (with algorithms that I can more or less understand); I aim to show why I like it and what you can learn from it.</p>

<h3>Code and Communication</h3>

<p>Reviewing (even reading) source code is not always easy. Most software
doesn't have human readability as a primary goal &#8212; just compilers or
interpreters.  The exception is software written as examples or to help others
learn. This code is primarily of interest in itself and not for what it does.
As far as a computer cares, software would have the same behavior if it had no
comments and all variables named as <code>a1, a2, ...</code> -- as the
obfuscated programming contests prove.  They also prove that we humans then
find it difficult to read. Most literature (including poems, essays, short
stories, novels), on the other hand, has the primary purpose of communicating
with other people, and so is often easier to understand.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, code reviews are still useful. Projects that perform them
usually do so to find bugs or to suggest improvements; they exist for the
benefit of the code writer or tester. Here, we seek to learn from the code, to
take away from it lessons that we can apply to our own code. These are lessons,
or patterns, but not design patterns; the patterns discussed here appear at a
lower level and are more of the order of tips and tricks.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, there are parts of software programs that do exist to
communicate: comments as well as variable and function (or method) names are all about
communicating (with other people).  The challenge for the considerate <a href="#codemaintainer">[1]</a> software developer (who thinks beyond the short term) is to use comments and names to tell the story of the software: what it
is, what it should do, and why the developers made certain choices.  Ideally,
the form of software should match its function <a href="#camel">[2]</a>:
comments and names should explain and clarify the rest of the code, rather than
disagreeing with it, repeating what it says, or being irrelevant. Source code
reviews are part of this process.  They further explain the code to a wider
audience, telling its story in a broader and hopefully deeper way.</p>

<h3>The Review Itself</h3>

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::Complex">Math::Complex</a> is
an open source Perl package that is part of the core Perl distribution. It
provides methods for complex arithmetic (and overloading of operators).</p>

<p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RaphaelManfredi">Raphael Manfredi</a> created the module in 1996. Since then, first <a href="http://www.hut.fi/~jhi/">Jarkko Hietaniemi</a> and, currently, <a href="http://www.prairienet.org/~dslewart/">Daniel S.  Lewart</a> have maintained it (according to its own comments). My comments below relate to version 1.34.</p>

<p>I should explain that while I've been using Perl for maybe three years, it's
mostly been for test automation and text processing; my day-to-day programming
is primarily in C. I tend to notice the things about Perl that are difficult
(at times verging on impossible) to do in C.</p>

<p>Early on in the <code>Math::Complex</code> package, a huge (and often reused) regular
expression <code>$gre</code> appears:</p>

<pre><code># Regular expression for floating point numbers.
my $gre =
qr'\s*([\+\-]?(?:(?:(?:\d+(?:_\d+)*(?:\.\d*(?:_\d+)*)?|\.\d+(?:_\d+)*)(?:[eE][\+\-]?\d+(?:_\d+)*)?)))';</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression captures floating-point numbers (which may include
isolated underscores) in a single reference. It thus provides flexibility and
robustness (key motivations for using regular expressions) without repetition.
It also uses <code>?:</code> within the brackets to cluster parts of the
regular expression without providing back references; this means that the whole
regular expression provides one back reference rather than five or six.</p>

<p>This regular expression may be easier to understand when refactored into
smaller chunks. The test I used when refactoring was quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>my @testexpressions = ('100', '100.12', '100.12e-13', '100_000.545_123',
	'1e-3', '.1', '-100_000.545_123e+11_12');
foreach my $expr (@testexpressions)
{
   if ($expr =~ m/$gre/)
   {
      print "$expr matches gre\n";
   }
}</code></pre>

<p>The same test code can run against the refactored regular expression to make
sure that it still matches the same strings.  Here, working from the inside
out, I extracted some common expressions. For each expression extracted and
captured by the quote-like operator <code>qr</code>, I also removed the
<code>?:</code> clustering. <code>$gre</code> above is equivalent to
<code>$newgre</code> below:</p>

<pre><code>my $underscoredigits = qr/_\d+/;
my $digitstring      = qr/\d+$underscoredigits*/;
my $fractional       = qr/\.\d*$underscoredigits*/;
my $mantissa         = qr/$digitstring$fractional?|\.$digitstring/;
my $exponent         = qr/[eE][\+\-]?$digitstring/;
my $newgre           = qr/\s*([\+\-]?$mantissa$exponent?)/;</code></pre>

<p> For example, <code>$underscoredigits</code> matches <code>_123</code>;
<code>$digitstring</code> matches <code>545_123</code>;
<code>$fractional</code> matches <code>.545_123</code>; <code>$mantissa</code>
matches either <code>100_000.545_123</code> or <code>.1</code>;
<code>$exponent</code> matches <code>e+11_12</code>; and finally
<code>$newgre</code> matches the whole string
<code>-100_000.545_123e+11_12</code>.</p>

<p>The construction method <code>make</code> is, again, flexible and robust.
The author has extracted part of its complexity to different methods to avoid
repetition. For example, the module uses the <code>_cannot_make</code> function
internally to report errors, calling it from several places in
<code>make</code>. It looks like:</p>

<pre><code># Die on bad *make() arguments.

sub _cannot_make {
    die "@{[(caller(1))[3]]}: Cannot take $_[0] of $_[1].\n";
}</code></pre>

<p>In turn, it calls the built-in <code>caller</code> function to refer back to
the original code (similar to an <code>assert</code> in C, or a lightweight
version of the <code>cluck</code> or <code>confess</code> functions in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.5/lib/Carp.pm">Carp</a> package).</p>

<p><code>make</code> also calls the the <code>remake</code> function, if
<code>make</code> receives only one argument (for example, a string such as
<code>"1 + 2i"</code>) and must deduce the real and/or imaginary parts:</p>

<pre><code>sub _remake {
    my $arg = shift;
    my ($made, $p, $q);

    if ($arg =~ /^(?:$gre)?$gre\s*i\s*$/) {
        ($p, $q) = ($1 || 0, $2);
        $made = 'cart';
    } elsif ($arg =~ /^\s*\[\s*$gre\s*(?:,\s*$gre\s*)?\]\s*$/) {
        ($p, $q) = ($1, $2 || 0);
        $made = 'exp';
    }

    if ($made) {
        $p =~ s/^\+//;
        $q =~ s/^\+//;
    }

    return ($made, $p, $q);
}</code></pre>

<p>The regular expression <code>$gre</code> appears here as part of a larger
regular expression, to interpret not only <code>"1 + 2i"</code> but also
<code>"2i"</code> by itself. The expression <code>$1 || 0</code>, used here and
elsewhere, replaces the <code>undef</code> value of Perl (treated as 0 in a
Boolean context) with 0, while leaving other values unchanged.</p>

<p>The <code>plus</code> function, one of the several binary operators provided
in the package, also has some interesting features:</p>

<pre><code>#
# (plus)
#
# Computes z1+z2.
#
sub plus {
        my ($z1, $z2, $regular) = @_;
        my ($re1, $im1) = @{$z1-&gt;cartesian};
        $z2 = cplx($z2) unless ref $z2;
        my ($re2, $im2) = ref $z2 ? @{$z2-&gt;cartesian} : ($z2, 0);
        unless (defined $regular) {
                $z1-&gt;set_cartesian([$re1 + $re2, $im1 + $im2]);
                return $z1;
        }
        return (ref $z1)-&gt;make($re1 + $re2, $im1 + $im2);
}</code></pre>

<p>It uses the trinary conditional operator <code>* = * ? * : *</code>, which
is also present in C. In Perl, this can return not just scalars but also lists.
Thus the code to calculate the values of <code>$re2</code> and
<code>$im2</code> is much more compact than the equivalent code in C could be.
This code uses the Cartesian coordinates of <code>$z2</code> if it's already a
complex number.  Otherwise, it turns a real number into a complex number.</p>

<p>The <code>plus</code> function later uses <code>ref $z1</code>, the package
name of <code>$z1</code>, to create the sum of <code>$z1</code> and
<code>$z2</code>; this allows subclasses of Math::Complex to reuse exactly the
same function.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>Cartesian</code> function mentioned above can either
return existing values for the real and imaginary part, if these are "clean"
(valid), or recalculate them from the polar form.  Each complex number object
stores the "cleanliness" (validity) of its Cartesian values, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sub cartesian {$_[0]-&gt;{c_dirty} ?
        $_[0]-&gt;update_cartesian : $_[0]-&gt;{'cartesian'}}</code></pre>

<p>This is a neat trick to avoid recalculating Cartesian coordinates when it's
not necessary.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <code>Math::Complex</code> package is not only useful, but efficient, robust, and
flexible. It does use brief variable names, but this is traditional in
mathematics; given that it uses complicated (or at least long) expressions,
this means that the full expression is easy to understand (or read aloud). The
functions themselves tend also to be brief and easy to understand.</p>

<p>We see here the benefits of reuse and refactoring. Over 8 years and 34
versions of this code, it has no doubt seen heavy rewriting, to the point of
perhaps each line being different from the corresponding line in version 1.1
(or 0.1!). This extended refactoring has removed unnecessary and repeated code,
clarified comments and usage, and led to clear and clean code. It provides an
example not only of how to write a mathematical package in Perl, using regular
expressions and references as described above, but also of what code can look
like. That is perhaps its best lesson.</p>

<p>For some, regular expressions provide the chainsaw functionality of
the much-touted Perl "Swiss Army knife" metaphor.  They are powerful,
fast, and very sharp, but like real chainsaws, can be dangerous when
used without appropriate safety measures. </p>

<p>In this article I'll
discuss the issues associated with using heavy-duty, contractor-grade
regular expressions, and demonstrate a few maintenance techniques to
keep these chainsaws in proper condition for safe and effective
long-term use.</p>

<h3>Readability: Whitespace and Comments</h3>

<p>Before getting into any deep issues, I want to cover the number one
rule of shop safety: use whitespace to format your regular
expressions.  Most of us already honor this wisdom in our various
coding styles (though perhaps not with the zeal of Python developers).
But more of us could make better, judicious use of whitespace in our
regular expressions, via the <code>/x</code> modifier.  Not only does
it improve readability, but allows us to add meaningful, explanatory
comments.  For example, this simple regular expression:</p>

<pre><code># matching "foobar" is critical here ...
  $_ =~ m/foobar/;</code></pre>

<p>Could be rewritten, using a trailing <code>/x</code> modifier,
as:</p>

<pre><code>$_ =~ m/ foobar    # matching "foobar" is critical here ...
         /x;</code></pre>

<p>Now, in this example you might argue that readability wasn't
improved at all; I guess that's the problem with triviality.  Here's
another, slightly less trivial example that also illustrates the need
to escape literal whitespace and comment characters when using
the <code>/x</code> modifier:</p>

<pre><code>$_ =~ m/^                         # anchor at beginning of line
          The\ quick\ (\w+)\ fox    # fox adjective
          \ (\w+)\ over             # fox action verb
          \ the\ (\w+) dog          # dog adjective
          (?:                       # whitespace-trimmed comment:
            \s* \# \s*              #   whitespace and comment token
            (.*?)                   #   captured comment text; non-greedy!
            \s*                     #   any trailing whitespace
          )?                        # this is all optional
          $                         # end of line anchor
         /x;                        # allow whitespace</code></pre>

<p>This regular expression successfully matches the following lines of
input:</p>

<pre><code>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
The quick red fox bounded over the sleeping dog
The quick black fox slavered over the dead dog   # a bit macabre, no?</code></pre>

<p>While embedding meaningful explanatory comments in your regular
expressions can only help readability and maintenance, many of us
don't like the plethora of backslashed spaces made necessary by the
"global" <code>/x</code> modifier.  Enter the "locally"
acting <code>(?#)</code> and <code>(?x:)</code> embedded
modifiers:</p>

<pre><code>$_ =~ m/^(?#                      # anchor at beginning of line

          )The quick (\w+) fox (?#  # fox adjective
          )(\w+) over (?#           # fox action verb
          )the (\w+) dog(?x:        # dog adjective
                                    # optional, trimmed comment:
            \s*                     #   leading whitespace
            \# \s* (.*?)            #   comment text
            \s*                     #   trailing whitespace

          )?$(?#                    # end of line anchor
          )/;</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the <code>(?#)</code> embedded modifier was used to
introduce our commentary between each set of whitespace-sensitive
textual components; the non-capturing parentheses
construct <code>(?:)</code> used for the optional comment text was
also altered to include a locally-acting <code>x</code> modifier.  No
backslashing was necessary, but it's a bit harder to quickly
distinguish relevant whitespace.  To each their own, YMMV, TIMTOWTDI,
etc.; the fact is, both commented examples are probably easier to
maintain than:</p>

<pre><code># match the fox adjective and action verb, then the dog adjective,
  # and any optional, whitespace-trimmed commentary:
  $_ =~ m/^The quick (\w+) fox (\w+) over the (\w+) dog(?:\s*#\s*(.*?)\s*$/;</code></pre>

<p>This example, while well-commented and clear at first, quickly
deteriorates into the nearly unreadable "line noise" that gives Perl
programmers a bad name and makes later maintenance difficult.</p>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/834" template="b/article_sidebar2.view">

<p>So, as in other programming languages, use whitespace formatting
and commenting as appropriate, or maybe even when it seems like
overkill; it can't hurt.  And like the choice between alternative code
indentation and bracing styles, Perl regular expressions allow a few
different options (global <code>/x</code> modifier,
local <code>(?#)</code> and <code>(?x:)</code> embedded modifiers) to
suit your particular aesthetics.</p>

<h3>Capturing Parenthesis: Taming the Jungle</h3>

<p>Most of us use regular expressions to actually do something with
the parsed text (although the condition that the input matches the
expressions is also important).  Assigning the captured text from the
previous example is relatively easy: the first three capturing
parentheses are visually distinct and can be clearly
numbered <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> and <code>$3</code>;
however, the extra set of non-capturing parentheses, which provide
optional commentary, themselves have another set of embedded,
capturing parentheses; here's another rewriting of the example, with
slightly less whitespace formatting:</p>

<pre><code>my ($fox, $verb, $dog, $comment);
  if ( $_ =~ m/^                         # anchor at beginning of line
               The\ quick\ (\w+)\ fox    # fox adjective
               \ (\w+)\ over             # fox action verb
               \ the\ (\w+) dog          # dog adjective
               (?:\s* \# \s* (.*?) \s*)? # an optional, trimmed comment
               $                         # end of line anchor
              /x
     ) {
      ($fox, $verb, $dog, $comment) = ($1, $2, $3, $4);
  }</code></pre>

<p>From a quick glance at this code, can you immediately tell whether
the <code>$comment</code> variable will come from <code>$4</code>
or <code>$5</code>?  Will it include the leading <code>#</code>
comment character?  If you are a practiced regular expression
programmer, you probably can answer these questions without
difficulty, at least for this fairly trivial example. But if we could
make <i>this</i> example even clearer, you will hopefully agree
that similarly clarifying some of your more gnarly regular expressions
would be beneficial in the long run.</p>

<p>When regular expressions grow very large, or include more than three pairs of parentheses (capturing or otherwise), a useful clarifying
technique is to embed the capturing assignments directly within the
regular expression, via the code-executing pattern <code>(?{})</code>.
In the embedded code, the special <code>$^N</code> variable, which
holds the contents of the last parenthetical capture, is used to
"inline" any variable assignments; our previous example turns into
this:</p>

<pre><code>my ($fox, $verb, $dog, $comment);
  $_ =~ m/^                               # anchor at beginning of line
          The\ quick\  (\w+)              # fox adjective
                       (?{ $fox  = $^N }) 
          \ fox\       (\w+)              # fox action verb
                       (?{ $verb = $^N })
          \ over\ the\ (\w+)              # dog adjective
                       (?{ $dog  = $^N })
          dog
                                          # optional trimmed comment
            (?:\s* \# \s*                 #   leading whitespace
            (.*?)                         #   comment text
            (?{ $comment = $^N })
            \s*)?                         #   trailing whitespace
          $                               # end of line anchor
         /x;                              # allow whitespace</code></pre>

<p>Now it should be explicitly clear that the <code>$comment</code>
variable will only contain the whitespace-trimmed commentary following
(but not including) the <code>#</code> character.  We also don't have
to worry about numbered
variables <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>,
etc. anymore, since we don't make use of them. This regular expression
can be easily extended to capture other text without rearranging
variable assignments.</p>

<h3>Repeated Execution</h3>

<p>There are a few caveats to using this technique, however; note that
code within <code>(?{})</code> constructs is executed immediately as
the regular expression engine incorporates it into a match. That is,
if the engine backtracks off a parenthetical capture to generate a
successful match that does not include that capture, the associated
<code>(?{})</code> code will have already been executed.  To illustrate, let's
again look at just the capturing pattern for the comment
text <code>(.*?)</code> and let's also add a debugging <code>warn
"$comment\n"</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code># optional trimmed comment
            (?:\s* \# \s*               #   leading whitespace
            (.*?) (?{ $comment = $^N;   #   comment text
                      warn "&gt;&gt;$comment&lt;&lt;\n"
                        if $debug;
                    })
            \s*)?                       #   trailing whitespace
          $                             # end of line anchor</code></pre>

<p>The capturing <code>(.*?)</code> pattern is a non-greedy extension
that will cause the regular expression matching engine to constantly
try to finish the match (looking for any trailing whitespace and the
end of string, <code>$</code>) without extending the <code>.*?</code>
pattern any further.  The upshot of all this is that with debugging
turned on, this input text:</p>

<pre><code>The quick black fox slavered over the dead dog # a bit macabre, no?</code></pre>

<p>Will lead to these debugging statements:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a &lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a b&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a bi&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a bit&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a bit &lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a bit m&lt;&lt;
[ ... ]
&gt;&gt;a bit macabre, n&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a bit macabre, no&lt;&lt;
&gt;&gt;a bit macabre, no?&lt;&lt;</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the adjacent embedded <code>(?{})</code> code gets
executed every time the matching engine "uses" it while trying to
complete the match; because the matching engine may "backtrack" to try
many alternatives, the embedded code will also be executed as many
times.</p>

<p>This multiple execution behavior does raise a few concerns.  If the
embedded code is only performing assignments, via <code>$^N</code>,
there doesn't seem at first to be much of a problem, because each
successive execution overrides any previous assignments, and only the
final, successful execution matters, right?  However, what if the
input text had instead been:</p>

<pre><code>The quick black fox slavered over the dead doggie # a bit macabre, no?</code></pre>

<p>This text should fail to match the regular expression overall
(since "doggie" won't match "dog"), and it does.  But, because the
embedded <code>(?{})</code> code chunks are executed as the match is
evaluated, the <code>$fox</code>, <code>$verb</code>
and <code>$dog</code> variables are successfully assigned; the match
doesn't fail until "doggie" is seen.  Our program might now be more
readable and maintainable, but we've also subtly altered the behavior
of the program.</p>

<p>The second problem is one of performance; what if our assignment
code hadn't simply copied <code>$^N</code> into a variable, but had
instead executed a remote database update?  Repeatedly hitting the
database with meaningless updates may be crippling and inefficient.
However, the behavioral aspects of the database example are even more
frightening: what if the match failed overall, but our updates had
already been executed?  Imagine that instead of an update operation,
our code triggered a new row insert for the comment, inserting
multiple, incorrect comment rows!</p>













<h3>Deferred Execution</h3>

<p>Luckily, Perl's ability to introduce "locally scoped" variables
provides a mechanism to "defer" code execution until an overall
successful match is accomplished.  As the regular expression matching
engine tries alternative matches, it introduces a new, nested scope
for each <code>(?{})</code> block, and, more importantly, it exits a
local scope if a particular match is abandoned for another.  If we
were to write out the code executed by the matching engine as it moved
(and backtracked) through our input, it might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ # introduce new scope
  $fox = $^N;
  { # introduce new scope
    $verb = $^N;
    { # introduce new scope
      $dog = $^N;
      { # introduce new scope
        $comment = $^N;
      } # close scope: failed overall match
      { # introduce new scope
        $comment = $^N;
      } # close scope: failed overall match
      { # introduce new scope
        $comment = $^N;
      } # close scope: failed overall match

      # ...

      { # introduce new scope
        $comment = $^N;
      } # close scope: successful overall match
    } # close scope: successful overall match
  } # close scope: successful overall match
} # close scope: successful overall match</code></pre>

<p>We can use this block-scoping behavior to solve both our altered
behavior and performance issues.  Instead of executing code
immediately within each block, we'll cleverly "bundle" the code up,
save it away on a locally scoped "stack," and only process the code if
and when we get to the end of a successful match:</p>

<pre><code>my ($fox, $verb, $dog, $comment);
  $_ =~ m/(?{
              local @c = ();            # provide storage "stack"
          })
          ^                             # anchor at beginning of line
          The\ quick\  (\w+)            # fox adjective
                       (?{
                           local @c;
                           push @c, sub {
                               $fox = $^N;
                           };
                       })
          \ fox\       (\w+)            # fox action verb
                       (?{
                           local @c = @c;
                           push @c, sub {
                               $verb = $^N;
                           };
                       })
          \ over\ the\ (\w+)            # dog adjective
                       (?{
                           local @c = @c;
                           push @c, sub {
                               $dog = $^N;
                           };
                       })
          dog
                                        # optional trimmed comment
            (?:\s* \# \s*               #   leading whitespace
            (.*?)                       #   comment text
            (?{
                local @c = @c;
                push @c, sub {
                    $comment = $^N;
                    warn "&gt;&gt;$comment&lt;&lt;\n"
                      if $debug;
                };
            })
            \s*)?                       #   trailing whitespace
          $                             # end of line anchor
          (?{
              for (@c) { &amp;$_; }         # execute the deferred code
          })
         /x;                            # allow whitespace</code></pre>

<p>Using subroutine "closures" to package up our code and save them on
a locally defined stack, <code>@c</code>, allows us to defer any
processing until the very end of a successful match. Here's the
matching engine code execution "path":</p>

<pre><code>{ # introduce new scope

  local @c = (); # provide storage "stack"

  { # introduce new scope

    local @c;
    push @c, sub { $fox = $^N; };

    { # introduce new scope

      local @c = @c;
      push @c, sub { $verb = $^N; };

      { # introduce new scope

        local @c = @c;
        push @c, sub { $dog = $^N; };

        { # introduce new scope

          local @c = @c;
          push @c, sub { $comment = $^N; };

        } # close scope; lose changes to @c

        { # introduce new scope

          local @c = @c;
          push @c, sub { $comment = $^N; };

        } # close scope; lose changes to @c

        # ...

        { # introduce new scope

          local @c = @c;
          push @c, sub { $comment = $^N; };

          { # introduce new scope

            for (@c) { &amp;$_; }

          } # close scope

        } # close scope; lose changes to @c
      } # close scope; lose changes to @c
    } # close scope; lose changes to @c
  } # close scope; lose changes to @c
} # close scope; no more @c at all</code></pre>

<p>This last technique is especially wordy; however, given judicious
use of whitespace and well-aligned formatting, this idiom could ease
the maintenance of long, complicated regular expressions.</p>

<p>But, more importantly, <b>it doesn't work</b> as written.  What!?!
Why?  Well, it turns out that Perl's support for code blocks
inside <code>(?{})</code> constructs doesn't support subroutine
closures (even attempting to compile one causes a core dump).  But
don't worry, all is not lost!  Since this is Perl, we can always take
things a step further, and make the hard things easy ...</p>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/754" template="b/article_sidebar2.view">

<h3>Making it Actually Work: <code>use Regexp::DeferredExecution</code></h3>

<p>Though we cannot (yet) compile subroutines within <code>(?{})</code>
constructs, we can manipulate all the other types of Perl variables:
scalars, arrays, and hashes.  So instead of using closures:</p>

<pre><code>m/
    (?{ local @c = (); })
    # ...
    (?{ local @c; push @c, sub { $comment = ^$N; } })
    # ...
    (?{ for (@c) { &amp;$_; } })
   /x</code></pre>

<p>We can instead just package up our <code>$comment = $^N</code> code into
a string, to be executed by an <code>eval</code> statement later:</p>

<pre><code>m/
    (?{ local @c = (); })
    # ...
    (?{ local @c; push @c, [ $^N, q{ $comment = ^$N; } ] })
    # ...
    (?{ for (@c) { $^N = $$[0]; eval $$[1]; } })
   /x</code></pre>

<p>Note that we also had to store away the version of <code>$^N</code> that was
active at the time of the <code>(?{})</code> pattern, because it very
likely will have changed by the end of the match.  We didn't need to do this previously, as we were storing closures that efficiently captured all the local context of the code to be executed.</p>

<p>Well, now this is getting <i>really</i> wordy, and downright ugly
to be honest.  However, through the magic of Perl's overloading
mechanism, we can avoid having to see any of that ugliness, by simply
using the <code>Regexp::DeferredExecution</code> module from CPAN:</p>

<pre><code>use Regexp:DeferredExecution;

  my ($fox, $verb, $dog, $comment);
  $_ =~ m/^                               # anchor at beginning of line
          The\ quick\  (\w+)              # fox adjective
                       (?{ $fox  = $^N }) 
          \ fox\       (\w+)              # fox action verb
                       (?{ $verb = $^N })
          \ over\ the\ (\w+)              # dog adjective
                       (?{ $dog  = $^N })
          dog
                                          # optional trimmed comment
            (?:\s* \# \s*                 #   leading whitespace
            (.*?)
            (?{ $comment = $^N })         #   comment text
            \s*)?                         #   trailing whitespace
          $                               # end of line anchor
         /x;                              # allow whitespace</code></pre>

<p>How does the <code>Regexp::DeferredExecution</code> module perform its magic?  Carefully, of course, but also simply; it just makes the
same alterations to regular expressions that we made manually.  1) An
initiating embedded code pattern is prepended to declare local "stack"
storage. 2) Another embedded code pattern is added at the end of the
expression to execute any code found in the stack (the stack itself is
stored in
<code>@Regexp::DeferredExecution::c</code>, so you shouldn't need to
worry about variable name collisions with your own code).  3) Finally,
any <code>(?{})</code> constructs seen in your regular expressions are
saved away onto a local copy of the stack for later execution.  It
looks a little like this:</p>

<pre><code>package Regexp::DeferredExecution;

use Text::Balanced qw(extract_multiple extract_codeblock);

use overload;

sub import { overload::constant 'qr' =&gt; \&amp;convert; }
sub unimport { overload::remove_constant 'qr'; }

sub convert {

  my $re = shift; 

  # no need to convert regexp's without (?{ &lt;code> }):
  return $re unless $re =~ m/\(\?\{/;

  my @chunks = extract_multiple($re,
                                [ qr/\(\?  # '(?' (escaped)
                                     (?={) # followed by '{' (lookahead)
                                    /x,
                                  \&amp;extract_codeblock
                                ]
                               );

  for (my $i = 1 ; $i &lt; @chunks ; $i++) {
    if ($chunks[$i-1] eq "(?") {
      # wrap all code into a closure and push onto the stack:
      $chunks[$i] =~
        s/\A{ (.*) }\Z/{
          local \@Regexp::DeferredExecution::c;
          push \@Regexp::DeferredExecution::c, [\$^N, q{$1}];
        }/msx;
  }

  $re = join("", @chunks);

  # install the stack storage and execution code:
  $re = "(?{
            local \@Regexp::DeferredExecution::c = (); # the stack
         })$re(?{
            for (\@Regexp::DeferredExecution::c) {
              \$^N = \$\$_[0];  # reinstate \$^N
              eval \$\$_[1];    # execute the code
            }
         })";

  return $re;
}

1;</code></pre>

<p>One caveat of <code>Regexp::DeferredExecution</code> use is that
while execution will occur only once per compiled regular expressions,
the ability to embed regular expressions inside of other regular
expressions will circumvent this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>use Regexp::DeferredExecution;

  # the quintessential foobar/foobaz parser:
  $re = qr/foo
           (?:
              bar (?:{ warn "saw bar!\n"; })
              |
              baz (?:{ warn "saw baz!\n"; })
           )?/x;

  # someone's getting silly now:
  $re2 = qr/ $re
             baroo!
             (?:{ warn "saw foobarbaroo! (or, foobazbaroo!)\n"; })
           /x;

  "foobar" =~ /$re2/;

  __END__
  "saw bar!"
</code></pre>Even though the input text to <code>$re2</code> failed to match, the
deferred code from <code>$re</code> was executed because its pattern
<i>did</i> match successfully.
Therefore, <code>Regexp::DeferredExecution</code> should only be used
with "constant" regular expressions; there is currently no way to
overload dynamic, "interpolated" regular expressions.

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>The <code>Regexp::Fields</code> module provides a much more compact
shorthand for embedded named variable
assignments, <code>(?&lt;varname&gt; <i>pattern</i>)</code>, such that
our example becomes:</p>

<pre><code>use Regexp::Fields qw(my);

  my $rx =
    qr/^                             # anchor at beginning of line
       The\ quick\ (?&lt;fox&gt; \w+)\ fox # fox adjective
       \ (?&lt;verb&gt; \w+)\ over         # fox action verb
       \ the\ (?&lt;dog&gt; \w+) dog       # dog adjective
       (?:\s* \# \s*
          (?&lt;comment&gt; .*?)
       \s*)? # an optional, trimmed comment
       $                             # end of line anchor
      /x;</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this particular example, the <code>my $rx</code>
compilation stanza actually implicitly
declared <code>$fox</code>, <code>$verb</code> etc.  If variable
assignment is all you're ever doing, <code>Regexp::Fields</code> is
all you'll need. If you want to embed more generic code fragments in
your regular expressions, <code>Regexp::DeferredExecution</code> may
be your ticket.</p>

<p>And finally, because in Perl there is always One More Way To Do It,
I'll also demonstrate <code>Regexp::English</code>, a module that
allows you to use regular expressions without actually writing any
regular expressions:</p>

<pre><code>use Regexp::English;

  my ($fox, $verb, $dog, $comment);

  my $rx = Regexp::English-&gt;new
               -&gt; start_of_line
               -&gt; literal('The quick ')

               -&gt; remember(\$fox)
                   -&gt; word_chars
               -&gt; end

               -&gt; literal(' fox ')

               -&gt; remember(\$verb)
                   -&gt; word_chars
               -&gt; end

               -&gt; literal(' over the ')

               -&gt; remember(\$dog)
                   -&gt; word_chars
               -&gt; end

               -&gt; literal(' dog')

               -&gt; optional
                   -&gt; zero_or_more -&gt; whitespace_char -&gt; end
                   -&gt; literal('#')
                   -&gt; zero_or_more -&gt; whitespace_char -&gt; end

                   -&gt; remember(\$comment)
                       -&gt; minimal
                           -&gt; multiple
                               -&gt; word_char
                               -&gt; or
                               -&gt; whitespace_char
                           -&gt; end
                       -&gt; end
                   -&gt; end
                   -&gt; zero_or_more -&gt; whitespace_char -&gt; end
               -&gt;end

               -&gt; end_of_line;

  $rx-&gt;match($_);</code></pre>

<p>I must admit that this last example appeals to my inner-Lispish
self.</p>

workshop of mine that you can take back to your own shop.</p>
