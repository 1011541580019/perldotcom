            <p>
This is a book I have been looking forward to for a long time. Back when
James Tisdall had just finished his <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/begperlbio/">Beginning Perl for
Bioinformatics</a>, I asked him to write an article about <a href="/pub/a/2002/01/02/bioinf.html">how to get into
bioinf</a> from a Perl programmer's perspective.
With bioinformatics being a recently booming sphere and many scientists
finding themselves in need of computer programmers to help them process
their data, I thought it would be good if there was more information for
programmers about the genomic side of things.
</p>
<p>
Rex Dwyer has produced a book, <a href="http://books.cambridge.org/052180177X.htm">Genomic Perl</a>,  which bridges the gap. As well as teaching
basic Perl programming techniques to biologists, it introduces many
useful genetic concepts to those already familiar with programming. Of
course, as a programmer and not a biologist, I'm by no means qualified
to assess the quality of that side of the book, but I certainly learned
a lot from it. 
</p>
<p>
The first chapter, for instance, taught the basics of DNA transcription
and translation, the basics of Perl string handling, and tied the two
concepts together with an example of transcription in Perl. This is
typical of the format of the book - each chapter introduces
a genetic principle and a related problem, a Perl
principle which can be used to solve the problem, and a program
illustrates both. It's a well thought-out
approach which deftly caters for both sides of the audience.
</p>
<p>
However, it should be stressed that the book is a substitute neither for
a good introductory book on Perl nor a good textbook on genetics; and
indeed, I think it will turn out to be better for programmers who need
an over-arching idea of some of the problems involved with
bioinformatics than for biologists who need to turn out working code. 
For instance, when it states that a hash is the most convenient data
structure for looking up amino acids by their codons, it doesn't say
why, or even what a hash is. On the other hand, amino acids and codons
are both explained in detail.
</p>
<p>
The book covers a wide range of biological areas - from the structure of
DNA to building predictive models of species, exploring the available
databases of genetic sequences including readers of the GenBank database
and an implementation of the BLAST algorithm, phylology, protein
databases, DNA sequence assembly and prediction, restriction mapping,
and a lot more besides. In all, it's a good overview of the common
areas in which biologists need computer programs.
</p>
<p>
There's a significant but non-threatening amount of math in there,
particularly in dealing with probabilities of mutation and determining
whether or not events are significant, but I was particularly encouraged
to see discussion of algorithmic running time; as the author is
primarily a computer science professor and secondarily a
bioinformaticists, this should not be too surprising. However, a
significant number of bioinformaticists tend to produce code which
works... eventually. Stopping to say "well, this is order n-to-the-6 and
we can probably do better than that" is most welcome.
</p>
<p>
Onto the code itself. The first thing any reader will notice about the
book is that the code isn't monospaced. Instead, the code is "ground",
pretty-printed, as in days of old. This means you'll see code snippets
like:</p>

<blockquote style="font-family:sans-serif">
<b>next unless</b> $succReadSite; <i>## dummy sinks have no successor</i><br />
<b>my</b> $succContigSite =  $classNames-&gt;find($succReadSite);<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I have to admit I really like this, but others may find it
difficult to read, and those who know  slightly less Perl may find it
confusing - the distinction between '' and &quot; <!-- Hello, copyeditor! -->
(that's two single quotes and a double quote)
can be quite subtle, and if you're going to grind Perl code, regular
expressions really, really ought to be monospaced. &quot;<span style="font-family:sans-serif">$elem =~
/^[(^\[(]*)(\(.*\))?$/;</span>" is just plain awkward.
</p>

<p>
The code is more idiomatic than much bioinformatic code that I've seen,
but still feels a little unPerlish; good use is made of references,
callbacks and object oriented programming, but three-argument
<code>for</code> is used more widely than the fluent Perl programmer
would have it, and things like</p>
<pre><code>
    main();
    sub main {
        ...
    }</code></pre>
<p>worry me somewhat. But it works, it's efficient, and it's certainly
enough to get the point across.
</p>

<p>
The appendices were enlightening and well thought-out: the first turns
an earlier example, RNA structure folding, into a practical problem of
drawing diagrams of folded RNA for publication; the other two tackle
matters of how to make some of the algorithms in the text more
efficient.
</p>

<p>
All in all, I came away from this book not just with more knowledge
about genetics and biology - indeed, some of what I learned has been
directly applicable to some work I have - but also with an understanding
of some of the complexity of the problems geneticists face. It fully
satisfies its goals, expressed in the preface: teaching computer
scientists the biological underpinnings of bioinformatics, providing
real, working code for biologists without boring the programmers, and
providing an elementary handling of the statistical considerations of
the subject matter. While it will end up being more used by programmers
getting into the field, it's still useful for the biologists already
there, particularly when combined with something like James Tisdall's
book or <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl3">Learning
Perl</a>. But for the programmer like me, interested in what biologists
do and how we can help them do it, it's by far the clearest introduction
available, and I would heartily recommend it.</p>

<i>Disclaimer</i>: As you know, each month I try to review a recently published Perl book,
and I aim to cover all the majors as they come out. The book that's
fallen onto my desk for review this month is Dave Rolsky and Ken
Williams' <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlhtmlmason">Embedding Perl in
HTML with Mason</a> "What is this," you're thinking, "an O'Reilly site
doing a review of an O'Reilly book? Scandalous!" Well, I hope that you've
taken a look at my other reviews and have satisfied yourself that I try to 
be as impartial as I can when reviewing. As far as I'm concerned, this
is a Perl site first and an O'Reilly site second.
</p>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/795" template="article_sidebar.view">

<p>
With that disclaimer out of the way, onto the book! There are plenty of
ways of achieving the Perl-in-HTML goal, as this book correctly points
out: the <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template
Toolkit</a>, the venerable <a href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/">embperl</a>, and so on. My
personal favorite, however, is <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/"><code>HTML::Mason</code></a>, and so I've
been looking forward to this book for a long time. That also means,
however, that I've had high expectations of it; Rolsky and Williams'
effort has lived up to many of them but let me down in a few areas.</p>

<p> The first chapter does a good job of setting the scene - it
describes a little of what Mason looks like, talks about some of the
alternatives to Mason, and shows how to install the module and test it. 
While the first description is precisely what is needed, and the test
process is well-documented, I feel more could have been made of the
comparison to other techniques - tools such as PHP and Template Toolkit are
described, but they're not compared to Mason, so it's hard to see
their relative strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, the installation
process for Mason is quite detailed, and brushing it off with
"<code>perl Makefile.PL; make; make install</code>" doesn't do it
justice - an example of the output would make readers feel more
comfortable.</p>

<p>The book then goes on to introduce the main syntax of Mason
components. This is a useful section and I learned a lot about various
ways Mason tags are interpreted, but I felt it would have been
better structured with more examples building on top of one another; that
said, the chapter did declare itself to be an introduction to Mason
syntax and semantics, and as that, it succeeded - however, I think it
would have been a better tutorial if both semantics and syntax were
covered.</p>

<p>The short chapter on autohandlers and dhandlers was a sermon from the
clouds. I've long known that these things existed and were powerful, but
until reading chapter 3, I didn't quite know how they should be used.
The section on the Mason API again unfortunately suffers from a lack of
examples; but on the other hand, the book builds up to a full
example in chapter 8. The "advanced features" chapter was a complete
goldmine of information. Like many of these early chapters, it contains
a lot of concentrated goodness in not many pages, and it will take me
several more readings to pick out and understand more
of the ideas. 
</p>
<p>Chapter 6, another short (10 page) chapter on the "lexer
compiler, resolver and interpreter objects" seems to be included for
completeness or for hard-core Mason hackers - it could be skipped or
moved to an appendix with no loss of flow or coverage.
</p>
<p>
As I've mentioned, chapter 8 is where it all comes together: a full,
real-life application (the <a href="http://apprentice.perl.org/">Perl
Apprenticeship site</a> - an interesting resource in its own right!) is
put together before your very eyes. As this is a real live site, areas
such as creating user accounts and handling access control have to be
covered. If you're doing anything at all with Mason, then I'd urge you to buy
this book if only for this chapter - once you've worked through it,
you'll have a much clearer idea of how a Mason site fits together.
</p>
<p>
Later chapters cover mixing Mason and CGI, another brief (8 page)
chapter on design, and another gold mine chapter of recipes.
Chapters like this and the advanced topics chapter are the reason you
buy books on open source projects: sure, there may be free
documentation's there - and the Mason documentation is pretty thorough - but
it doesn't directly tell you how to do what you want to do. The
documentation doesn't
often cover the situations you find yourself in when you're actually
developing with the tool in question; I'm happy to say that this book
does.</p>
<p>
Appendices
cover the Mason API, (which is odd, given chapter 4 covers that ...) the
Mason-object model, using Mason with your favorite text editor (a
surprisingly useful set of information!) and information about
Bricolage, a Mason-based context management system; useful as yet
another set of ideas for what Mason can do.
</p>
<p>
On an aesthetic note, kudos to O'Reilly for restoring the spine
coloring - now my bookshelf can be color-coded again; now bring back
Garamond!
</p>

<p>
If I've sounded at all negative in this review, then it's probably because
I've been expecting this book for a while and have had high hopes for
it. That said, my overall impression of this book is that it's a little
thin - short chapters and few worked examples leave one wanting more. On
the other hand, the full example in chapter 8 is worth its weight
in gold, and when combined with the advanced concept and cookbook
chapters, I'd give this book a qualified thumbs-up for anyone doing any
Mason work. </p>

            <p>As Andy Lester points out in this month's Perl Review, one big advantage
of there being so many Perl books around is that the publishers can now
get around to putting out books on some of the more &quot;niche&quot; areas of
Perl. Finally, we can explore many areas that haven't really been
written down and codified before.</p>
<p>Sam Tregar's &quot;Writing Perl Modules For CPAN&quot; certainly does this, and in
a good way; most hints and strategies for designing, creating and
maintaining Perl modules, including the sometimes arduous community
interaction that this entails, have been handed down wordlessly through
observation of the old hands. I tried my best in the core <code>perlnewmod</code>
documentation to explain some of the issues involved, but Sam - a bit of
an old hand himself, with the <code>HTML::Template</code> and <code>Devel::Profiler</code>
modules amongst his output
- takes the time to cover all the bases: from how to create a module
distribution and how to get your PAUSE ID and so on to how
to handle feature creep, setting up mailing lists and CVS servers, and
with &quot;bonus&quot; chapters on XS programming and CGI applications.</p>
<p>Don't be put off by the book's title; even if you're not planning on
making your modules public, we've found that the techniques of good
distribution management and source control explained in this book are
assets even when you're developing modules internal to a company or
specific application.</p>
<p>Frequent readers of my reviews will know that one of my favorite
subjects is introductory filler, and this book doesn't get off lightly
either; chapter 1, the history and motivation of the CPAN, really ought
to go in the foreword, and chapter 2, Perl module basics, should be
required knowledge.</p>
<p>The writing style is friendly but direct, although I occasionally feel
that the author tends to overuse footnotes a little, (Chapter 7 has 25
footnotes in 10 pages) and has a good mix of practical and philosophical
discussion appropriate for this topic. The code style is perfectly fine,
although I would like to have seen <code>use strict</code> a little more
prominently, and some discussion of error handling and checking would not
have gone amiss.</p>
<p>On the down side: typography. For some reason, the book's designer is
enamoured of bold and italic typewriter faces for headings, which
frankly looks horrible. Sadly, typos are rife, and there are some
surprising omissions, too: The wonderful cpan-upload script is not
mentioned, nor is the <a href="http://rt.cpan.org">CPAN bug-tracking system</a>,
and coverage of testing, one of the recent obsessions of the Perl module
community, is quite thin.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I was surprised by the XS chapters; they work. Sam
somehow manages to pack just enough information into two relatively slim
chapters at the end of the book to allow some pretty complex XS modules
to be created by the adventurous reader, but then follows it with quite
a bit of repetition in the following chapter, on <code>Inline::C</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the chapter on Great CPAN Modules was an unexpectedly good
read - I'd never before sat down and thought about why one particular
XML parsing module (say) should be more popular than another, and this
is a good summary of the issues involved.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about writing a Perl module, whether or not it's for
public consumption, then I'd certainly recommend getting a copy of this
book; I certainly learned a few things about module maintainance from
it, and I'm sure you will too.</p>
