<p>
I thought it was going to be a quiet week, but then bang, 140 messages
arrived on Friday.  Fortunately for you, most of them are ignorable.
Did I mention that these reports are made possible through the
generosity of O'Reilly and Associates, who pay me a salary?
</p>

<p>
Next week's report will be late, because on Sunday I will be in
London with the Perl Mongers.  Expect the next report sometime in
early December.

<h3><a name="XSLoaderpm" id="XSLoaderpm"><code>XSLoader.pm</code></a></h3>

<p>

Ilya contributed a new module, 
<code>XSLoader</code>, which is a cut-down version of 
<code>Dynaloader</code>.  It uses less memory and has a simpler interface.  He patched the
standard dynamically-loaded modules to use 
<code>XSLoader</code> instead of 
<code>DynaLoader</code>.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00585.html">Read about it.</a></p>

<h3><a name="Threads" id="Threads">Threads</a></h3>

<p> Dan Sugalski submitted a patch that makes a new locking macro available to 
  XS code, but Sarathy said: </p>
<blockquote>Every time I see people patching <code>USE_THREADS</code> code I wonder if it's all going to be for nothing.  I don't see much hopefor salvaging the existing model of <code>USE_THREADS</code> where prolific locking is needed.</blockquote></P>

<p> In case you missed the point of this: 5.005_63 is going to have a drastically 
  different threading model than previous versions of Perl. I asked Dan to explain 
  the two models to me, and he very kindly contributed the following: </p>
<hr />

<h4><a name="Shared_Interpreter_threads_the_current_model" id="Shared_Interpreter_threads_the_current_model">Shared Interpreter threads (the current model)</a></h4>

<p>
This threading model corresponds pretty closely to what most folks
think of when they think of threads. There is a single, shared
executable (or optree, in perl's case), and a single pool of
variables. Any thread can see, and affect, anything that's in its
lexical scope. Data sharing between threads is cheap, but the onus is
on the programmer to maintain consistency.
</p>

<p> As an analogy, consider a thread a hamster, and your program as a giant habitrail. 
  Starting another thread means releasing another hamster into the environment. 
  Threads don't really collide (You ever see two hamsters get stuck in a habitrail 
  tube?) but the only thing that keeps two or more hamsters from running on an 
  exercise wheel at once is careful design of the set. </p>
<h4><a name="Cloned_interpreter_threads_upcoming_in_5005_63" id="Cloned_interpreter_threads_upcoming_in_5005_63">Cloned interpreter threads (upcoming in 5.005_63)</a></h4>
<p>

This threading model corresponds more to the traditional unix fork model.
There is one copy of the optree per thread. One thread can't see or affect
anything in another thread unless that thing is explicitly shared. Data
sharing and coordination between threads is mildly expensive and a bit
cumbersome, but the onus is on the perl interpreter to keep one thread from
messing with another thread's toys.
</p>

<p>
Continuing the hamster analogy, creating a new thread in this model gets
you a whole new, separate habitrail for your new hamster. The two
habitrails may share exercise wheels, but only at very specific, explicit
spots, and there are little exclusion gates built in so only one hamster
can be on a wheel at once.
</p>

<p>

My personal preference is a bit mixed--I want shared threads because they
let me build all sorts of cheap, nifty tools (Threaded objects, and a
subclassable 
<code>Thread::Object</code>, are I&lt;trivial>. I know, I wrote a package to do
it. One thread per object. Wheee!), but I think most folks (including me,
when writing 'normal' code) are better off with the protection cloned
threads get you. 
</p>

<p>
The trickier bit is under the hood. Getting perl thread-safe (which is to
say, it won't core or segfault if the programmer doesn't sync access) is a
PITA. I've already run through a couple of different plans--the first was
paranoid and I, the second bloated 
<code>libperl.so</code> with a lot of shadow
routines for XS, and the third I'm not gonna bother with if threads are
dead anyway.
</p>

<p>
It does chew up more memory, too. To do it right means each and every
variable needs a mutex as well, otherwise you run into deadlock issues and
uneccesary lock contention. 'Course, it makes 
<code>$foo[time]</code> cost even more
than it does now. The alternative is &quote;just don't do that&quote;, but that's not
really an option I like. 
</p>

<p> Most of the p5p folks with an opinion prefers the forkish version. I think 
  they're all wrong, of course, but that's just me. :-) </p>
<hr />

<p>
Thank you very much, Dan.
</p>

<p>
Dan requested that Sarathy commit one way or the other on the existing
threading model.  Sarathy said that he wasn't sure yet, because he needs
to see how the new way works out, but he guesses that Perl will go
with the new way.
</p>

<h3><a name="chomp" id="chomp"><code>chomp()</code></a></h3>

<p>
Ben Tilly askied if perhaps 
<code>chomp()</code> could be made to chomp any of 
<code>"\n"</code>, 
<code>"\r"</code>, or 
<code>"\r\n"</code>.  Of course, this is out of the question.
</p>

<p>
Mike Guy pointed out, and others concurred, that the correct solution
here is for the I/O subsystem to figure out what kind of file it is
reading and translate the line endings to 
<code>\n</code> regardless of what they might have been originally.  This then falls
 under the general heading of `line disciplines'.

<h3><a name="Threading_and_Regexes" id="Threading_and_Regexes">Threading and Regexes</a></h3>

<p>
A few weeks ago Rob Cunningham reported that he and Brian Mancuso at
MIT were working on fixing regexes under threaded Perl.  On Friday,
Brian wrote in with his patch.  Ilya did not like it because it
indirects the match variables through a global variable rather than
through the pads (which is the right approach), and because he thinks
the MIT solution will be slow.  Rob replied that they need it to work
now, and it is more important for it to work than for it to work
speedily.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00853.html">Sarathy's reply to the patch </a></p>

<p>
 is probably the most illuminating.  Rob said that they probably
 don't have time to do it the right way.
</p>

<h3><a name="Safe::Hole" id="Safe::Hole"><code>Safe::Hole</code></a></h3>

<p>
Yasushi Nakajima announced a new module, 
<code>Safe::Hole</code>, which allows you to install a subroutine  into a 
<code>Safe</code> compartment so that it can be called by code in the compartment but
still run in the original compartment; similarly you can install an
object
into a compartment so that method calls on the object proceed outside
the compartment.  Yasushi's example is:
</p>

<p> Suppose you have a CGI program that wants to evaluate some user code in a 
  safe compartment and to give it access to the <code>CGI</code> object. Just 
  installing the <code>CGI</code> object into the compartment is not enough because 
  then the object's methods are inaccessible. Instead, wrap up the <code>CGI</code> 
  object in a <code>Safe::Hole</code> object and install the <code>Safe::Hole</code> 
  object into the compartment. Now you can make method calls on the <code>Safe::Hole</code> 
  object inside the compartment and they will be forwarded to the appropriate 
  subroutines outside. </p>
<h3><a name="PREPARE" id="PREPARE"><code>PREPARE</code></a></h3>

<p>

(
<a href="/pub/1999/10/p5pdigest/THISWEEK-19991017.html#prepare">Earlier summary</a>)
</p>

<p>
Following 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-10/msg00356.html">Sarathy's earlier request</a>, Ilya reworked his earlier
<code>PREPARE</code> patch  so that invocation of 
<code>PREPARE</code> methods is enabled by a compile-time pragma.
</p>

<p>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00882.html">The patch.</a></p>

<h3><a name="Marshalling_Modules" id="Marshalling_Modules">Marshalling Modules</a></h3>

<p>

David Muir Sharnoff has some module which, like 
<code>MLDBM</code>, needs to talk to an unknown marshalling module such as 
<code>Storable</code> or 
<code>Freezethaw</code>.  
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00567.html">Last week</a>, he noted that 
<code>MLDBM</code> contained a lot of code that informed it about how to talk to these
various serializers.    David suggested that authors of marshalling
modules try to adhere to a common intereface.
</p>

<p>
Raphael Manfredi, one of the authors of 
<code>MLDBM</code>, said that this would be unlikely, since the various marshalling
modules have different interfaces for a good reason, namely that they
do not all do the same thing.  For example, 
<code>Storable</code> has an 
<code>nstore</code> method that guarantees network byte order.  But byte order is
totally
 irrelevant to the representation used by 
<code>Data::Dumper</code>.
</p>

<p> David then suggested that someone extract the serializer-interface code from 
  <code>MLDBM</code> so that it could be borrowed by other modules that need serializers. 
  If anyone was looking for a useful project to do, this might be a good opportunity. 
</p>
<h3><a name="Local_Address_in_LWP" id="Local_Address_in_LWP">Local Address in <code>LWP</code></a></h3>

<p> <a href="../10/THISWEEK-19991031">A few weeks ago</a> Gisle Aas suggested 
  having <code>IO::Socket</code> pay attention to the <code>LocalAddr</code> environment 
  variable. This week, <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00577.html">Graham 
  explained why this would be a bad idea</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="localizing_select_and_chdir" id="localizing_select_and_chdir"><code>local()</code>izing <code>select()</code> and <code>chdir()</code></a></h3>

<p> Jeff Pinyan suggested that <code>local()</code> be extended to apply to these, 
  although he did not provide a patch. I pointed out that such semantics are already 
  implemented by modules like <code>SelectSaver</code>, and that the <code>Alias</code> 
  module shows how an XS module can export arbitrary semantics into a block that 
  will be undone automatically when the block is exited. I also pointed out (apparently 
  unintelligibly, since Sarathy repeated it in the next message) that it owuld 
  be easy to write an XS module which specifies that an arbitrary user-supplied 
  anonymous function be invoked at block exit time; then it would be easy to write 
  a <code>temp_chdir()</code> function whose effect was automatically undone at 
  the end of the block. Someone should write this. </p>
<h3><a name="Wandering_Environment" id="Wandering_Environment">Wandering Environment</a></h3>

<p>

Joerg Schumacher found a core-dmuping bug.  Here is the explanation:
He uses the 
<code>Term::Readline::Gnu</code> module.  When this is laoded, it checks for 
<code>LINES</code> and 
<code>COLUMNS</code> environment variables and installs them if they are not present.  It
uses the 
<code>putenv</code> function for this, and in this case 
<code>putenv</code> relocates the entire environment.  Later, he uses the 
<code>%ENV</code> hash to set an environment variable.  Normally, the first time you
set an environment variable, perl relocates the environment elsewhere
so that it can do memory management on it in a more convenient way,
including freeing individual environment variable strings.  How does
Perl know whether it is the first time or not?  It compares the current
location of the environment (
<code>environ</code>) with the location that the environment was
in at the time perl started (
<code>PL_origenviron</code>); if they are the same, it relocates the environment.   
</p>

<p>
However, in Joerg's case, the environment had already been relocated
by 
<code>putenv()</code>.  The `first-time' test failed when it should have succeeded, and
Perl supposed that it had already 
relocated the environment itself.  Then it tried to do memory
management on the environment which it thought it had but allocated
but had not, and the
result was a core dump.  Joerg supplied a patch that has perl keep an
explicit boolean variable that records whether or not it has moved the
environment, instead of depending on the hack of testing to see
whather or not it is in the same place it was when Perl started.
</p>

<p>
Ilya appeared not to understand the problem description, and argued
with Joerg a lot, but if there was anything in his 
argument I was not able to discern it.  Joerg was remarkably patient
through all of this.
</p>

<p>
Then Tom and Ilya had a big worthless argument which should have been
carried on in private email.  
<!-- No duh, it is my opinion.  Whose opinion were you expecting? --></p>

<p> There were fifty-four messages in this thread. I will generously award it 
  a S/N ratio of 1.21e-01. </p>
<h3><a name="Localized_Assignment" id="Localized_Assignment">Localized Assignment</a></h3>


<p>
Andre Pimlott reported that 
</p>

<pre>
 { local ($/ = undef); ... }
</pre>

<p> not only doesn't do what was wanted, but doesn't appear to do anything sensible 
  at all. (For example, someone suggested that it does the assignment to <code>$/</code> 
  first, and then localizes, but this appears not to be so.) It appears to be 
  a real bug. </p>
<h3><a name="goto_out_of_scope_of_local" id="goto_out_of_scope_of_local"><code>goto</code> out of scope of <code>local</code></a></h3>


<p>
Ilya complained that using magical 
<code>goto</code> to exit the scope of a 
<code>local</code> undoes the localization:
</p>

<pre>
 $a = 5;
 sub a { print $a }
 sub b {local $a = 9; goto &a}
 b();
</pre>

<p>
This prints 5, and he wants it to print 9.
(Note that Ilya's original report contains an error; he has 
<code>local $b</code> instead of 
<code>local $a</code>.)  The reason he wants this is so that he can do:
</p>

<pre>
 local @ISA = (@ISA, 'DynaLoader');
 goto \&DynaLoader::bootstrap;
</pre>

<p>
Nick Ing-Simmons suggested that he do this instead:
</p>

<pre>
 {
   local @ISA = (@ISA, 'DynaLoader');
   &DynaLoader::bootstrap;
 }
</pre>

<p>
Of course, that leaves the original call on the call stack so that
(for example) messages from 
<code>Carp</code> might be confused about where to report an error from.  In the case
of 
<code>Carp</code> there actually is no problem.  Discussion ended abruptly.
</p>

<h3><a name="use_foo_if_bar;" id="use_foo_if_bar;"><code>use <var>foo</var> if <var>bar</var></code>;</a></h3>

<p>
Ilya contributed a patch to enable this syntax, and similarly 
<code>unless</code>.  It does this by faking up a 
<code>BEGIN</code> block, but without the scoping effects of a real block.  (The scoping
 effects are the reason why the programmer cannot simply use 
<code>BEGIN</code> here in the first place.)  
</p>

<p>
Steve Fink contributed an amendment to Ilya's patch.  Tom Christiansen
sent a giant message complaining that the feature was yet another
weird special case.  Some discussion of alternatives ensued, with no
conclusion that I could see.
</p>

<p>
Tom Christiansen suggested a 
<code>no scope</code> pragma, which would `erase' one set of braces.  Then you
could say something like
</p>

<pre>
 BEGIN {
   no scope;
   if (SOMETHING) {
     no scope;
     use integer;
   }
 }
</pre>

<p>
And the 
<code>no scope</code> declarations would upscope the effectof the 
<code>use integer</code> pragma so that its effect continued to the end of the file.
</p>

<p>
Larry had
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00866.html">many interesting things to say about this</a>; the most straightforward was that something like
<code>use comppad</code> should just upstack declarations all the way to the top of whatever
code was currently being compiled.
</p>

<p>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00873.html">Ilya said</a> that that behavior was already available to any module that uses the
 hints variables 
<code>$^H</code> or 
<code>%^H</code>.
</p>

<h3><a name="croak_confounds_eval" id="croak_confounds_eval"><code>croak</code> confounds <code>eval</code></a></h3>

<p>
David Blumenthal reported a problem in 
<code>IPC::Open3</code>:  It forks a child, which tries to exec your command, and if it
can't, the child croaks.  If the  
<code>open3</code> call was inside an 
<code>eval</code> block, that means that the child returns from the 
<code>eval</code> block without exiting and your program gets a big surprise.  David
suggests that it should use  
<code>carp</code> instead and then call 
<code>exit</code>.
</p>

<p> I mention this because probably a lot of other modules have similar problems. 
  Modules should never call <code>croak</code> or <code>die</code>. </p>
<h3><a name="Control_backslash" id="Control_backslash">Control-backslash</a></h3>

<p>

Philip Newton pointed out that there was no way to generate a
control-backslash using the 
<code>\c</code> notation.  Neither 
<code>"\c\"</code> nor 
<code>"\c\\"</code> works.  The first complains about an unmatched quotation mark, 
and the second generates a control-backslash followed by a regular
backslash.  (
<code>\x1c</code> and the like do work.)
</p>

<p> The reason for this is explained in detail in <code>perlop</code>, in the 
  section titled `Gory details of parsing quoted constructs'. </p>
<h3><a name="Empty_Conditional_in_while" id="Empty_Conditional_in_while">Empty Conditional in <code>while()</code></a></h3>

<p>
Greg Bacon reported that 
</p>

<pre>
 while () { CODE }
</pre>

<p>
is legal, and is an infinite loop.  This turns out not to be a bug; it
is because you are supposed to get an empty loop if you leave out the
condition in a 
<code>for (;;)</code> block, and 
<code>for(;;)</code> and 
<code>while()</code> are the same thing.  Larry even said he allowed the empty condition
 in 
<code>while()</code> on purpose back in Perl 1.  Ilya asked why not get rid of it, similar
 to the way that 
<code>if BLOCK BLOCK</code> was gotten rid of.  Larry pointed out that the two cases are not
 really analogous:  
<code>if BLOCK BLOCK</code> was removed (or broken) entirely by accident and that the only reason
 this was never fixed was that nobody at all complained about it.

<h3><a name="Undefined_Function_Warning" id="Undefined_Function_Warning">Undefined Function Warning</a></h3>

<p>
Mike Taylor wrote in to ask for a warning that would announce (at
compile time) the presence of calls to undefined functions.  Dan
Sugalski enumerated some of the reasons why there isn't already such a
warning:  
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>ed functions; calls to platform-specific functions guarded by 
<code>if ($^O eq 'Eniac')</code>; functions loaded by 
<code>require</code>; people getting funky with the symbol table.
</p>

<p> Tom Christiansen pointed out that <code>perl -MO=Lint,-context,-undefined-subs 
  program</code> does something like this already. That seemed to satisfy Mike. 
</p>
<h3><a name="Static_Extensions" id="Static_Extensions">Static Extensions</a></h3>

<p> Margie Levine asked about compiling perl with statically-linked extensions. 
  Andy Dougherty replied that all the documentation may have gotten lost, the 
  best way it to just dro pthem in the <code>ext/</code> directory before you 
  run <code>Configure</code>, which is supposed to notice the extensions and built 
  them as if they were part of the standard set. </p>
<h3><a name="POD_Hack" id="POD_Hack">POD Hack</a></h3>

<p>

Ilya points out that a construction like this:
</p>

<pre>
 C&lt;S&lt;
  code with I&lt;..&gt; or L&lt;...&gt; escapes or whatever
 &gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p> Will generate an indented code paragraph that can still contain pod escapes 
  for hyperlinks or whatever. </p>
<h3><a name="Perl_Art" id="Perl_Art">Perl Art</a></h3>


<p>

Greg Bacon reported 
<a href="http://www4.telge.kth.se/~d99_kme/">an entertainment</a>.  (The background is Perl code.)  There was some discussion about
generating pictures of llamas and 
the like in a similar medium.
</p>

<h3><a name="localtime_Contest_Continues" id="localtime_Contest_Continues"><code>localtime()</code> Contest Continues</a></h3>

<p>
Try to guess how many bogus bug reports about the 
<code>localtime()</code> function will be submitted next year.  Visit
<a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/y2k/y2k.cgi">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/y2k/y2k.cgi.</a></p>

<h3><a name="Various" id="Various">Various</a></h3>

<p>
A large collection of bug reports, bug fixes, non-bug reports,
questions, answers, and a small amaount of flamage.  (No spam this
week.)
