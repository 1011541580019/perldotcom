<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This is intended to be a short summary of the major and important
threads of discussion on the perl5-porters mailing list this week.</p>

<p>I am trying to add value to the summary by omitting threads that I
perceive as uninteresting.  For example, you often see threads of this
type:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>Person A</b><dd>Here is a problem with Perl when you try to do X. I propose solution S.
  <dt><b>Person B</b><dd>Solution S is unnecessary because you can do Y instead.
  <dt><b>Person A</b><dd>No, that does not work, because of Z.
  <dt><b>Person B</b><dd>Oh, I totally misunderstood what you were doing.
  <dt><b>Person C</b><dd>But solution S will break existing code.
  <dt><b>Person A</b><dd>No, it won't.
  <dt><b>Person C</b><dd>Oh, you're right.  I thought you meant something else.
  <dt><b>Person A</b><dd>Here is a patch to implement solution S.
</dl>

<p>I am going to try to omit these blind alleys. I will also try to
omit some other types of messages:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>Person D</b><dd>Why are submitting a patch for S when we know it
  will break old code and anyway you could be doing Y instead?
  <dt><b>Person E</b><dd>Fortran has adopted solution S.  Perl is not
  Fortran; therefore solution S is no good.  If you want Fortran, you
  know where to find it.
  <dt><b>Person F</b><dd>You shut up.
  <dt><b>Person G</b><dd>No, you shut up.
  <dt><b>Person H</b><dd>Your formatting style offends me profoundly.
  Can't you get a real mailer?
  <dt><b>Person I</b><dd>How can I develop CGI scripts offline on my
  W98 machine?
  <dt><b>Person J</b><dd>P5P is not a help desk.
  <dt><b>Person K</b><dd>I am writing to report a bug in the <tt>localtime</tt> function.  It returns the wrong month.
  <dt><b>Person L</b><dd>WORK FROM HOME!!!!
</dl>  

<p>A lot of the stuff I omitted is on topic and has real value, but
isn't particularly interesting.  For example I have omitted a bunch of
cases where someone submitted a minor patch that was accepted with no
discsusion.  I omitted some discussions that did not seem to be of
general interest.  For example, Brad Appleton and Ilya Zakharevich had
an exchange about the pod-formatting features of cperl-mode.</p>

<p>It is hard to keep track of everything, and I may occasionally omit
  something you think is important, or I might misunderstand some
  important issue.  Your additions and emendations are welcome.
  Please send any corrections, suggestions, additions, or
  embellishments to <tt>mjd-perl-thisweek-YYYYMM@plover.com</tt> where <tt>YYYYMM</tt>

<p>I wanted to include hot links to the relevant messages in the
archive,  but the archive was down and I could not get the URLs.
This will be corrected in a future issue, even if we have to start our
own archive.</p>
