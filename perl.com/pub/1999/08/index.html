            <!-- 3rd State of the Perl Onion -->
<p>
This talk was delivered by <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry">Larry Wall</a> on August 23, 1999 at the <a href="http://conference.oreilly.com">Perl Conference 3.0</a> in
Monterey, CA.
</p>
<p> <font color="#FF8888"><small> <em>(Note: most of the pictures this year were 
  images of molecules that I animated using a program called <a href="http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/">RasMol</a>, along with a <a href="/1999/08/onion/pmol">Perl 
  script</a> to drive it and make the molecules rotate. You probably don't have 
  RasMol on your computer, and if you do, you probably don't have my script. So 
  in the following I've substituted static images, but these link to the corresponding 
  PDB files, which can be fed to RasMol (or my script, pmol) if you want to play 
  with the images yourself. You can find many more PDB files on the net if you're 
  interested.)</em> </small> </font> </p>

<p> </p>
<hr />

<p> Two years ago, in my <a href="/pub/conference/1997/wall/keynote.html">first</a> 
  State of the Onion speech, I used sounds. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I play ``<a href="/1999/08/onion/au/absorbed.au">You 
  will be absorbed</a>.'']</font></em> </p>
<p> Last year, in my <a href="/pub/1998/08/show/onion.html">second</a> State of 
  the Onion speech, I used pictures. </p>
<p> <a href="graphics/hap.gif"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/hap2.gif" alt="Happy face" width="315" height="240" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Those of you who heard or read that speech will recall that I threatened to 
  use smellovision this year. So guess what. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I hold up an onion.]</font></em> </p>
<p> Here's an onion. Allow me to cut it here in front of you. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I cut the onion.]</font></em> </p>
<p> They laughed, they cried... </p>
<p> And just this last week, they <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/19990816/pl/senate_fumes_1.html">evacuated</a> 
  a federal building in Washington, D.C. because people were getting sick from 
  some mysterious toxic fumes. Guess what sort of toxic fumes they turned out 
  to be? </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I wave the onion.]</font></em> </p>
<p> The active ingredient in onion, the one that makes you cry, is thought to 
  be something called 1-propenyl sulfenic acid. In chemistry shorthand, that looks 
  something like this: </p>
<pre>    <code>CH3-CH=CH-SOH</code>
</pre>
<p> You may be wondering what this has to do with programming. Other than the 
  fact that reading other people's code sometimes makes you want to cry. </p>
<p> The point I would like to make today is that I think the Perl community has 
  ``good chemistry''. We often talk about groups of people having ``good chemistry''. 
  Especially when the group consists of two people who suddenly like each other 
  very much. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, what the phrase ``good chemistry'' usually means is that we 
  don't understand what's making the chemistry good. Chemistry is a mystery to 
  most of us. It's like saying ``It's all Greek to me.'' </p>
<p> There's one little problem with that saying. I can read Greek. I learned some 
  classical Greek at <a href="http://www.spu.edu">Seattle Pacific University</a> 
  as part of my declared major, Natural and Artificial Languages. That was just 
  an excuse to mix up linguistics and computer science. You probably know that 
  already. </p>
<p> What you may not know is that I started off college with a double major in 
  Chemistry and Music. If I can't say, ``It's all Greek to me,'' neither can I 
  say, ``We have good chemistry.'' At least, I can't say it without wondering 
  what it means. I have some ideas about what good chemistry is, and that's what 
  I'm going to talk about today. </p>
<p> So to start, here's one of our favorite molecules. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/caffeine.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/caffeine.gif" alt="Caffeine" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is caffeine. Good chemistry in this case means keeping you awake through 
  my talk. </p>
<p> Actually, you should find this talk interesting if you've ever had anything 
  to do with chemistry. And if you are lifeform that is not based on chemistry, 
  I apologize in advance. Well hey, this'll talk will probably get slashdotted, 
  and who knows how many AI projects are reading slashdot these days? </p>
<p> I'm also tempted to apologize for the fact that this talk is organized organically. 
  But I won't. It's funny, but the way the English language is going, ``organized 
  organically'' is becoming an oxymoron. You wouldn't think so, since the two 
  words are based on the same root. But our world today has two opposing views 
  on the goodness of hierarchy, and each of these words has fallen down on opposite 
  sides of the fence. Modern life is organized, while postmodern life is merely 
  organic. </p>
<p> But I'm not here to talk about postmodernism. I <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html">tried</a> 
  to do that last spring, and afterwards I was thoroughly deconstructed by the 
  deconstructionists for attempting to deconstruct deconstructionism. At least, 
  that's the construction I put on their construction of it. I was talking about 
  postmodern culture, and they thought I was talking about postmodern literature. 
  Not at all the same thing! </p>
<p> Anyway, I'm enough of a postmodern that if you tell me my talk is <em>organized</em>, 
  I'll be insulted, but if you tell me my talk is <em>organic</em>, I'll be complimented. 
</p>
<p> If you tell me my talk is <em>orgasmic</em>, I won't believe you. </p>
<p> At least, not until I light this candle. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I wave around an oversized votive candle.]</font></em> 
</p>
<p> I ordered this candle a couple of days ago over the Web from a company called 
  <a href="http://www.erox.com">Realm Fragrances</a>. They hold the patent on 
  fragrances containing human pheromones. This candle purports to contain human 
  pheromones. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I light the candle.]</font></em> </p>
<p> Come on baby, light my fire... </p>
<p> If you didn't think Perl was sexy before, you will now. </p>
<p> (Whether you want to or not.) </p>
<p> Better programming through chemistry... </p>
<p> Actually, I just read another <a href="http://www.discover.com/sep_99/breakfollies.html">news 
  item</a> a couple of weeks ago that said that some study had just shown that 
  the recently discovered vomeronasal receptors in the human nose are, in fact, 
  vestigial, and don't have neurons to them in adults. Ah, well. Studies are a 
  dime a dozen. If you try hard enough, you can even find studies that prove cigarette 
  smoking is bad for you. </p>
<p> Speaking of studies, a bright fellow by the name of <a href="http://opensource.activestate.com/authors/tedshieh/index.html">Ted 
  Shieh</a> has been <a
href="http://opensource.activestate.com/authors/tedshieh/software.html">studying</a> 
  the demand for programmers of various kinds. He's been analyzing the web site 
  <a href="http://www.dice.com">www.dice.com</a>, where corporate America advertises 
  openings for high-tech jobs, about 132,000 as of today. This is what is known 
  to pollsters as a large statistical sample. </p>
<p> Of course, to a chemist it would be a very small statistical sample. Chemists 
  aren't impressed until you start using exponential notation. You know, Avocado's 
  number, and all that. </p>
<p> Anyway, here's a chart that Ted came up with. It charts the number of job 
  listings on dice.com that mention any of the top programming languages. The 
  chart shows growth over the last six months. </p>
<p> 
  <!--<a href="http://odin.bio.sunysb.edu/~tshieh/software/growth.html">-->
  <img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/gch.gif" alt="job listings on dice.com" width="918" height="621" /> 
</p>
<p> Perl is the yellow line. </p>
<p> Allow me to point out this spot in April when Perl passed up COBOL. </p>
<p> Of course, passing up COBOL is no big deal these days, since demand for COBOL 
  seems to be trailing off, for some strange reason. </p>
<p> Perhaps more to the point, notice this spot in July when Perl passed up Visual 
  Basic. </p>
<p> Finally, notice this spot way down in the corner, where Python finally got 
  off the baseline. A little. </p>
<p> In the race to the millennium, it looks like C++ will win, Java will place, 
  and Perl will show. Some of you no doubt will wish we could erase those top 
  two lines, but I don't think you should be unduly concerned. Note that both 
  C++ and Java are systems programming languages. They're the two sports cars 
  out in front of the race. Meanwhile, Perl is the fastest SUV, coming up in front 
  of all the other SUVs. It's the best in its class. </p>
<p> Of course, we all know Perl is in a class of its own. </p>
<p> Our real competitor according to this chart is JavaScript. They're coming 
  along strong in fourth place. That's not terribly surprising, considering that 
  JavaScript has taken over a lot of the role in the browser that everyone originally 
  thought Java was going to fill by itself. </p>
<p> This chart actually lies a little, since it's not scaled by the number of 
  jobs listed on dice.com. And that number has been doubling once every year or 
  so. So all these lines are a little too optimistic. </p>
<p> Here's another chart from Ted that corrects for that. </p>
<p> 
  <!--<a href="http://odin.bio.sunysb.edu/~tshieh/software/percent.html">-->
  <img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/pct.gif" alt="correction on jobs listed on dice.com" width="931" height="601" /> 
</p>
<p> In this chart, all the languages add up to 100%, so we can see what the relative 
  demand has been over the last six months. </p>
<p> See the pinkish band at the top. Imminent death of COBOL predicted. </p>
<p> Look at these bottom two bands. Of course, we don't want to be fooled by the 
  fact that they're next to each other, but I do think that Java is growing primarily 
  at the expense of C++. And maybe COBOL. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, both Perl and JavaScript are chewing into Visual Basic, and maybe 
  COBOL. Nobody else on the screen is doing any chewing. The thin blue band at 
  the top is Smalltalk. If you look really closely at the black line above that, 
  it gets a little thicker in spots. That's Python. </p>
<p> There's another way in which these charts might be lying. They don't tell 
  us how many jobs there actually are out there. </p>
<p> Perhaps there's no demand for Python programmers simply because Python programmers 
  are really easy to find without using dice.com. </p>
<p> Some of you look dubious. </p>
<p> On the other hand, maybe the demand for Java programmers is driven entirely 
  by hype, and there are in reality no Java programmers out there. </p>
<p> Well hey, maybe that's why they cancelled JavaOS last week. </p>
<p> I really do have a hard time believing that COBOL is dying. Maybe the demand 
  is going down for COBOL programmers because there are billions of COBOL programmers 
  beating down the doors of businesses looking for jobs. Maybe the demand was 
  artificially high because of Y2K fixups. I dunno. Maybe someone did a study 
  that proves COBOL is bad for your health. </p>
<p> Well, enough disclaimers. As long as the demand for Perl keeps going up, we're 
  doing something right. You can call it buzz or you can call it brownian motion, 
  but let's keep doing the good chemistry. </p>
<p> So, all right, what <em>is</em> good chemistry. First of all, good chemistry 
  is a little bit messy. Good chemistry is not the same as perfect chemistry. 
  If you want perfect chemistry, here's an example. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/diamond.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/diamond.gif" alt="Diamond" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> That's a bit of diamond crystal. Diamonds may be a girl's best friend (next 
  to pheromone candles), but they're actually rather boring. Crystals are pretty, 
  but they just kind of sit there, not doing much of anything. </p>
<p> 
  <!--<a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Jewelry/Pearls">-->
  <img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/prl.gif" alt="Pearls" width="325" height="281" /> </p>
<p> Pearls are much more interesting. They're produced by living oysters, after 
  all. They consist of alternating layers of calcium carbonate crystals and an 
  organic binder known as conchiolin. (I suppose it must have something to do 
  with conches.) These alternating layers are what make the pearl irridescent. 
  Calcium carbonate is, of course, a compound of calcium, carbon, and oxygen. 
  Conchiolin is a mixture of various proteins and polysaccharides, rather like 
  your fingernails. </p>
<p> In other words, pearls are complicated, and a little bit messy. </p>
<p> I think good chemistry is complicated, and a little bit messy. I suppose one 
  of the reasons I think that is because, when I was young, I had a chemistry 
  set. </p>
<p> Back in those days, men were men, boys were boys, and chemistry sets were 
  Chemistry Sets. Chemistry sets had real test tubes, and a real alcohol burner, 
  and real chemicals. Dangerous chemicals. The bottles had warnings like, ``Eat 
  thou not of this. If thou eatest of this, thou shalt surely die.'' Or something 
  like that. </p>
<p> Sure, you could do all the fun experiments turning things red or blue or clear 
  again, but you could also do the things that really matter to a junior high 
  boy. You could make things that stink. You could make things that explode. </p>
<p> Of course, they didn't give you everything you needed for that in the chemistry 
  set. You were expected to go down to the drug store and buy your own potassium 
  nitrate, otherwise known as saltpeter. Saltpeter is cool stuff, for a junior 
  high boy. </p>
<p> One day I mixed some saltpeter with sulfur and sugar. You're all familiar 
  with sugar at the macroscopic level. Here's a picture of a sucrose molecule. 
</p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/sucrose.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/sucrose.gif" alt="Sucrose" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Nowadays it seems sort of a shame to use such a pretty, not to mention tasty, 
  molecule merely for fuel, but that's what I did. I discovered a couple of things. 
  First, I discovered that this mixture makes an excellent stink bomb. As you 
  can see here, the sugar molecule has lots of hydrogens. When you burn the mixture, 
  apparently the sugar donates hydrogen and the sulfur donates, well, sulfur, 
  producing hydrogen sulfide in copious quantities. </p>
<p> I also discovered that I should not light off stink bombs in the basement. 
  Besides smelling like rotten eggs, hydrogen sulfide is rather poisonous in large 
  quantities. Guess who had just manufactured large quantities of it. In the basement. 
  Fortunately, no one else was home at the time, and I had the house aired out 
  by the time anyone came home. But I didn't know that, so all morning, the door 
  to the basement had a sign that said, ``If thou goest down here, thou shalt 
  surely die.'' Or something like that. </p>
<p> Maybe someday I'll talk about the rockets. Rocket science is messy too. </p>
<p> By the way, I'm showing you this molecule courtesy of a program called ``RasMol''. 
  No, it's not written in Perl. It's written in C. Sorry. </p>
<p> Believe it or not, there really are a few good programs out there written 
  in C. You know, <em>rn</em>... <em>patch</em>... </p>
<p> Maybe <em>perl</em>... </p>
<p> But in my defense, allow me to point out that I'm running the animation by 
  piping commands to RasMol from a Perl script. And that's as it should be. We 
  don't have to do everything with Perl. We just have to be in control. </p>
<p> Actually, I'm not a control freak. I think I'm more of a chaos freak. </p>
<p> Well, okay, I'm really a controlled chaos freak. Here's some <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Comics_and_Animation/Characters/Wallace_and_Gromit">Wallace 
  and Gromit</a>: </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I play ``<a href="/1999/08/onion/au/WG_control.au">Everything 
  seems to be under control!</a>'']</font></em> </p>
<p> Seriously, Perl doesn't have to be in control. It just likes to be in the 
  middle. Kind of like those carbon atoms there in sucrose. Or here. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/cynac.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/cynac.gif" alt="polycyanoacrylate" width="568" height="264" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is a strand of polycyanoacrylate, more commonly known as superglue. In 
  the middle of things is where a glue language belongs. The world will always 
  have interstices, and we'll always be needing to put glue into them upon occasion. 
  We're in the business of developing better glue molecules. So don't fret yourselves 
  about whether Perl is doing better or worse than some other language in the 
  job market. We're not in that kind of a race. </p>
<p> We do not define Perl as an improved version of some other language. Nor do 
  we have to define Perl as the next universal language. We're not trying to make 
  Perl a better language than C++, or Python, or Java, or JavaScript. We're trying 
  to make Perl a better language than Perl. That's all. </p>
<p> So, what do you want in a glue language? </p>
<p> Well, you have to have the basics, of course. The BASIC programming language 
  was called BASIC for a reason, after all. This superglue molecule shows us a 
  nice bit of linear programming along the backbone. It's a bit obscured by all 
  the cyanide groups. I find it a bit odd that surgeons use superglue because 
  it's non-toxic. Hydrogen cyanide is what they use in the gas chamber in California. 
  Go figure. </p>
<p> Here's a simpler example of linear programming, without all the cyanide on 
  the side. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/decane.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/decane.gif" alt="decane" width="560" height="295" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is decane, a simple linear hydrocarbon. We don't use it for glue. I am 
  undoubtedly burning some decane in my candle here, since parafin is largely 
  made up of long linear alkanes. If we chop this molecule in half, we get a shorter 
  script. Er, program. Er, molecule. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/pentane.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/pentane.gif" alt="pentane" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is a simple molecule of pentane. We don't use it for glue, either. Mostly 
  we burn it up, because pentane is a basic ingredient of gasoline. But certainly 
  not the only ingredient. You'd never want to burn 100% pentane in your car. 
  100% pentane is the very definition of 0 octane gas. To get 100 octane gas, 
  we have to add a branching capability to our language. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/hexamethylethane.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/hexamethylethane.gif" alt="hexamethylethane" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This molecule defines the standard for 100 octane gas. Not suprisingly, it's 
  called octane, or at least one variety thereof. It's official name is 2,2,3,3-tetramethyl 
  butane, which is a really stupid name, because the methyl groups added onto 
  the side of the butane are exactly equivalent to the methyl groups at the ends 
  of the butane. I think it should be called 1,1,1,2,2,2-hexamethyl ethane. But 
  that's not how chemical names officially work. You have to pick the longest 
  carbon chain you can, four in this case, even if thereby you deny the basic 
  symmetry of the molecule. It's kind of like the standard definition of regular 
  expressions, where you always have to match the longest string. Of course, lots 
  of people call it hexamethyl ethane anyway, since real people really do believe 
  there's more than one way to do it. People use minimal regular expressions now 
  too, thanks to Perl. I'm not sure what the octane rating of Perl is. Perl doesn't 
  make your engine knock, but it's not very expensive either. </p>
<p> Here's a cool molecule, if you're into explosions. Or branching structures. 
</p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/nitroglycerin.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/nitroglycerin.gif" alt="nitroglycerin" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> It seems like whenever you run into a cool explosive, you tend to find nitrogen 
  involved, whether you're talking about potassium nitrate, or nitrogen triiodide, 
  or in this case glyceryl trinitrate. More commonly known as nitroglycerin. Also 
  more commonly <em>used</em> as a heart medication than as an explosive. Still, 
  to a junior high boy, it's dynamite. </p>
<p> Of course, not only do we need branching structures in our programming language, 
  but we need various looping constructs. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/tnt.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/tnt.gif" alt="tnt" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> That's TNT, trinitrotoluene, frequently confused with dynamite. But it takes 
  a detonator to get TNT to explode. You can take pure TNT and hit it with a hammer, 
  and nothing will happen. Don't try this with dynamite. It will ruin your day, 
  if not your hammer. </p>
<p> TNT is based on toluene, which is a benzene ring with one methyl group. People 
  used to think of benzene and other aromatic molecules as having double bonds 
  that alternated rapidly with single bonds. But it turns out that all the extra 
  electrons are usually out in a cloud on either side of the ring, which hangs 
  a great big negative charge out there, which is why many potent biological molecules 
  use them. Loops are a powerful part of Perl too. That's why there are so many 
  different kinds of loops in Perl. </p>
<p> And there's more than one way to do it in chemistry as well. Interestingly, 
  you can substitute nitrogens for carbons and get aromatic loops as well. You 
  can always tell the aromatic loops from the non-aromatic loops because the aromatics 
  don't seem to have enough hydrogens attached to the carbons or nitrogens. Perl 
  has other ways of telling loops apart. Here's a molecule that will drive you 
  loopy. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/histamine.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/histamine.gif" alt="histamine" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is histamine. Many of you are intimately familiar with histamines, because 
  as loops, they program you to sneeze repeatedly. Some of you may be producing 
  histamines because of the fragrances in this candle. Some of you may have gone 
  so far as to program your body with an antihistamine such as <a href="http://www.healing-aid.com">Benadryl</a>. 
</p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/benadryl.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/benadryl.gif" alt="benadryl" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Obviously, Benadryl is the more powerful program because it has two loops 
  instead of one. </p>
<p> Alternately, you can view it as the reuse of modules. Though it looks more 
  like cut and paste to me. For real reusability, of course, you need to study 
  catalysts, and their proteinaceous cousins, enzymes. Most enzymes are just chock 
  full of loops, branches, objects, interfaces, and what have you. Many reusable 
  enzymes can be downloaded from the CDAN. That's the Comprehensive DNA Archive 
  Network, replicated in the nucleus of each of your cells. </p>
<p> Just a few more loops. I like loops a lot. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/cyclonite.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/cyclonite.gif" alt="cyclonite" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Here's another dual-use explosive, cyclonite. It doubles as a rat poison. 
  Rat eats it, KABOOM! In this case you can see that the ring is not aromatic, 
  so all the carbons connect to four things and the nitrogens to three things. 
</p>
<p> One thing we haven't figured out how to do in Perl is three-dimensional loops. 
  Hey, Sarathy, let's put this on the Todo list: </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/cubane.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/cubane.gif" alt="cubane" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is cubane. Not aromatic. See all the hydrogens. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/dodecahedrane.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/dodecahedrane.gif" alt="dodecahedrane" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is dodecahedrane. Also not aromatic. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/buckyball.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/buckyball.gif" alt="buckyball" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> And of course, buckminsterfullerene, which is aromatic, for some definition 
  of the term. Note that there are no hydrogens at all. Buckyballs are a recently 
  discovered form of pure carbon, like graphite and diamond. Making organic molecules 
  without hydrogen is kind of like writing Perl without dollar signs. Which oddly 
  enough you will be able to do easily, now that we're getting lvalue subroutines, 
  another recent discovery. </p>
<p> I have a gazillion other molecules I could show you, but I'd like to go back 
  and explain a little more personal history. After all, the theme of all these 
  keynote speeches has been that you can't really understand Perl without understanding 
  Larry. There is an unfortunate corollary, however. Since it's not possible to 
  understand Larry, it's not possible to understand Perl either. </p>
<p> But that's okay, because Perl is a bit like those early chemistry sets. You 
  didn't really have to understand what you were doing in order to do interesting 
  things. You might blow yourself up, but more likely, you'd have a great deal 
  of fun. </p>
<p> I remember a lot more about my chemistry set than I do of high school chemistry. 
  In fact, about the only thing I learned in high school chemistry was Avocado's, 
  er, Avogadros number, 6.02 times 10 to the something big. But between my chemistry 
  set and Avogadro's number, I managed to persuade myself to major in Chemistry 
  in college. </p>
<p> Among other things. </p>
<p> My first year at college, I took inorganic chemistry. Inorganic chemistry 
  is mostly about weighing things. I spent an awful lot of time trying to get 
  the scales to read what they were supposed to read. The error bars on my graphs 
  were always rather too large. </p>
<p> I remember wandering into the lab next door, and being shocked to find a jar 
  of potassium cyanide sitting in the cupboard. I suppose that's when it first 
  occurred to me that we really do expect people not to be idiots. For example, 
  we really do expect people not to call <code>system(&quot;rm -rf *&quot;)</code>. 
</p>
<p> I also learned something about ambiguity that year. I was leafing through 
  a chemistry book when I saw an entry that said, ``periodic acid''. ``Huh,'' 
  I said. I should really have figured it out sooner, since I knew about perchloric 
  acid. Periodic acid is <em>not</em> acid that's periodically acidic, but rather 
  it's per-iodic acid, based on iodine, just as perchloric acid is based on chlorine. 
</p>
<p> Even if periodic acid isn't, the periodic table is. We studied the periodic 
  table of the elements a lot in inorganic chemistry. There's a reason it's called 
  periodic, and it also has to do with the fact that iodine is like chlorine, 
  and fluorine, and bromine. Sort of. </p>
<p> 
  <!--<a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Science/Chemistry/Periodic_Table_of_the_Elements">-->
  <img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/pt2.gif" alt="periodic table" width="801" height="575" /> 
</p>
<p> You know, if this were a computer language, people would say it has too many 
  ways to do the same thing. It has too many features that work too similarly, 
  and at the same time it's missing key features of higher abstraction that would 
  really help an <a href="http://www.mit.edu">MIT</a> grad student. Elements do 
  multiple inheritance of properties, which is evil. Strong typing is not enforced. 
  Nothing should be made of carbon, because organic programming gives you too 
  many ways to get into trouble. There are too many metals, too many gasses, and 
  not enough semiconductors like silicon. There ought to be more elements like 
  carbon. Everything should be made of carbon atoms. Silicon is only good for 
  sand, it should be removed. If this were really object-oriented, electrons and 
  quarks would have the same interface as atoms and molecules. There's not enough 
  encapsulation of electrons in the metals. There's too much encapsulation in 
  the lanthanides and the noble gasses. And why the heck do we need so many different 
  noble gasses anyway? They don't do anything! Throw 'em into that big hole at 
  the top of the chart. And don't get me started on isotopes! </p>
<p> The periodic table is a mess. It should be redesigned. </p>
<p> That's what I learned in inorganic chemistry. My second year I took organic 
  chemistry. That's the same year I started working as a computer programmer. 
  Before that I was working as a projectionist. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I look at the projection screen in the auditorium.]</font></em> 
</p>
<p> You know, I'm still a projectionist. You can never entirely stop being what 
  you once were. That's why it's important to be the right person today, and not 
  put it off till tomorrow. </p>
<p> Organic chemistry is way cool, but there's a problem. You can always tell 
  who is taking organic chemistry on campus. That whole second year, whenever 
  I wandered into the computer center, I was told I smelled like a goat. (In retrospect, 
  I would rather have smelled like a camel.) Anyway, the odor of everything from 
  ether to isoamyl acetate was oozing out of my pores, and it took several weeks 
  for it to wear off after the school year was out. At least, so I'm told. I couldn't 
  smell much of anything for the rest of the summer. </p>
<p> But I enjoyed organic chemistry. We did both synthesis and analysis, but I 
  think I enjoyed the synthesis more. Not too surprising, given who I am. I've 
  never stopped being a synthesist. </p>
<p> Actually, I think chemistry strikes a good balance between synthesis and analysis, 
  between holism and reductionism. As a synthesist, I tend to be scared of reductionism. 
  You know, behavior can be reduced to biology, biology can be reduced to biochemistry, 
  and biochemistry can be reduced to chemistry. Chemistry, in turn, can be reduced 
  to physics. And physics, of course, can be reduced to theology. </p>
<p> Well, hey, that follows logically from the fact that physics can be reduced 
  to math. </p>
<p> Ask most any mathemetician about God, and he'll say something like, ``We can't 
  prove that God exists. However, we can prove that if God does exist, he's pretty 
  good at math. In fact, we can prove that even if God doesn't exist, he's still 
  pretty good at math.'' </p>
<p> Personally, I think God is pretty good at both analysis and synthesis. I like 
  the periodic table the way it is, thank you. </p>
<p> Here's an ester I synthesized, called isoamyl acetate. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/banana.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/banana.gif" alt="banana" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> You know this better as the smell of banana. </p>
<p> <em><font color="#FF8888">[I eat a banana.]</font></em> </p>
<p> You might think bananas are relatively harmless, but after the quarter was 
  over, I took my precious isoamyl acetate to my dorm room. During an all-dorm 
  water fight, I had the bright idea of turning another floor of the dorm into 
  banana heaven, so I got out my stash of banana perfume. One of my floormates 
  grabbed it from me, went down to the other floor and threw it in someone's face, 
  who proceeded to almost asphyxiate. Fortunately, he didn't, so no one ever asked 
  where the banana perfume came from, and I had a close escape from the law of 
  unintended consequences. But one of the consequences was that chemistry lost 
  a bit of its glamour for me that day. Eventually I realized I didn't want to 
  be a chemist. By my third year in college, I had changed my major to Premed, 
  but I didn't really want to be a doctor either. It was just an excuse to take 
  all the science courses I wanted. </p>
<p> But another consequence was that I realized that, whenever you synthesize 
  something, people will find a way misuse it. People misuse Perl too--if you 
  can call spammers people. Perl is the language of choice for network abuse. 
  That doesn't mean Perl isn't a net win for the world. In the long run, I suspect 
  more lives will be saved by nitroglycerin than will be destroyed by it. But 
  <a href="http://www.nobel.se/alfred/index.html">Alfred Nobel</a>'s brother was 
  one of the people destroyed by it. I'd rather not be destroyed by Perl. </p>
<p> Chemistry is a serious subject. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. 
  Here's vitamin C. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/vit-c.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/vit-c.gif" alt="Vitamin C" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Now that's what you call mission critical programming. Here's vitamin B-12. 
</p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/vitamin-b12.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/vitamin-b12.gif" alt="Vitamin B-12" width="512" height="544" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Vitamin B-12 is the proof that cobalt is necessary in your diet. Cobalt is 
  the pinkish atom in the middle attached to five nitrogens and a cyanide group. 
  In this context, cyanide gives life rather than taking it away. Context is everything 
  in chemistry, just as it is in Perl. </p>
<p> Even when chemistry is not life and death to people, it's life and death to 
  bacteria and insects. Here's malathion. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/malathion.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/malathion.gif" alt="malathion" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> One year when my wife was pregnant with one of our kids, we were camped here 
  near <a href="http://www.monterey.com">Monterey</a>, and we got sprayed with 
  malathion. </p>
<p> That kid turned out strange. But then, all my kids turned out strange. </p>
<p> Strange and wonderful. Kind of like Perl. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/nicotine.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/nicotine.gif" alt="nicotine" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> Here's a naturally occuring insecticide. An organic pesticide, if you will. 
  It occurs naturally in the leaves of the species <em>Nicotiana Tabacum</em>. 
  Obviously, since nicotine is a natural insecticide, it can't be bad for you, 
  can it? </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/ddt.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/ddt.gif" alt="ddt" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This molecule with the <a href="http://einstein.drexel.edu/pages/students/kohr/pages/Who_is_Mr.Yuck.html">Mr. 
  Yuk</a> chlorines is DDT, still used in many parts of the world, but not here. 
  We thought it was death for insects, but it was also death for birds. The law 
  of unintended consequences again. But where DDT is still used, millions of people 
  are alive who would have been dead of malaria. </p>
<p> To an organic chemist, pesticides are organic. </p>
<p> To an organic farmer, pesticides are <em>not</em> organic. </p>
<p> That's okay, you can make Perl mean opposite things too. I <em>expect</em> 
  people to make Perl mean opposite things, both good and bad. That doesn't take 
  anything away from the central meaning of Perl. To explain the central meaning 
  of Perl, let's look at the central meaning of the word ``organic''. </p>
<p> If you go back to ancient Greek, the noun <em>organon</em> already meant what 
  we often mean by ``organ'' today; that is, a functional subsystem of your body. 
  But <em>organon</em> could also mean an implement, or a tool, such as a surgical 
  instrument. The related adjective <em>organikos</em> meant ``serving as a tool, 
  or engine.'' There you have it. If Perl is a tool or engine, then you're doing 
  organic programming by definition. </p>
<p> Interestingly, not only could the Greek word mean a surgical instrument, it 
  could also mean a musical instrument. So music is also organic. Perl and music 
  have a lot in common. Maybe next year I should talk about music. After all, 
  I majored in Music too. </p>
<p> If you're really lucky, I'll forget to bring my violin. </p>
<p> Somewhere between music and chemistry there's got to be a joke about organ 
  grinders, but I'll be a monkey's uncle if I can see it. </p>
<p> Anyway, now you know that the ancient Greeks thought their tools were organs, 
  or their organs were tools. </p>
<p> Hmm, maybe I'd better not expand on that. </p>
<p> Actually, as a linguist, I don't believe in etymological meanings. The meanings 
  of words depend on many contexts, but all of the real contexts are in the present 
  language, and true etymology is only in the past. On the other hand, part of 
  the current context is what you <em>think</em> the etymology of a word is. That's 
  why people like me keep trotting out etymological arguments, even though they're 
  relatively meaningless, not to mention wrong half the time. </p>
<p> So, what <em>do</em> I mean when I say I program organically? The central 
  meaning of ``organic'' these days derives from the organs of the body. It means 
  doing business naturally, the way that your body does business, complicated 
  and messy, with lots of interconnections and ramifications and stuff we don't 
  entirely understand yet. But that's the way nature does business. </p>
<p> On the basis of that, the organic farmers can tell you that it's unnatural 
  to use pesticides, because we don't want it to be part of us, while organic 
  chemists can tell you that it's natural to use carbon-based chemistry, because 
  what we're made of. They're both right, in their way. </p>
<p> Likewise, Perl is designed to let you program naturally. Whatever <em>you</em> 
  think natural means. </p>
<p> Perl culture must also be organic. That means that each bond in the molecule 
  of Perl culture must work the way it's supposed to. There is no central atom 
  to the Perl molecule. Maybe I'm a heavy cobalt atom hidden off somewhere in 
  the middle, but the whole molecule is what works. The molecule has what is called 
  <a href="http://www.sciam.com/1998/0198issue/0198ingber.html">tensegrity</a>: 
  the proper balance of pushes and pulls to maintain its integrity. In terms of 
  our culture, it means that sometimes we attract each other, and sometimes we 
  repel each other, but more importantly, it means that we're there for each other 
  there to attract or repel as necessary. Look for balance in your attractions 
  and repulsions. Look for equilibrium. </p>
<p> What's good for the Perl molecule is good for the Open Source molecule. Last 
  year I gave you a picture of the Open Source world taken from physics. </p>
<p> <img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/roche.gif" alt="Rocheworld" width="399" height="187" /> 
</p>
<p> This is <a href="http://www.baen.com/catalog/rlforwar.htm">Rocheworld</a>, 
  where two gravitationally bound bodies approach each other. It's a curious coincidence 
  that the word <em>rapp-roche-ment</em> has a ``roche'' in the middle. The picture 
  was intended to indicate the approach of the open source world to the commercial 
  world. I wondered at the time whether things would become unstable if the two 
  worlds got even closer together. That's what would happen in a real Rocheworld. 
  But gravitation turns out to be an incomplete model for what's really going 
  to happen. Gravity is never repulsive, and can only be balanced by centrifugal 
  force, but the combination of electromagnetism and the strong force make atomic 
  bonds that can push as well as pull. So I think that the open source folks and 
  the commercial folks will find the right balance. Here's a sample molecule. 
</p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/ethyne.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/ethyne.gif" alt="ethyne" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> This is the molecule known to most of you as acetylene. </p>
<p> If we're to make this correspond to last year's picture, then this hydrogen 
  atom on the left is named Richard, and the one on the right is named Bill. (Hmm, 
  they seem to be circling each other. How appropriate.) <font color="#ff8888">[Well, 
  they were circling in my talk, anyway.]</font> This carbon atom on the left 
  is all the open source folks that are trying to cooperate constructively with 
  commercial folks, and this other carbon atom is all the commercial folks trying 
  to cooperate with open source folks. The bond in the middle is simultaneously 
  the strongest bond and the weakest bond. It's the strongest bond, because it's 
  a triple bond. It's also the weakest bond, because it's a very energetic bond, 
  and could be broken by outside forces. </p>
<p> But not by inside forces. </p>
<p> Let me be specific. Some folks in this room are extremely leary of Bill. Others 
  are extremely leary of Richard. These people tend to be leary not only of the 
  opposite hydrogen, but also the opposite carbon. They are supplying the repulsive 
  forces, because they fear the opposite extreme. </p>
<p> At the same time, there are lots of good people who are actively supplying 
  the attractive forces. Nobody has enough power to crush the two carbons together. 
  Nobody has enough power to tear them apart. They're in a metastable state. They 
  have tensegrity. It's my hope that the open source movement achieves this kind 
  of tensegrity. </p>
<p> That being said, acetylene <em>is</em> flammable. If it is abused too much, 
  it can explode. I only ever had one unanticipated explosion when I was doing 
  chemistry in my basement, and that was when I was generating acetylene. I was 
  an idiot, and was generating it in a small glass jar. Don't try this at home. 
  Fortunately, it was a very small glass jar, and I was already wearing glasses 
  at the time. I was shaken but unhurt. I don't play with acetylene much any more, 
  because it is rather touchy stuff. So maybe, if you're thinking about starting 
  a war between the open source folks and the commercial folks, you should think 
  again. First of all, you'll be fighting against a lot of good folks, and you'll 
  probably lose. Second of all, you might win, and the world will be split up 
  into separate atoms. Maybe that's what the hydrogens on the end want, but the 
  carbons in the middle would really like to stick together and make something 
  useful. </p>
<p> If we try hard enough, maybe we can make open source into something stable 
  in the middle. Here's the funniest molecule I saw in my research. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/bcfimethane.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/bcfimethane.gif" alt="bromochlorofluoroiodomethane" width="300" height="300" /></a> 
</p>
<p> It's called bromochlorofluoroiodomethane. I have no idea what it's good for 
  (or more likely, bad for), just as I have no idea where open source culture 
  is going. But I think of open source as the single carbon in the middle, holding 
  steady the separate interests of these four different atoms, bromine, chlorine, 
  fluorine, and iodine, which to my mind represent the domains .gov, .edu, .org, 
  and .com. If we work things right, maybe we can balance things tetrahedrally 
  so that, for instance, the .govs and .edus keep the .coms and .orgs from destroying 
  each other, and vice versa every whichaway. </p>
<p> I guess I really am an optimist. A paranoid optimist, true, but an optimist 
  nonetheless. </p>
<p> Of course, this picture is also an oversimplification. The true picture is 
  much more organic. Whatever that means. </p>
<p> <a href="/1999/08/onion/pdb/vit-e.pdb"><img src="/pub/1999/08/onion/graphics/vit-e.gif" alt="Vitamin&quot; e&quot;E&quot;" width="512" height="283" /></a> 
</p>
<p> I leave you with some vitamin E. Like many of the most useful molecules in 
  biology, it is self contradictory. It has a strongly polar end, and a strongly 
  nonpolar end. It has a funny shape. It smells a little odd. It looks like it 
  was designed by a committee. It's sort of a molecular camel, if you will. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, it's a useful beast. Just as each of those atoms is necessary 
  to the proper functioning of the molecule as a whole, the molecule as a whole 
  is necessary to the functioning of each of you sitting here today. Each of you 
  in turn can be a vitamin that helps keeps the Perl community healthy. </p>
<p> And our collective hope is that the Perl community is one of the vitamins 
  that will keep the world healthy. </p>
<p> The key to equilibrium is to balance out all your reactions. </p>
<p> Don't overreact. Don't underreact. </p>
<p> Don't overact. Don't underact. </p>
<p> But do act. And act passionately, with balance. </p>
<p> I wasn't going to talk about rockets. But I want the Perl community to behave 
  like a rocket engine. What's the point of rocket science? It's to see how big 
  of an explosion you can have without blowing your rocket chamber apart. I want 
  to have the maximum amount of passion in the Perl community without blowing 
  the community apart. So have a little tolerance for other people's passions, 
  even if they don't match your own. Let's balance our passions. </p>
<p> ``Churn, baby, churn,'' as <a href="http://www.garage.com">Guy Kawasaki</a> 
  told us earlier today. It's the only way we'll jump to the next curve. It's 
  how we'll let a thousand flowers bloom. </p>
<p> I feel like I'm still playing with my chemistry set here, and I still don't 
  know what I'm doing entirely. Doubtless there will be more cool stinks and explosions 
  this year, just as we've had our fair share of stinks and explosions in the 
  last year. But face it, we've made many more good smells than bad ones. And 
  the explosions haven't done much besides ruffle a few feathers. </p>
<p> So let's keep doing organic chemistry this year. It's good chemistry, even 
  if we do smell like a camel occasionally. </p>
<p> Thanks for letting me douse you with weird chemicals today. </p>

            <!-- The Perl Conference 3.0 Curve -->
<p>

<br>
</p><P>This year, the Perl Conference 3.0 joined the Linux, Apache, Python, sendmail, and Tcl/Tk conferences as part of the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. 
Since I am a Perl fanatic, my coverage will focus on Perl but there were many 
events in common, such as the keynotes. The conference consisted of two days of 
tutorials, followed by a two-day conference program. 
<P>I am lucky enough to be rooming with Kevin Lenzo. For those who don't know 
who Kevin is, he is THE MAN who organized and put on the "Yet Another Perl 
Conference" (YAPC), back in June in Pittsburg. The YAPC conference was a "grass 
roots" conference that attracted many of the Perl "die hards". It was an 
outstanding success and they have already begun planning next year's conference 
(YAPC 19100). Kevin is here at The Perl Conference as just a "regular guy" 
attending the tutorials and schmoozing with the Perl community. 
<H3>Perl Labs</H3>
<P>I was excited to learn about Perl labs, a web site (<A 
href="http://labs.perl.org/">labs.perl.org</A>) where anyone can go and get 
information on the different Perl ports for different platforms. The information 
available will allow others to find all sorts of portability and performance 
issues that a particular platform may have. 
<P>Perl Labs was the idea of Kurt Starsinic. Current platforms that are 
available for testing and information gathering include FreeBSD, NetBSD, 
OpenBSD, Solaris (both Intel and Sparc), SCO, Unixware, minix, Mac OS10, OSF/1, 
IRIX, HP/UX, AIX and Linux. 
<P>Some of the things that The Perl Labs will provide users with is the ability 
to track changes between the different kernel releases as well as the different 
Perl releases. With this information, it will help others in the Perl community 
to identify areas that may need improvement and allow them to automatically test 
any changes across all of the platforms that are supported. It will also allow 
them to ensure that any changes that they make do not have any adverse side 
effects on the different platforms. 
<P>Your platform was not listed? That is no problem said Kurt, all you need to 
do is download a few programs and dedicate some CPU cycles and your machine(s) 
can be part of the Perl Labs as well. 
<P>Perl Labs will enable the Perl community to test for portability, reliability 
and performance across the widest possible range of systems. No doubt, this will 
prove to be an extremely valuable tool for all who use and maintain Perl. 
<H3>Socializing</H3>
<P>The evenings at The Perl Conference are filled with a lot of fun. Some "geek" 
movies were shown, many beers were downed (some scotch too) but the most 
important part of these get-togethers happens as well, face-to-face business and 
discussions take place. This is an integral part of maintaining the cohesion of 
the Perl community. 
<P>Many of us joke that the Perl community is like a soap-opera. (As The Perl 
Turns). When you get very smart, independent 
people together,&nbsp; there is bound to be people with differing ideas. These get-togethers allow for the "Perl core" to 
conduct the real business of keeping Perl going. This would not be possible if 
it were simply through e-mail and conference calls. The different ideas are what 
make Perl great, after all - "there is more than one way to do it!" 
<P>After all of the excitement of the "normal" day at The Perl Conference, there 
were a couple parties to attend.&nbsp; 
<UL>
  <LI>The Perl Mongers threw a party and fed several hundred of us.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Active State Tool Corporation's party was not nearly as big, but it was a 
  great time. 
  <LI>At the "Open Source Cajun Soiree," the Perl Mongers presented the "White 
  Camel" awards.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<H3>White Camel Awards</H3>
<P>The White Camel award is for those who went above and beyond to promote Perl 
and help the Perl community. Each winner got a very nice trophy and a check for 
$3,000! 
<P>The winners were: 
<UL>
  <LI><I><B>Kevin Lenzo</B></I> won the <I>Perl Community Award</I> for creating 
  and organizing the "Yet Another Perl Conference" 
  <LI><I><B>Adam Turoff</B></I> won the <I>Perl User Group Award</I> for his 
  efforts with the Perl Mongers 
  <LI><I><B>Tom Christiansen</B></I> won the <I>Perl Advocacy Award</I> for his 
  work on the Perl documentation </LI></UL>
<P>A <A href="http://www.inlink.com/~perlguy/tpc3/kevins_mom_award.jpg">nice 
plaque</A> was also presented to Kevin Lenzo for his mother. Kevin's Mom baked 
cookies for 300 people at the Yet Another Perl Conference!</P>
<H3>The Next Curve</H3>
<P>The opening keynote speaker was Guy Kawasaki, CEO and chairman of Garage.Com. 
His talk was titled "Rules for Revolutionaries". He presented us with a "top 10" 
list of things to do for the Open Source community. Guy's presentation was a 
hilarious, yet very practical look on ways to really make a difference in the 
world. Here is his list: 
<OL>
  <LI><B>Set your perspectives right</B>.&nbsp; Jump to the "next curve", don't 
  duke it out on this curve. 
  <LI><B>Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant</B>.&nbsp; Learn all you 
  can.&nbsp; Ask your customers what they want, not a group of 
  "professionals".&nbsp; Get your information first-hand.&nbsp; Pooping is what 
  this conference is about, spread it all around (the source code) 
  <LI><B>Don't worry, be crappy</B>.&nbsp; In the first version of a product, 
  don't worry about being sorry. Take the first MacIntosh computers for 
  example.&nbsp; You can't wait! If it is a great, revloutionary product - ship, 
  then test.&nbsp; If your product is 10 times greater than currently available 
  products, ship it! 
  <LI><B>Churn baby, churn</B>.&nbsp; It is ok to ship crap, just don't STAY 
  crappy.&nbsp; Plan for churning, assume you will have to fix it.&nbsp; Make 
  the product so that it can be improved by others. 
  <LI><B>Enable people to test-drive your products</B>. 
  <LI><B>Make evangelists, not sales right now</B>.&nbsp; Evangelists create a 
  cause out of your product.&nbsp; Turn the facts into emotions. 
  <LI><B>Let 1000 flowers bloom</B>.&nbsp; Let people use your product in any 
  way they choose, even if it is not how you intended for it to be used.&nbsp; 
  <LI><B>Think digital, act analog</B>.&nbsp; In the end, the customer is always 
  analog.&nbsp; Relationships are analog. 
  <LI><B>Never ask people to do things that you yourself would not do</B>. 
  <LI><B>Do not let the bozo's grind you down</B>.&nbsp; The more they grind you 
  down, the more likely you are to be "on to" something. </LI></OL>
<H3>Larry Wall's State of the Onion</H3>
<P>Larry Wall said last year that he was going to use "smells" during his talk 
at this conference. And, of course, Larry held true to his word. He started off
his Third &quot;<a href="/pub/1999/08/onion/talk.html">State of the Onion</a>&quot; speech by cutting a large onion. He also used a 
pheromone candle and a banana during his talk to fill the room with smells. 
<P>Larry used molecular models during his speech to explain Perl as a glue 
language that holds everything together, sort of like a molecular bond.&nbsp; 
Perl will always belong in the middle of things.&nbsp;<P>Larry talked about how the Perl
community can help act as a molecular bond 
between the open source and the commercial sector. There is an 
attraction/repulsion as necessary. He showed a simple molecule to describe this. 
On one side was Richard Stallman, on the other was Bill Gates. Even though they 
might not agree on much, there is a common bond there. There is a state of 
equilibrium that holds the software community together. 
<H3>Not- So Risky Business&nbsp;</H3>
<P>Next, it was off to the "Reducing Business Risk With Perl" talk by Randal 
Schwartz and Tom Phoenix. This talk was designed to help others describe the 
benefits of using Perl in a business environment. Many businesses are very 
apprehensive to use Perl because it is "free". What many of these businesses 
fail to realize is that they are probably already using Perl somewhere on their 
system. 
<P>There are many reasons why Perl is a good choice, some of them are:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li> Source 
code readily available</li>
  <li>no cost</li>
  <li> ported to just about every platform</li>
  <li> Perl has a 
wealth of documentation available</li>
  <li>commercial support *is* available</li>
  <li>Perl is 
great for getting jobs done quickly</li>
  <li>Perl is an excellent "glue" language that 
can be used to bring together many other programs, even if they are not written 
in Perl.</li>
</ul>
<P>The bottom line here though is that Perl is a full-featured, commercially 
supported programming language that can reduce development time while providing 
excellent end-results. 
<H3>The Perl Pro-bowl</H3>
<P>This&nbsp; "Perl Deathmatch" was a contest where the people interested in 
participating had to take a pre-test. The winners were then called from the 
audience in pairs and they had to write a program that the judges had explained. 
While this sounds fairly simple, it wasn't. The programs themselves were not too 
difficult, but the contestants only had 20 minutes to do this in, and then they 
were judged on style and technical merit by a panel of judges.&nbsp; There were 
two "commentators" Chip Salzenberg and Chris Nandor, who were "critiquing" the 
code on the big screen as the contestants were programming. And to top it all 
off, there were about 500 other Perl geeks in the room heckling them as they 
worked. 
<P>I felt really sorry for the contestants - but the winner of the competition 
was Jason Krueger and the VA Linux people gave him a computer for his efforts! I 
think that makes up for all of the pressure he was under! 
<H3>Convincing Others to Adopt Perl</H3>Many of us at this session 
were already convinced of Perl's power, we learned new 
ideas to help promote Perl in places where resistance is being met. Since this 
was more of a brainstorming session, and not a formal presentation, I will 
present some of the key points discussed: 
<UL>
  <LI>Many clients use Perl and don't even know it. 
  <UL>
    <LI>IBM writes a lot of system administration tools in Perl.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>If you can demonstrate the usefulness of Perl, it can often be a big 
  factor in gaining acceptance in a corporation. 
  <UL>
    <LI>A prime example of Perl's power, the human genome project. This is a 
    HUGE project and is utilizing Perl's power and ease of use to accomplish 
    this task.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Perl is a "quiet movement" especially in comparison to the Java language, but it is
    nonetheless doing very 
  well.
  <LI>Visible source-code can be a problem with some companies. 
  <UL>
    <LI>You can never truly hide any language from reverse engineering.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>If there are others out there with Perl success stories, please write them 
  down and send them to the Perl Advocacy people at advocacy@perl.org </LI></UL>
<H3>The Perl Quiz Show</H3>The Perl quiz show was another hit at this years Perl 
Conference. Jon Orwant did an excellent job writing the questions and getting 
things together for the competition. 
<P>The winning team was the London Perl Mongers consisting of Richard Clamp, Peter Haworth, 
Nick Ing-Simmons, and Andy Wardley. 
<P>The questions ranged from easy to absurd. In the end, it was all about having
fun.
<H3>Perl Town Meeting</H3>The conference was once again wrapped up with the Perl 
town meeting. The town meeting gives everyone a chance to ask questions about
Perl, its development, future plans, etc. The panel on hand consisted of Larry 
Wall, Chip Salzenberg, Gurusamy Sarathy, and Tim O'Reilly. 
<P><I><B>Topics discussed were:</B></I><BR>
<UL>
  <LI>How do we "legitimize" Perl, and get it more widely taught in schools? 
  <UL>
    <LI>One suggestion was for those who know Perl, to go to a local community 
    college and offer to teach a course on Perl. 
    <LI>It was also suggested that a list of schools offering Perl should be put 
    together so that people could search on it in their area and find the 
    nearest courses.</LI></UL>
  <LI>Perl "certification" was also mentioned. 
  <UL>
    <LI>The certification issue is really a touchy subject with some in the Perl 
    community. We, as programmers, know that just because someone has a
      certificate does not mean they really know how to program. Yet, many 
    managers look to certification to judge the quality of applicants. The room was still 
    divided on the certification issue when we moved on.</LI></UL>
  <LI>It was asked if the future versions of Perl would optimize subroutines and 
  reduce their overhead. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Chip wrote this down and was going to look into it further.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Embedding Perl in network devices was suggested by someone. 
  <UL>
    <LI>This interested the panel members. By embedding Perl into network 
    devices, you could both legitimize Perl in corporations and make the devices 
    easier to manage with Perl. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>This was about all that the Town Meeting got to talk about before the time 
was up. There are so many issues that can be addressed with any project as large 
as Perl that it makes it difficult to hear them all. 
<P>The best way for people to get their issues heard/resolved, is to become 
active in the Perl community and either work directly on Perl development, or 
bring the issues up with those directly involved. 
<H3>Wrapping it up</H3>If you missed the conference this year, and are use Perl, 
seriously consider coming to the next Perl Conference in July. If the regular 
conference is too expensive, think about attending the next YAPC! 
<P>Don't forget, the Perl community is made up of programmers just like you! 
Become active in your local <A href="http://www.pm.org">Perl Mongers</A> groups. 
If you don't have a local group, start one! The Perl Mongers will help you get 
it all organized. 
<P>If you need to unwind from all of the partying that went on at The Perl 
Conference (or just feel like hanging out), consider coming to <I><A 
href="http://www.inlink.com/~perlguy/campcamel">Camp Camel</A></I>. No, there 
won't be any computers or phonelines there, just Perl programmers getting 
together for a weekend of "goofing off". 
<P>See you at the <I>next</I> Perl Conference! </P></BODY></HTML>
