<p>

<br>
</p><P>This year, the Perl Conference 3.0 joined the Linux, Apache, Python, sendmail, and Tcl/Tk conferences as part of the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. 
Since I am a Perl fanatic, my coverage will focus on Perl but there were many 
events in common, such as the keynotes. The conference consisted of two days of 
tutorials, followed by a two-day conference program. 
<P>I am lucky enough to be rooming with Kevin Lenzo. For those who don't know 
who Kevin is, he is THE MAN who organized and put on the "Yet Another Perl 
Conference" (YAPC), back in June in Pittsburg. The YAPC conference was a "grass 
roots" conference that attracted many of the Perl "die hards". It was an 
outstanding success and they have already begun planning next year's conference 
(YAPC 19100). Kevin is here at The Perl Conference as just a "regular guy" 
attending the tutorials and schmoozing with the Perl community. 
<H3>Perl Labs</H3>
<P>I was excited to learn about Perl labs, a web site (<A 
href="http://labs.perl.org/">labs.perl.org</A>) where anyone can go and get 
information on the different Perl ports for different platforms. The information 
available will allow others to find all sorts of portability and performance 
issues that a particular platform may have. 
<P>Perl Labs was the idea of Kurt Starsinic. Current platforms that are 
available for testing and information gathering include FreeBSD, NetBSD, 
OpenBSD, Solaris (both Intel and Sparc), SCO, Unixware, minix, Mac OS10, OSF/1, 
IRIX, HP/UX, AIX and Linux. 
<P>Some of the things that The Perl Labs will provide users with is the ability 
to track changes between the different kernel releases as well as the different 
Perl releases. With this information, it will help others in the Perl community 
to identify areas that may need improvement and allow them to automatically test 
any changes across all of the platforms that are supported. It will also allow 
them to ensure that any changes that they make do not have any adverse side 
effects on the different platforms. 
<P>Your platform was not listed? That is no problem said Kurt, all you need to 
do is download a few programs and dedicate some CPU cycles and your machine(s) 
can be part of the Perl Labs as well. 
<P>Perl Labs will enable the Perl community to test for portability, reliability 
and performance across the widest possible range of systems. No doubt, this will 
prove to be an extremely valuable tool for all who use and maintain Perl. 
<H3>Socializing</H3>
<P>The evenings at The Perl Conference are filled with a lot of fun. Some "geek" 
movies were shown, many beers were downed (some scotch too) but the most 
important part of these get-togethers happens as well, face-to-face business and 
discussions take place. This is an integral part of maintaining the cohesion of 
the Perl community. 
<P>Many of us joke that the Perl community is like a soap-opera. (As The Perl 
Turns). When you get very smart, independent 
people together,&nbsp; there is bound to be people with differing ideas. These get-togethers allow for the "Perl core" to 
conduct the real business of keeping Perl going. This would not be possible if 
it were simply through e-mail and conference calls. The different ideas are what 
make Perl great, after all - "there is more than one way to do it!" 
<P>After all of the excitement of the "normal" day at The Perl Conference, there 
were a couple parties to attend.&nbsp; 
<UL>
  <LI>The Perl Mongers threw a party and fed several hundred of us.&nbsp; 
  <LI>Active State Tool Corporation's party was not nearly as big, but it was a 
  great time. 
  <LI>At the "Open Source Cajun Soiree," the Perl Mongers presented the "White 
  Camel" awards.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<H3>White Camel Awards</H3>
<P>The White Camel award is for those who went above and beyond to promote Perl 
and help the Perl community. Each winner got a very nice trophy and a check for 
$3,000! 
<P>The winners were: 
<UL>
  <LI><I><B>Kevin Lenzo</B></I> won the <I>Perl Community Award</I> for creating 
  and organizing the "Yet Another Perl Conference" 
  <LI><I><B>Adam Turoff</B></I> won the <I>Perl User Group Award</I> for his 
  efforts with the Perl Mongers 
  <LI><I><B>Tom Christiansen</B></I> won the <I>Perl Advocacy Award</I> for his 
  work on the Perl documentation </LI></UL>
<P>A <A href="http://www.inlink.com/~perlguy/tpc3/kevins_mom_award.jpg">nice 
plaque</A> was also presented to Kevin Lenzo for his mother. Kevin's Mom baked 
cookies for 300 people at the Yet Another Perl Conference!</P>
<H3>The Next Curve</H3>
<P>The opening keynote speaker was Guy Kawasaki, CEO and chairman of Garage.Com. 
His talk was titled "Rules for Revolutionaries". He presented us with a "top 10" 
list of things to do for the Open Source community. Guy's presentation was a 
hilarious, yet very practical look on ways to really make a difference in the 
world. Here is his list: 
<OL>
  <LI><B>Set your perspectives right</B>.&nbsp; Jump to the "next curve", don't 
  duke it out on this curve. 
  <LI><B>Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant</B>.&nbsp; Learn all you 
  can.&nbsp; Ask your customers what they want, not a group of 
  "professionals".&nbsp; Get your information first-hand.&nbsp; Pooping is what 
  this conference is about, spread it all around (the source code) 
  <LI><B>Don't worry, be crappy</B>.&nbsp; In the first version of a product, 
  don't worry about being sorry. Take the first MacIntosh computers for 
  example.&nbsp; You can't wait! If it is a great, revloutionary product - ship, 
  then test.&nbsp; If your product is 10 times greater than currently available 
  products, ship it! 
  <LI><B>Churn baby, churn</B>.&nbsp; It is ok to ship crap, just don't STAY 
  crappy.&nbsp; Plan for churning, assume you will have to fix it.&nbsp; Make 
  the product so that it can be improved by others. 
  <LI><B>Enable people to test-drive your products</B>. 
  <LI><B>Make evangelists, not sales right now</B>.&nbsp; Evangelists create a 
  cause out of your product.&nbsp; Turn the facts into emotions. 
  <LI><B>Let 1000 flowers bloom</B>.&nbsp; Let people use your product in any 
  way they choose, even if it is not how you intended for it to be used.&nbsp; 
  <LI><B>Think digital, act analog</B>.&nbsp; In the end, the customer is always 
  analog.&nbsp; Relationships are analog. 
  <LI><B>Never ask people to do things that you yourself would not do</B>. 
  <LI><B>Do not let the bozo's grind you down</B>.&nbsp; The more they grind you 
  down, the more likely you are to be "on to" something. </LI></OL>
<H3>Larry Wall's State of the Onion</H3>
<P>Larry Wall said last year that he was going to use "smells" during his talk 
at this conference. And, of course, Larry held true to his word. He started off
his Third &quot;<a href="/pub/1999/08/onion/talk.html">State of the Onion</a>&quot; speech by cutting a large onion. He also used a 
pheromone candle and a banana during his talk to fill the room with smells. 
<P>Larry used molecular models during his speech to explain Perl as a glue 
language that holds everything together, sort of like a molecular bond.&nbsp; 
Perl will always belong in the middle of things.&nbsp;<P>Larry talked about how the Perl
community can help act as a molecular bond 
between the open source and the commercial sector. There is an 
attraction/repulsion as necessary. He showed a simple molecule to describe this. 
On one side was Richard Stallman, on the other was Bill Gates. Even though they 
might not agree on much, there is a common bond there. There is a state of 
equilibrium that holds the software community together. 
<H3>Not- So Risky Business&nbsp;</H3>
<P>Next, it was off to the "Reducing Business Risk With Perl" talk by Randal 
Schwartz and Tom Phoenix. This talk was designed to help others describe the 
benefits of using Perl in a business environment. Many businesses are very 
apprehensive to use Perl because it is "free". What many of these businesses 
fail to realize is that they are probably already using Perl somewhere on their 
system. 
<P>There are many reasons why Perl is a good choice, some of them are:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li> Source 
code readily available</li>
  <li>no cost</li>
  <li> ported to just about every platform</li>
  <li> Perl has a 
wealth of documentation available</li>
  <li>commercial support *is* available</li>
  <li>Perl is 
great for getting jobs done quickly</li>
  <li>Perl is an excellent "glue" language that 
can be used to bring together many other programs, even if they are not written 
in Perl.</li>
</ul>
<P>The bottom line here though is that Perl is a full-featured, commercially 
supported programming language that can reduce development time while providing 
excellent end-results. 
<H3>The Perl Pro-bowl</H3>
<P>This&nbsp; "Perl Deathmatch" was a contest where the people interested in 
participating had to take a pre-test. The winners were then called from the 
audience in pairs and they had to write a program that the judges had explained. 
While this sounds fairly simple, it wasn't. The programs themselves were not too 
difficult, but the contestants only had 20 minutes to do this in, and then they 
were judged on style and technical merit by a panel of judges.&nbsp; There were 
two "commentators" Chip Salzenberg and Chris Nandor, who were "critiquing" the 
code on the big screen as the contestants were programming. And to top it all 
off, there were about 500 other Perl geeks in the room heckling them as they 
worked. 
<P>I felt really sorry for the contestants - but the winner of the competition 
was Jason Krueger and the VA Linux people gave him a computer for his efforts! I 
think that makes up for all of the pressure he was under! 
<H3>Convincing Others to Adopt Perl</H3>Many of us at this session 
were already convinced of Perl's power, we learned new 
ideas to help promote Perl in places where resistance is being met. Since this 
was more of a brainstorming session, and not a formal presentation, I will 
present some of the key points discussed: 
<UL>
  <LI>Many clients use Perl and don't even know it. 
  <UL>
    <LI>IBM writes a lot of system administration tools in Perl.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>If you can demonstrate the usefulness of Perl, it can often be a big 
  factor in gaining acceptance in a corporation. 
  <UL>
    <LI>A prime example of Perl's power, the human genome project. This is a 
    HUGE project and is utilizing Perl's power and ease of use to accomplish 
    this task.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Perl is a "quiet movement" especially in comparison to the Java language, but it is
    nonetheless doing very 
  well.
  <LI>Visible source-code can be a problem with some companies. 
  <UL>
    <LI>You can never truly hide any language from reverse engineering.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>If there are others out there with Perl success stories, please write them 
  down and send them to the Perl Advocacy people at advocacy@perl.org </LI></UL>
<H3>The Perl Quiz Show</H3>The Perl quiz show was another hit at this years Perl 
Conference. Jon Orwant did an excellent job writing the questions and getting 
things together for the competition. 
<P>The winning team was the London Perl Mongers consisting of Richard Clamp, Peter Haworth, 
Nick Ing-Simmons, and Andy Wardley. 
<P>The questions ranged from easy to absurd. In the end, it was all about having
fun.
<H3>Perl Town Meeting</H3>The conference was once again wrapped up with the Perl 
town meeting. The town meeting gives everyone a chance to ask questions about
Perl, its development, future plans, etc. The panel on hand consisted of Larry 
Wall, Chip Salzenberg, Gurusamy Sarathy, and Tim O'Reilly. 
<P><I><B>Topics discussed were:</B></I><BR>
<UL>
  <LI>How do we "legitimize" Perl, and get it more widely taught in schools? 
  <UL>
    <LI>One suggestion was for those who know Perl, to go to a local community 
    college and offer to teach a course on Perl. 
    <LI>It was also suggested that a list of schools offering Perl should be put 
    together so that people could search on it in their area and find the 
    nearest courses.</LI></UL>
  <LI>Perl "certification" was also mentioned. 
  <UL>
    <LI>The certification issue is really a touchy subject with some in the Perl 
    community. We, as programmers, know that just because someone has a
      certificate does not mean they really know how to program. Yet, many 
    managers look to certification to judge the quality of applicants. The room was still 
    divided on the certification issue when we moved on.</LI></UL>
  <LI>It was asked if the future versions of Perl would optimize subroutines and 
  reduce their overhead. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Chip wrote this down and was going to look into it further.</LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Embedding Perl in network devices was suggested by someone. 
  <UL>
    <LI>This interested the panel members. By embedding Perl into network 
    devices, you could both legitimize Perl in corporations and make the devices 
    easier to manage with Perl. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>This was about all that the Town Meeting got to talk about before the time 
was up. There are so many issues that can be addressed with any project as large 
as Perl that it makes it difficult to hear them all. 
<P>The best way for people to get their issues heard/resolved, is to become 
active in the Perl community and either work directly on Perl development, or 
bring the issues up with those directly involved. 
<H3>Wrapping it up</H3>If you missed the conference this year, and are use Perl, 
seriously consider coming to the next Perl Conference in July. If the regular 
conference is too expensive, think about attending the next YAPC! 
<P>Don't forget, the Perl community is made up of programmers just like you! 
Become active in your local <A href="http://www.pm.org">Perl Mongers</A> groups. 
If you don't have a local group, start one! The Perl Mongers will help you get 
it all organized. 
<P>If you need to unwind from all of the partying that went on at The Perl 
Conference (or just feel like hanging out), consider coming to <I><A 
href="http://www.inlink.com/~perlguy/campcamel">Camp Camel</A></I>. No, there 
won't be any computers or phonelines there, just Perl programmers getting 
together for a weekend of "goofing off". 
<P>See you at the <I>next</I> Perl Conference! </P></BODY></HTML>
