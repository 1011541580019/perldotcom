Last year I fell behind on reports because I took three business trips
in two weeks.  I still haven't caught up, so I am going to skip the
last couple of reports.  I was going to skip this week's report also,
but it was so small I decided to do it anyway.
The next report should be for 9--15 January.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Last week a discussion started about how to put version information
into modules in a standard way, and Sam Tregar suggested that there be
a convention that the version information and other module interface
information be stored in the POD documents.  Discussion on this
continued.  I should probably have mentioned it in the pervious
report.

</P>

<P>
When you create a GV (glob value) in Perl, it has its SV slot filled
automatically.  For example, when you define 
<CODE>@foo</CODE> or 
<CODE>sub bar</CODE> you get space allocated for 
<CODE>$foo</CODE> and
<CODE>$bar</CODE> automatically.  The rationale behind this is presumably that scalar
 variables are very common and you might as well preallocate them.
(I suppose this is why 
<CODE>defined *{foo}{SCALAR}</CODE> always yields true.)
</P>

<P>
Nick Ing-Simmons complained about this, saying that many SVs are
allocated that are never used, and that the original assumption, that
SVs are very common, may not be true now that most scalar variables
are lexical. 
</P>

<P>
I did not see a resolution of this.

In an

go into 5.005_64 either unless it was fixed to not use a new opcode.
</P>

<P>
I mention this because Ilya replied that Perl needs twenty or thirty
new opcodes, and that last year he demonstrated that by introducing
new opcodes that atomically combine two or more other opcodes that
often appear in sequence, some operations might be sped up by a factor
of two.  This was interesting, although it is not clear that it has
anything to
do with 
<CODE>PREPARE</CODE>.

I wonder why this is so hard to get right?  Is it just that nobody has
taken it up?
</P>

<P>
Ilya said that the last time this had come up, he suggested that Perl
should always flush the buffer between any buffered and unbiffered

<!-- Virtual Presentations with Perl -->


<br />
<P>This summer, at yapc in Pittsburgh and again at the third Perl
Conference, I was very fortunate to meet with a lot of friends from
other regional Perl Monger groups.  A lot of our groups have similar
problems and frustrations.  While larger groups like <tt>phl.pm</tt>,
<tt>ny.pm</tt>, <tt>boston.pm</tt> and others do have many active
members who meet frequently, other groups have fewer than 5 or 10
members and don't get together for a variety of reasons - geography,
time constraints, projects at work, and so on.

<P> Talking about this problem with Sarah Burcham of
<tt>St.Louis.pm</tt>, we hit upon the idea of starting "virtual
presentations".  If an active group like <tt>phl.pm</tt> can have
regular technical meetings, why can't we host them live on the web, so
a small, far-flung group in Missouri or Nebraska can join in?

<P>
So Sarah and I started to talk about this idea some more, and we
started to understand how these "virtual presentations" needed to
work.  Cumbersome Java and proprietary clients were right out - we
wanted to be promoting Perl, after all, and we needed this to be easy
to use, easy to setup and easy to promote.  We needed some way to
synchronize the speaker's slides to his presentation, and we needed
some way for the remote group to ask questions and give feedback.  So
we immediately reduced the problem to the bare essentials.   This got
rid of all of the needless complexity that is the source of both great
demos and countless headaches.

<P> Since <tt>phl.pm</tt> had a technical meeting scheduled a month
after the Perl Conference, we started talking about how we could
broadcast that presentation to the mongers in St. Louis.

<P>
We thought about RealAudio/RealVideo broadcasting to bring a
presentation to a remote location.  Neither RealAudio nor RealVideo
require a large investment in hardware or software to capture and
broadcast a presentation in real time.   This approach, while perfectly
valid, didn't work for us, since the Philly side of the presentation
was taking place behind a firewall.  Assuming that we had the resources
to transmit in real time, we couldn't get the packets out of the
building.  There was also the problem of bandwidth utilization - ISI,
The Institute for Scientific Information, was kind enough to host the
meeting, and we didn't want to overload the network by providing dozens
of RealVideo feeds.

<P>
So, rather than trying to solve this problem with too many layers of
technology, we just routed around it and used speaker phones.  After
all, if we are targeting small, far-flung groups, it should be easier
to find a location with a speaker phone and a slow net connection than
it is to find a location with sufficient unused bandwidth on a T1 line
for realtime audio/video.  A good host site can also use three-way calling
to bring in two remote sites instead of one.  While this technique may
be much more limiting than using RealAudio or other internet audio
broadcast, it is also much more accessible.



<P>
Now that we had the two-way communication problem solved, all that was
left was synchronizing the audio presentation to the slides.  Luckily,
Kevin Lenzo had already solved this exact problem already with his two
'SlideShow' scripts (<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/SlideShow/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/SlideShow/</a>).
<!-- Link added -->


<!-- Following 3 paras rewritten from the previous version -->

<P>
Kevin's scripts are actually quite crafty.  'SlideShow' is actually a
pair of scripts: one used in the presenter's browser, and one used in
each participant's browser.  The idea is very simple -- whatever the
presenter sees in his browser, the participants see in their browsers.
When the presenter follows a link to a new web page, the presenter and all
particiapnts should see the new page.  (This includes pages that are part
of the slide show as well as any other web page, such as www.perl.com.)


<P>
The first of these two scripts, <tt>master.cgi</tt> is used by the person
giving the presentation.  This is the script which fetches web pages and
keeps everyone synchronized.  After fetching a URL, <tt>master.cgi</tt>
rewrites all HREF attributes in the page it fetches so that all links
appear as HTTP GET requests to <tt>master.cgi</tt>.  The rewritten links
contain the original target URL as a parameter.  The new version of the
page is returned to the presenter's browser, so that once he starts using
<tt>master.cgi</tt>, all links followed are part of the presentation.


<P>
The <tt>master.cgi</tt> script also saves a version of each page to
a shared file for the second script, <tt>nph-view.cgi</tt> to use.
The <tt>nph-view.cgi</tt> is a server-push script which can send a
multiple distinct web pages back in a single, long-lived response.
Every time <tt>master.cgi</tt> updates the shared file, each
<tt>nph-view.cgi</tt> instance sends another part in it's multipart
response to one participant's browser.  There is no limit to the number
of users of <tt>nph-view.cgi</tt>, so long as the web server has enough
resources to process one instance of this script for every participant.
To avoid complications, <tt>master.cgi</tt> removes all hyperlinks
before saving a page to the shared file, so that participants don't
inadvertantly stop <tt>nph-view.cgi</tt> from doing it's job.

<!-- Rewrite ends-->



<P>
At this point, we have all the tools we need for a virtual presentation.
We have a host site, with conference phone (or RealAudio/RealVideo server)
a web server configured with the SlideShow scripts, and a network
connection for the presenter to display his slides.  All the remote users
need is a speaker phone (or a high bandwidth connection for realtime
audio) and a simple network connection.  We can continue down this path
and decorate this setup with an IRC channel, a perl/tk whiteboard and so
forth.  Here, we've used Perl where appropriate to make the simple things
simple, and other techniques to make the hard things possible.



<P>
Since August, when Kevin, Sarah and I started discussing this idea,
phl.pm has hosted two of these virtual presentations.  In September, we
hosted Mark-Jason Dominus' presentation on <a
href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/yak/#typing"><cite>Strong Typing
and Perl</cite></a>, with St. Louis.pm.  In October, we hosted
Abigail's presentation on <cite>Damian Conway's
<tt>Parse::RecDescent</tt></cite> with both St. Louis.pm and
Boston.pm.  


<!-- Two paragraphs of details added -->

<P>
Both of these talks worked reasonably well.  Many of the problems we
encountered were not technical in nature.  For example, when presenting dry
material in front of a live audience, a good presenter can see the audience
start to lose interest.  When making the same presentation over a
long-distance connection, it is difficult to discern whether the silence on
the other end of the line means that the remote audience is rivited to
their seats or asleep.

<P>
When presenting to both live and remote audiences simultaneously, it is
more important for a speaker to project his voice in a manner so that
everyone can hear him clearly.  This is different from presenting
unamplified to a small group, or using a microphone in front of a live
audience.


<P>
Here are some other lessons we learned from our presentations:

<OL>
  <LI><p> Test the audio connection early and often.</p>

       <p> This means getting the remote phone numbers as soon as possible.
        If using a conference phone, make sure that there are no long
        distance blocking issues to overcome.  Test three way calling,
        if necessary.</p>

  <LI> <p>Test the SlideShow CGI scripts on your webserver.</p>

       <p> Make sure that you have the CGI scripts configured so that any
        change made in the 'master' window comes up in the 'remote'
        window.  This testing can be done with two browser windows on
        one computer.</p>

  <LI> <p>Have a backup webserver configured and ready to use.</p>

       <p> Nothing is worse than starting a presentation and finding 'no
        route to host' to your shared server.  Having a backup server on
        another host (on another network, if possible) can overcome some of
        these problems.</p>

  <LI> <p>Make many small HTML pages.  Avoid scrolling.</p>

       <p> While a speaker standing in the front of a room can scroll
        down the page to show an example, remote sites do not have the
        same cues and cannot see the presenter scroll down the page.
        Try and rework the content so that you can click to the next
        point or example instead of scrolling down to it.</p>

  <LI> <p>Be clear on what you are highlighting.</p>

       <p> When making a point in view of your audience, moving the mouse around
        to highlight or underscore a point works nicely.  Since remote viewers
        cannot see what you are doing with your mouse, be clear on what points
        you are highlighting.  If possible, rework your slides to make the
        important points more obvious.</p>
</OL>


<!-- Conclusion added -->

<P>
A lot of Perl Mongers are interested in sharing what they know, and
many groups are active enough to hold regular technical meetings.  If you
are interested in spreading your knowledge around, consider inviting a
remote group of mongers to your technical meeting.  It's not too difficult,
and it's actually easier if you use Perl!


<P>
Happy Mongering!

<P>

There was the usual collection of bug reports that follows a new

St&eacute;phane Payrard  complained that even though 
<CODE>%^H</CODE> is mentioned in 
<CODE>perldiag</CODE>, it is not described in 
<CODE>perlvar</CODE>.  Ilya protested that you cannot get that diagnostic unless you
 actually use 
<CODE>%^H</CODE>, in which case he assumes that you understand the diagnostic.
</P>

<P>
Nevertheless, he provided 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00371.html">doc patches </a> that discuss 
<CODE>$^H</CODE> and

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00336.html">Johann Vromans supplied an RPM for Perl 5.005_63.  </a></P>

<P>
Elaine Ashton suggested sending it to Red Hat, and this sparked a
discussion about whether it was a good idea to widely advertise the
existence of an RPM for an experimental development release of
Perl---the fear was that beginners would come along and grab the RPM
and install a development version of Perl on their systems, and then
be puzzled and upset when it didn't work.
</P>

<P>
Sarathy said that he would distribute the RPM with future development
releases, so that the people who test the Perl development releases
could test the RPM also.
</P>

<P>
In the course of this, someone named Pixel said that he or she make a
`hackperl package for Linux-Mandrake'.  I don't know what this is, but
People using Mandrake might be interested to 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00415.html">read the message.</a></P>

<P>
Another interesting sideline: Randy J. Ray mentioned that he had tried
to make the RPM C library into a Perl module, but had not been
successful, because 
<CODE>h2xs</CODE> cannot parse 
<CODE>rpm.h</CODE>.  Perhaps someone else would like to take a look at this.
</P>

<P>
Bennett Todd worked on an automatic RPM packager for Perl modules.  
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00424.html">Details are here.</a>  Andy Dougherty advised caution:
<blockquote><b>Andy:</b> It would indeed be far nicer to have helpful feedback and discussions from various "vendors" <i>before</i> everything is set in stone to make sure we do something reasonable and don't have folks feel they are continually fighting a system. <br><br> I'd be happy to discuss such issues with anyone interested. </blockquote></P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
There was a rather long discussion, most of thish I did not follow,
since I am not very familiar with RPMs.  People who use Red Hat
systems might find it illuminating.
</P>

<P>
The discussion included a sidetrack about support for version number
literals in Perl 5.6.  You will be able to write 
<CODE>v5.3.40</CODE> and
it will be compiled as if you had written 
<CODE>"\x{5}\x{3}\x{28}"</CODE> instead; this means that (for example) 
<CODE>v5.3.40 lt v5.29.12</CODE> is true.  
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00460.html">The root of this part of the discussion is here.</a></P>

This is getting to be my favorite part of the report, because even if
the rest of the week is a bunch of boring flamage or irrelevant
nattering, there is always something interesting going on in the Ilya
department.  Many thanks to Ilya and Sarathy for tirelessly supplying
me with an endless stream of interesting technical content.

</P>

<P>

<a href="/pub/1999/12/p5pdigest/THISWEEK-19991212.html#Change_to_xsubpp">Last week</a>, Sarathy declined to put in Ilya's improvement to 
<CODE>xsubpp</CODE> unless he also provided a way to turn it off.  
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00359.html">Ilya did this.  </a> There is now an environment variable that will turn it off.

</P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00364.html">Thomas Stromberg reported an interesting bug.  </a> He has a filehandle
through which he is writing to a pipe.  
A 
<CODE>close</CODE> on this filehandle waits for the command on the other end of the pipe
 to terminate.  While his program is doing this, it gets an alarm
signal.  Tom wants to terminate the program and clean up.  If he
simply returns from the signal handler, the 
<CODE>close</CODE> call is restarted and the program hangs again.  So he tries closing
 the filehandle in the signal handler; this make Perl dump core.
</P>

<P>
He supplied a sample test program, but there was no discussion,
perhaps because the sample program uses 
<CODE>/bin/pax</CODE> on the other end of the pipe, or perhaps because everyone knows that
 Perl signal handlers are hopeless.  In any case, I was able to  demonstrate
 the problem by changing 
<CODE>/bin/pax</CODE> to 
<CODE>sleep 10</CODE>.

<P>

<H3><a name="pad_findlex_Needs_to_be_Recursive"><tt>pad_findlex</tt> Needs to be Recursive</a></H3>

<P>
Mr. or Ms. Pixel reported a bug in lexical closures.  Here it is a
demonstration:  
</P>

</P><PRE>
	for (1..5) {
	  my $t = $_;
	  push @subs, sub { sub { $t }};
	}
	
	for (@subs) {
	  print "-- ", &{&$_};
	}
</PRE>

<P>

This should print out 
<CODE>--1--2--3--4--5</CODE>but unfortunately the wrong 
<CODE>$t</CODE> has been captured by the closures.  If you are still not sure that
this is a bug, note that changing 
<CODE>sub { sub { $t }}</CODE> to 
<CODE>sub { $t; sub { $t }}</CODE> produces the correct behavior.  (Thanks to Randy J. Ray and Jeff
Pinyan for pointing this out.)
</P>

<P>
Larry predicts that Sarathy will fix this in the course of rewriting
the pad code for 5.005_64.  Sarathy remained mute.
<H3><a name="Conversion_Specifier_Bug">Conversion Specifier Bug</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Nicholas Clark reported a test failure for 5.005_63:
Warning test #247 was yielding 
<pre>/[a\b]/: Unrecognized escape \ in character class passed through at - line 3.</pre></P>

<P>
 when it should have said
<pre>/[a\zb]/: Unrecognized escape \ in character class passed through at - line 3.</pre> instead.  That does not sound like a big problem, does it?  I
initially filed this in the `not interesting' folder.
</P>

<P>
Robin Barker tracked down the problem.  The variable that held the
missing 
<CODE>z</CODE> character was actually a 
<CODE>UV</CODE>, which is an 
<CODE>unsigned long</CODE>.  But it was being 
<CODE>printf</CODE>'ed with a 
<CODE>%c</CODE> conversion specifier.  On a little-endian machine, this would
probably have
worked properly.  
</P>

<P>
And now you know why we have regression tests.
</P>

<P>
Robin submitted a  
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00456.html">very interesting patch </a> which enables 
<CODE>printf</CODE> format checking throughout the Perl code.  he turned up a number of
potential problems.

<blockquote><b>Fran&ccedil;ois D&eacute;sarm&eacute;nien: </b>Whoa ! This is really the simplest perl program I've ever seen !</blockquote> </P>

<P>

But then it turned out to be interesting after all:  Hans Mulder
pointed out that if you run the Perl test harness and tell it to
execute no tests, it dies with a divide-by-zero error.  Hans submitted
a patch for this.

`New Perl Person to Watch' for December 1999.  Thank you, Ralph.
<H3><a name="Missing_VERSIONs">Missing <tt>$VERSION</tt>s</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Michael Schwern posted a list of 
<i>eighty</i> standard modules that
do not set 
<CODE>$VERSION</CODE>.  He proposed modifying all of them to say that their version was
1.00.  Sarathy objected:
<blockquote><b>Sarathy:</b> What we really need is a mechanism to attach meta-information about a module (in the form of structured pod/XML, for instance).  If done correctly, this would allow modules to "publish" their interfaces for run time type-discovery and other COM/CORBA-like functionality. </blockquote></P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00494.html">Simon Cozens  reported that CTAN is doing something like this.</a></P>

<P>

In the course of this,  
Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen mentioned something I thought was very valuable and should be better
known:  The 
<CODE>CPAN.pm</CODE> module has a 
<CODE>wh</CODE> command.   Try it.
<H3><a name="Overly_magical_range_operator">Overly magical range operator</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Tom Phoenix discovered that the magical range generation operator 
<CODE>..</CODE> is magical even when its second argument is a number:
</P>

</P><PRE>
	@items = "0" .. -1;
	print scalar(@items);
</PRE>

<P>
This prints 100, because the string 
<CODE>"0"</CODE> is autoincremented until its length is greater than the length of 
<CODE>"-1"</CODE>.  He supplied a patch.
<H3><a name="Array::Virtual"><tt>Array::Virtual</tt></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Tim Bunce forwarded a message from Andrew Ford, who is working on an 
<CODE>Array::Virtual</CODE> module that will let him tie a Perl array to a very sparse
memory-mapped array of numbers.  Most of the discussion apparently
went on in the modules mailing list.  This module as been on the
module list in the `idea' stage for a long time.  There was some
discussion about the appropriate calling interface for it.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00458.html">Read about it.</a></P>

<P>

<H3><a name="Reloading_Modules_that_use_fields">Reloading Modules that <tt>use fields</tt></a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Apparently this doesn't work---
<CODE>fields.pm</CODE> tries to insert 
the field names into the 
<CODE>%FIELDS</CODE> array twice.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00446.html">John Tobey provided a patch. </a></P>

 However, there was no discussion.

</P>

<P>
Paul Marquess reported that the file locking strategy suggested by  the 
<CODE>DB_File</CODE> documentation didn't work.  It suggested something like this:
</P>

</P><PRE>
	$db = tie(%db, 'DB_File', ...) or die ...;
	$fd = $db->fd;
	open(DB_FH, "+<&=$fd") or die ...;
	flock (DB_FH, LOCK_EX) or die ...;
	...
	flock(DB_FH, LOCK_UN);
	undef $db;
</PRE>

<P>
Problem: The
<CODE>tie</CODE> itself opens
the file, which causes the stdio library to read and cache some data
from the database.  But this occurs before the file is locked.  
Therefore there is a race condition here.
This
method also appears in the Camel and Ram books.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00111.html">Paul
posted a message describing the problem in detail,</a> including solutions.  One of these solutions is to simply lock some 
<i>other</i>  file instead of the database file itself; this is also a general solution
to many similar problems.  
</P>

<P>
David Harris was the person who originally reported this problem to
Paul.  
<a href="http://www.davideous.com/misc/dblockflaw-1.2/">He has a  detailed description of it online.</a></P>

<P>
Some other miscellaneous discussion of locking followed.  Raphael
Manfredi posted a new version of his 
<CODE>LockFile::Simple</CODE> module that provides simple 
<CODE>lock</CODE> and 
<CODE>unlock</CODE> functions to do advisory locking.  This did not appear in 5.005_63.

<P>

Ilya posed this problem:  He has a module, 
<CODE>Math::Pari</CODE>, which is dynamically loaded.  He wants to be able to say
</P>

</P><PRE>
	use Math::Pari qw(:primelimit=1e8 :stack=20e6 :prec=128);
</PRE>

<P>
and have the 
<CODE>qw(...)</CODE> items affect the initialization of the 
<CODE>Math::Pari</CODE> module, which is done when it is bootstrapped.  But the items are
 passed to the 
<CODE>import()</CODE> function, which is called 
<i>after</i> the module is loaded, bootstrapped, and initialized, and therefore too
 late.  One possibility, advocated by Joshua Pritikin, is to ask the

Last week, Mike Guy complained that the lexing of forms involving 
<CODE>${a[0]}</CODE> and 
<CODE>${h{k}}</CODE> was inconsistent.  (These are in there so that you can force Perl to
 interpret the 
<CODE>[0-9]</CODE> in 
<CODE>/...$a[0-9]/</CODE> as an array subscript rather then a character class.)  Larry supplied
 a patch.
<blockquote><b>Larry: </b>I'm working on this one, in case anyone else
was thinking about it.  Basically, <tt>lex_fakebrack</tt> needs to go
away. <br><b>Ilya:</b> Thanks.  There are not so many <i>totally</i> incomprehensible places in <tt>toke.c</tt>, and<tt>lex_fakebrack</tt> is one of them.   </blockquote> </P>

<P>

I wanted to include the relevant code so that everyone would have a
chance to see what it was that Ilya considers totally
incomprehensible.  But of course this is impossible, because if it
were a small, compact piece of code then it would not have been
totally incomprehensible.  Instead it riddled  
<CODE>toke.c</CODE> like a small but virulent fungus.
<H3><a name="Link_to_dmake">Link to <tt>dmake</tt></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

<CODE>dmake</CODE> is a version of 
<CODE>make</CODE> for win32 systems.  The 
<CODE>README.win32</CODE> file in the perl distribution refers people to a copy of the sources
in one of Sarathy's personal directories at University of Michigan;
 Elaine Ashton asked why there was no link to the official site.
 Sarathy explained that the copy on the official site was severely
broken but that his copy worked properly.  Elaine also asked why
Sarathy's version wasn't in his CPAN directory; Sarathy said he had
not been sure about whether to put it there or not since it was not
directly related to Perl.
</P>

<P>
Mike Guy pointed out that it would not set a new precedent to put such
things on CPAN and suggested that it would be a good idea to put it
there.

</P>

<P>

Ralph Corderoy reported a non-bug:  ``Assigning a  
<CODE>/gx</CODE> regexp to a list breaks 
<CODE>\G</CODE> in the following regexp.''  His example went something like this:
</P>

</P><PRE>
	$s = '123456';
	($a, $b) = $s =~ /(.)(.)/g;    # line 2
	($c, $d) = $s =~ /\G(.)(.)/g;  # line 3
</PRE>

<P>
He wants 
<CODE>$c</CODE> to contain 3 and 
<CODE>$d</CODE> to contain 4.  Instead, they contain 1 and 2.
</P>

<P>
What happened here?  In scalar context, 
<CODE>m//g</CODE> finds one match, starting from where it left off.  However, in list
 context, it finds all the remaining match, and returns a list of all
 the results.   LIine 2 above matched and generated the list 
<CODE>(1,2,3,4,5,6)</CODE>.  It assigned this list to 
<CODE>$a</CODE> and 
<CODE>$b</CODE>, throwing away 3, 4, 5, and 6; then the match on ilne 3 started over
again at the beginning.
</P>

<P>
This recalled  
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-10/msg01047.html">a similar complaint from Randal Schwartz,</a> which I neglected to mention at the time.
<blockquote><b>Ilya Zakharevich:</b> I remember some discussionfor making list context <tt>m//gc</tt> behave differently.  What wasthe result?</blockquote></P>

<P>

Apparently the result was that it was forgotten.  It might be nice to
reopen this.  As Ralph says, ``
<CODE>/g</CODE> means two things (many matches and enable 
<CODE>\G</CODE>), it means
you can't just enable 
<CODE>\G</CODE>.''
</P>

<P>
His second message 
has a very clear statement of the problem, and a
proposal for what to do instead.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00028.html">Read about it.</a><H3><a name="eof_at_the_Beginning_of_the_Input"><tt>eof()</tt> at the Beginning of the Input</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Ralph Corderoy also reported a bug in the 
<CODE>eof()</CODE> operator.  
<CODE>eof()</CODE> gets my award for `obscure feature of the month.'  It is different
 from  just 
<CODE>eof</CODE> with no parentheses, because 
<CODE>eof</CODE> by itself tests the last-read filehandle, but 
<CODE>eof()</CODE> with empty parenthese tests the special null filehandle, the one read
 by 
<CODE><></CODE>.  Anyway, now the bug.  If you call 
<CODE>eof()</CODE> before you've read any input at all, it yields true, and Ralph
thought it should yield false:
</P>

</P><PRE>
	plover% perl -le 'print eof()'
	1
</PRE>

<P>
A bunch of people then posted arguments about why this was actually
correct behavior, or documented behavior, or how Ralph should work
around it, or confused the issue with plain 
<CODE>eof</CODE>.
<blockquote><b>Ralph:</b> But shouldn't <tt>eof()</tt>, associated as it is with the magic <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>, have a little magic of its own and trigger the first getc+ungetc from <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>?  <br>Mb>Larry:</b>  Makes sense to me, as much as <tt>eof()</tt> ever makes sense. </blockquote></P>

<P>

</P>

<P>
Sarathy then reported that 
<CODE>eof()</CODE> was not even behaving as documented, and would in fact apply to the
 least-read filehandle even if it was not 
<CODE>ARGV</CODE>.  He then provided a patch that made it behave as
documented and also fixed Ralph's bug.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<P>

<H3><a name="Shadow_Passwords_Continue">Shadow Passwords Continue</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Discussion continued from last week about the behavior of Perl's 
<CODE>getpw*</CODE> functions on systems with shadow password files.  I said that I'd
follow up this week, but I think the summary I posted last time suffices.
People argued about school #1 vs. school #2.

<H3><a name="Perl_EBCDIC_and_Unicode">Perl, EBCDIC, and Unicode</a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Geoffrey Rommel asked for pointers to docmuentation about unicode
support in Perl so that he could understand the implications for his 
<CODE>Convert::IBM390</CODE> module.   He got two excellent responses:
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg01077.html">James Briggs is writing a document called `Perl, Unicode  and I18N' which he expects to have done by 7 January.</a></P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg01099.html">Peter Prymmer posted some links and pointers to relevant  mailing lists.  </a></P>

<P>
He also suggested that the techniques of the 
<CODE>utf8</CODE> pragma could be adapted to provide an analogous 
<!-- thanks, Jon --><CODE>utfebcdic</CODE> pragma which would enable an EBCDIC internal representation.
<H3><a name="lock_Keyword"><tt>lock</tt> Keyword</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Dan Sugalski observed that the 
<CODE>lock</CODE> keyword is interpreted as a function name if there is any global
variable 
<CODE>main::lock</CODE>, even a scalar.  In this case the 
<CODE>main::lock</CODE> function is invoked.  Sarathy supplied a patch which makes the
determination at compile-time based on the existence of the subroutine 
<CODE>main::lock</CODE>.
<H3><a name="Safe::Hole"><tt>Safe::Hole</tt></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

A few weeks ago, I reported on a new module, 
<a href="/pub/1999/11/p5pdigest/THISWEEK-19991121.html#Safe::Hole"><tt>Safe::Hole</tt></a>.  Mike Heins posted a glowing testimonial for it, so I thought I'd mention it again.
<H3><a name="Change_to_xsubpp">Change to <tt>xsubpp</tt></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Back in early November, I reported:
<blockquote></P>

<P>
Ilya submitted a 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-11/msg00088.html">patch to <code>xsubpp</code></a> which will change the value return semantics of XSUBs to be more
 efficient.  It needs wide testing because almost all XSUBs will
 be affected.
</blockquote></P>

<P>
Sarathy said that it was risky enough that it should be enable only
when explicitly requested; Ilya objected, saying that it needed wide
testing and that if it were only enabled by a command-line argument it
would not receive wide testing.
</P>

<P>
Nick Ing-Simmons then offered to test it with 
<CODE>Tk</CODE>, but I did not see the outcome.  Andreas K&amp;omul;nig tested it with 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/1999-12/msg00077.html">many important modules </a>(including 
<CODE>Tk</CODE>,)
 and reported that it caused no problems that were not already present.

Simon Cozens reported that Freshmeat had announced a programming

easy to learn and outperforms all popular interpreted languages'.  (No

Ilya made some substantial additions to the

document, and some notes about how to detect old versions of Perl.  He
added a lot of details about the contents of

</P>

<P>
Norbert Goevert reported a bug in the way that 
<CODE>ExtUtils::Install</CODE> handles setting the 
<CODE>umask</CODE> value.  This spawned a brief discussion of why 
<CODE>ExtUtils::Install</CODE> was setting the 
<CODE>umask</CODE> in the first place, and therefore specifically overriding the
 permission policy specified by the person running the script.
Sarathy agreed, and patched 
<CODE>installman</CODE>, 
<CODE>installperl</CODE>, 
<CODE>ExtUtils/Install.pm</CODE>, and 
<CODE>ExtUtils/Manifest.pm</CODE> to leave the 
<CODE>umask</CODE> alone.  Hoewever, he said that the right approach would be for these
 programs and modules to check for an inappropriate 
<CODE>umask</CODE> value and issue a warning if it was set to something suspicious.  He
 asked for a patch that would do this, but nobody contributed one.
Nick Ing-Simmons suggested an alternative approach:  
<CODE>Configure</CODE> could ask something like
