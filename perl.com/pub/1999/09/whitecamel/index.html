<br>
<p>The Perl Conference brought us the first "White 
Camel" awards. The White Camel Awards were created to honor individuals who 
devote remarkable creativity, energy, and time to the non-technical work that 
supports Perl's active and loyal user community. The awards were conceived of 
and administered by  <a href="http://www.pm.org">Perl Mongers</a>, a not-for-profit 
organization whose mission is to establish Perl user groups. In addition to Perl 
Mongers, O'Reilly and <a href="http://www.sourceXchange.com">
sourceXchange</a>, sponsored 
the awards.</p> 

<p>I recently had the chance to talk with the winners and ask them a few 
questions about the White Camel awards and their contributions to the Perl 
community.</p>

<h3>Kevin Lenzo</h3>

<p>
<b>You won the "Perl Community" 
White Camel Award for YAPC. Briefly (50 pages or less), what was YAPC and what 
went into planning it?</b></p> 
<p>Yet Another Perl Conference is a grassroots Perl conference, and the first 
one (YAPC 1999) was hosted at Carnegie Mellon University. YAPC 19100 will stay 
in Pittsburgh, incubating here for another year, and then I'd like to find 
another host city somewhere in Eastern North America&#151probably somewhere 
there's a Perl Monger's stronghold near a university.</p> 
<p>The conference was cheap: $60 conference cost, including food, covering the 
two-day event. We actually ran a little short on the budget in the end, but this 
was pried out of me in the closing session, and the community had $1000 on the 
stage in about 30 minutes! You don't see that very often. The next one will 
probably cost a wee bit more, just to avoid the shortfall, but the whole thing 
is intended to be zero profit.</p>
<p>The aim of YAPC is to be an affordable, regional conference, that people can 
get to, and that students, hobbyists and enthusiasts can get to without 
selling their computers. We had some great speakers show up and volunteer their 
time, also&#151I think the speakers did a great job, even when the mechanics of 
the conference occasionally broke down.</p> 
<p>Next year, we have some interesting challenges&#151we're not the best-kept 
secret anymore. Even with double the capacity, I think we will have to turn 
people away, and we'll surely get more talk submissions than we'll be able to 
show. One goal I have is to bring some discussion of the internals and 
directions of Perl itself more to the next YAPC, and from the response so far, 
I'd say we'll be seeing it.</p> 
<p><b>What does receiving the White Camel award mean to you 
personally?</b></p> 
<p>It's pretty overwhelming&#151and I've felt that way ever since the conference. 
In a way it's a physical symbol of the goodwill that almost broke me up at the 
end of YAPC. It's not something one can scheme to get!</p>
<p><b>Does the award mean more to you because you were chosen by your 
peers?</b></p> 
<p>Quite. I feel like I've been elected as a Tribune by my peers, and it's my 
responsibility to carry that trust, and use any power it may grant to battle 
evil magistrates.</p> 
<p><b>Has receiving the award renewed your enthusiasm or have you always been 
active in the Perl community?</b></p> 
<p>I've had increasing activity in the Perl community over the last five or so 
years. I'd like to point out that Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, and mailing 
lists have been really important to me, and I'd say the EFNet IRC channel #perl 
really helped catalyze YAPC. If I have any great involvement, that was the 
gateway to it.</p>
<p>As far as renewing my enthusiasm&#151it had never waned. We do have some 
serious issues ahead of us in carrying Perl to the next level, as a language and 
as a platform. Perhaps my enthusiasm is tempered by the looming due diligence. 
<p><b>How do you think the White Camels will affect the Perl 
community?</b></p> 
<p>I think the awards certainly help raise awareness, both inside and out, of 
the Perl community&#151which appears to be becoming self-aware. This sort of 
recongition certainly helps me when I ask major speakers to come and speak at 
YAPC. The award has, in some ways, legitimized me with respect to Perl, so that 
I can ask about things and speak of it as "for Perl." I think these awards are 
strong indicators to the places folks work, for instance, that their involvement 
with Perl is justified, and I know Carnegie Mellon University took it quite 
seriously. It has both freed me to officially focus, but also has brought 
certain responsibilties. The award made me look "presidential," as they say in 
election years, and that apparent legitimacy helps me work for Perl.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any exciting plans for your new found fame and 
fortune?</b></p> 
<p>Well, just gearing up for the next YAPC. If you've seen any of the Infobot 
work, you know I have an interest in group communication and discussion. Well, 
I'd really like to expose the planning process of YAPC itself through 
interactive means and web sites that can be group-authored. I'd like to see the 
community helping to structure the conference, and give feedback during the 
planning stages&#151to bring groupware to the whole conference planning process. 
It is a community event, after all.</p> 
<p>I'd like to mention one other thing I'm working on here at CMU, though&#151
we're about to release Sphinx, a major speech recognition engine as open 
source, and I'm intending to make a Perl module to go with it, so you can start 
talking to your desktops. Speech isn't good for everything, and there are lots 
of things it's inappropriate for, but it's nice to say "turn on the lights in 
the kitchen." Desktop agents, global communication using the net, and speech 
interaction are going to change the way we work and talk, and I'd like to see 
speech technology available in Perl.</p> 

<h3>Adam Turoff</h3>
</p>
<b>You won the "Perl User Group" 
White Camel Award. What were some of the things you 
did for the Perl community to earn this award?</b></p> 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Founding member of NY.pm 
<li>Founded PHL.pm, with the monthly "social" dinners 
<li>Started the monthly tech meeting series for PHL.pm 
<li>Started the biweekly perl reading group for PHL.pm<br>(at this point, we 
meet 4 weeks/month) 
<li>Started the (mostly) weekly reading group at ISI (my employer). 
<li>Organized the signup lists at TPC2.0 (helping ~2-4 dozen groups form or grow 
IIRC) 
<li>Perl evangelism at general tech events (conferences, LUG meetings) 
<li>Free Stuff!! (Mostly FreeBSD goodies at large events.) 
<li>Hardware scout for pm.org. (Many thousand thank you's to our anonymous donor, 
Elaine Ashton.) 
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>What does receiving the White Camel award mean to you 
personally?</b></p> 
<p>I think it means that the Perl Community is hitting the next level. Two years 
ago, the Perl Community wasn't very well formed, except for groups like p5p and 
other people interested in extending Perl technically. Today, we have three 
categories where people can be rewarded for making non-technical contributions 
to the Perl Community.</p> 
<p>Taking Perl to the next level means bringing Perl to new audiences and in new 
directions. One way to do that is to promote Perl user groups where we are 
interested in discussing common CGI idioms, venting about Microsoft, swapping 
Twilight Zone stories, talking about Postmodernism or sharing really cool 
observations about Perl. All at the same time, of course.</p>  

<p><b>Has receiving the award renewed your enthusiasm or have you always been 
active in the Perl community?</b></p> 
<p>I've been active in the Perl Community since TPC 1.0. [TPC 1.0 is <i>The Perl 
Conference 1.0]</i> 
<p><b>How do you think the White Camels will affect the Perl 
community?</b></p> 
<p>The Perl community is both quite social, very eclectic. I hope that the White 
Camels (specifically the user groups and community awards) will help to 
highlight and encourage user groups everywhere to continue these traditions.</p> 
<p>One of the themes that has been circulating since the conference is that of 
the quiet majority of Perl users. We may not be as big or as vocal as the Java 
or Win* communities, but we use Perl and get the job done without making lots of 
noise. That makes it more difficult to advocate Perl and help it to grow in new 
directions. I hope that over the next few years, Perl advocacy grows and becomes 
more effective and more visible. I can't wait to see the White Camel awards for 
Advocacy over the next few years.</p> 
<p><b>Do you have any exciting plans for your new found fame and 
fortune?</b></p> 
<p>Taking phl.pm out to dinner, and buying an exotic computer or two.</p>  
<p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p>

<p>These were some of the first people who distinguished themselves enough in the 
Perl community to earn the White Camel Awards. These awards were an excellent 
idea, the presence of peer awards such as these will undoubtably affect the Perl 
community. Any Perl programmer out there would be very proud to display their 
own White Camel award. </p>
