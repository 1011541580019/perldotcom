    <TD>Currently I'm Director of Technology at [Paramount Pictures New Media 
      Group,] Paramount Digital Entertainment, primarily in charge of the 
      internet impetus. 
      <P>Our 3 largest properties are the <A 
      href="http://www.startrek.com/">Star Trek site</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.etonline.com/">Entertainment Tonight Online</A>, and the 
      Entertainment Channel on <A href="http://www.netscape.com/">netcenter</A>, 
      which is of course <A href="http://www.netscape.com/">netscape.com</A>. 
      </P>
      <P>We also have several smaller sites, mainly Paramount properties for the 
      TV shows and movies, including <A 
      href="http://www.cluelesstv.com/">Clueless</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.sevendaystv.com/home/">7 days</A>, Late Line, The Howie 
      Mandel Show, Real TV, Frasier, and others. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><I><font color="#000000" size="3">Could you give us a sense of how much traffic 
  these sites get? </font></I></P>

    <TD height="294">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD height="294">Our highest traffic site by far is Star Trek. It consists 
      of a couple of different components: 
      <P></P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The Continuum, which is the fan site, with chat, lots of information 
        about the TV show, episode guides, how to speak Klingon, and other fun 
        things. 
        <LI>The Star Trek store, which is our e-commerce component, where 
        licensed merchandise can be purchased online. 
        <LI>Star Trek mail, a web based free email with Star Trek branding. 
      </LI></UL>
      <P>All told, this site pushes well over 5 million hits per day, a lot of 
      it quite intensive, and much of it cannot be represented in hits (eg. 
      chat, etc). </P>
      <P>Netcenter also gets a lot of hits, because it's a channel on one of the 
      larger portals. </P>
      <P>The Entertainment Tonight site also drives a good amount of traffic, as 
      it is very closely tied to the TV show. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><I><font color="#000000" size="3">I understand you are a big fan of Perl. Can 
  you tell us why? </font></I></P>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>There are a couple of reasons. </P>
      <P>First off, Perl makes it very easy to do what you need to get done. 
      Perl does nearly everything, and also makes it easy to do the task at 
      hand. </P>
      <P>Also, it is rather easy to find and get Perl expertise, as opposed to 
      some of the other development products, such as <A 
      href="http://www.microsoft.com/">ASP</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.allaire.com/">Cold Fusion</A>, or Dynamo, where there is 
      not nearly the sort of technical expertise available as there is for Perl. 
      </P>
      <P>Perl is easy to develop in, gets the task done, is fast, and chances 
      are if there's something to be done, someone has already done it for you. 
      </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><I><font color="#000000" size="3">What about performance? A lot of people are 
  concerned about performance when they use Perl on their web sites. </font><FONT color=#339900 size=3> 
  </FONT></I></P>
<P>
<TABLE border=0>

    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>Performance is a big issue with us. In running a high volume, high 
      availability entertainment presence, we have to be very cognizant of the 
      brand. The Star Trek brand is a very powerful brand, and we cannot have 
      anything on the site that would detract from it. Star Trek implies high 
      technology: things that work. We cannot implement something that would 
      either not work, or be slow. Because we push a lot of volume, performance 
      is our number one concern. </P>
      <P>Perl is, as you know, an interpreted language. The very nature of any 
      CGI programming is that there is a lot of system overhead and bookkeeping 
      with fork and exec, and doing a lot of the internal setup before you even 
      do any of the actual work of the program. </P>
      <P>One of the advantages to <A 
      href="http://www.binaryevolution.com/">Binary Evolution's system</A> is 
      that it's sort of embedded: it embeds the Perl interpreter into the server 
      process. So you see several advantages: you can maintain persistent 
      information. Many of our sites maintain a lot of the information in an 
      Oracle Database. With <A href="http://www.velocigen.com/">VelociGen</A>, 
      the database connections don't have to be created and torn down each time 
      someone does something; they can be maintained in a pool and are available 
      when needed. Also, we don't have to do a fork and exec, as you would when 
      writing CGI's. A lot of the first pass processing is done for you, so 
      really the only thing the CPU has to do is the meat of your progam. This 
      saves us a lot of time, and saves us money, and we don't need as much 
      hardware to do the same amount of stuff. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><I><font color="#000000" size="3">Scripting languages are often touted as decreasing 
  application development time. Does Perl play a part in helping you develop applications 
  quickly? </font></I></P>
<P>

  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      <P>Oh, absolutely. Like any entertainment site, we have a very broad 
      mandate in what we're responsible for. However, more often than not, we 
      are viewed as a cost center, as opposed to a profit center, which means 
      our budget can be severely limited at times. </P>
      <P>Perl makes the cost of development fit within the budget. The 
      development time in making value added enhancements around the margins is 
      very quick for solving the problems at hand, and also it's very easy to 
      maintain programs written in Perl because there is a lot of Perl expertise 
      available. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><I><FONT color=#339900 size=3> <font color="#000000">Are there any other thoughts 
  you want to leave us with? </font></FONT></I></P>

  <TR>
    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>Sure. The thing we care about most is performance, performance, 
      performance. The Star Trek site runs on 4 rather powerful servers with 
      some load balancing hardware sitting in front of it. We noticed that as we 
      tweak performance, the amount of traffic goes up, which means we are not 
      necessarily limited by an interest in the site, or the amount of content 
      that's available, but rather that the faster we can serve pages, the more 
      pages we serve up. 
      <P></P>
      <P>So by getting performance out of the site, we increase, in essence, our 
      revenue, because our revenue is tied directly to traffic. So, rather than 
      buying more hardware, if we can do it with a software solution, which 
      costs a fraction of the price, it's better for us.
