<!-- ActiveState's PerlEx 1.1 Accelerates CGI on Windows/NT  -->
<p>ActiveState Tool Corp of Vancouver, the developers of ActivePerl for Win32, 
  have released version 1.1 of PerlEx. A plug-in for Windows/NT web servers, PerlEx 
  1.1 improves the performance of CGI-based Web applications written in Perl. 
  PerlEx pre-compiles Perl programs and stores this version in memory, which allows 
  the server to process requests more quickly. </p>

<p>Typical Perl-based CGI applications on the Windows/NT platform run one of two 
  ways. The standard way is to call the standalone Perl interpreter for each request. 
  The second way, which is faster, involves using the Perl ISAPI dll that keeps 
  the interpreter running in process with the server. PerlEx can be considered 
  a third way to run CGI applications, which achieves better run-time performance 
  by pre-compiling Perl programs. ActiveState reports performance increases of 
  2 to 30 times over the first two methods. "We have performed tests comparing 
  this latest version to standard Perl CGI and our competitors,&quot; said Dick 
  Hardt, President and CTO of ActiveState Tool Corp. &quot;When it comes to speed, 
  PerlEx significantly outperforms the others." See the results of the <a href="http://www.ActiveState.com/plex/benchmarks.htm">performance 
  testing benchmarks</a> at ActiveState. </p>
<p>In addition, a CGI application programmer can increase performance even more 
  by taking advantage of specific PerlEx features. For example, database connections 
  may be kept open, or a large file may be read and stored in memory, between 
  invocations of a script. The Embed feature in PerlEx 1.1 enables the user to 
  embed Perl in HTML documents, offering server-side scripting capabilities similar 
  to Microsoft's Active Server Pages, or .asp files on Microsoft Internet Information 
  Server. The embedded Perl code is transparent to most commercial HTML editors, 
  making it easy to edit the HTML in the file and immediately see what the page 
  will look like in a browser. </p>
<p>Other new features in PerlEx1.1 include adaptation tools and performance monitoring. 
  The PerlEx adaptation script identifies problems that can cause scripts to behave 
  unexpectedly or fail. Users can simply run the PerlEx adaptation script, and 
  follow the warnings, suggestions, and errors it identifies, to allow their scripts 
  to run without difficulty. PerlEx 1.1 also now offers performance monitoring, 
  which can be used to determine the optimal settings and configuration for PerlEx.</p>
<p>PerlEx runs on all popular commercial Windows NT Web servers, including O'Reilly 
  and Associates' WebSite Professional, Microsoft Internet Information Server 
  (IIS) 3.0 and 4.0, and Netscape FastTrack and Enterprise servers. PerlEx can 
  be downloaded for $395 U.S from ActiveState. A 30-day trial license of PerlEx 
  1.1 is also available. </p>
