<!--  A New Edition of www.perl.com -->


<br>
<p>I'd like to welcome you to this new edition of www.perl.com and tell you
about some of the changes we made to the site.
</p>

<p><b>Easier Navigation</b></p>

<p>We simplified the navigation menu so that it's easy to find the site's
major sections and functions. This menu consists of the following
choices: Download, Documentation, CPAN, FAQS, Marketplace, Features and
Search.

<p><b>New Features for Home Page</b>
</p>

<p>The home page contains a number of new things:
<ul>
<li> several feature articles;</li>

<li> a list of short news items;</li>

<li> a Perl Cookbook recipe of the day;</li>

<li> an area that features a Larry Wall quote which changes when you re-load;</li>

<li> a list of Larry's talks;</li>

<li> a list of new items from Tom Christiansen called Perlland.</li>

<li> a list of commonly asked questions, mainly about the site or about the
Perl market, questions that are not typically answered in the FAQ.</li>
</ul>

You'll also find the Perl Reference on the www.perl.com home page It's
organized as a hierarchy for the topics. An alphabetical list of topics
is also available as a drop-down box on the main menu.
</p>
<p><b>Better Access to Perl Documentation and FAQs</b>
</p>

<p>This new site organizes Perl documentation, improving format and consistency
of the HTML versions of Perl man pages as well as the FAQs.
We hope this makes the core documentation more accessible for those who
want to use it in a Web browser. We've also catalogued
the individual documentation files so that you will be able to search for
them more easily.
</p>

<p><b>Combined Search</b>
</p>

<p>The site's search engine now looks across the site to return documentation,
feature articles as well as items found in the Perl Reference.
The engine is not very efficient right now but we'll work on it.
We intend to provide a better search engine soon.
</p>

<p><b>Improved Download Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>A lot of new users stumble through the process of downloading Perl.
We've re-written the download instructions in hopes that new users will
find it easier select the right source or binary to download.
</p>

<p><b>New Perl Marketplace</b>
</p>

<p>This version of www.perl.com now has the Perl Marketplace, in which
you'll find new products and services for the Perl community.
Our coverage isn't complete yet, so let us know if there are products which
should be listed.
<p>Please let me know what you like and don't like about the new
version. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Dale

  <P>
<!::field::id-author::before=By+::> </P>   <P>The next version of Perl will be known as 5.6 instead of 5.006 (or 5.1). In 
  this interview, Gurusamy Sarathy explains what new features you might expect 
  in Perl 5.6. Sarathy holds the <a href="/pub/qa/What_is_the_patch_pumpkin?">patch 
  pumpkin</a> for this release. Sarathy is joined by Dick Hardt who elaborates 
  on how some of the new developments improve Perl on the Windows platform. Sarathy 
  and Hardt are from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState Tools Corp</a>.The 
  Perl Porters group is putting together all the alpha-stage components for Perl 
  5.6, which should be available as a beta in mid-August.</P>
<P>This inteview also includes two RealAudio clips, one in which Sarathy discusses 
  threading in Perl and the other in which he explains the compiler models used 
  in Perl.</P>

  <!-- <A NAME="versions"></A>Changing Perl's Version Numbering --> 
  <P CLASS="question"><B>Perl.com</B>: Explain the new version-numbering
  system.</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>: By tradition, we increment the third digit in the version number. 
  (5.005, for example.) It carried forward from the days of Perl 4 when we had 
  patch levels and sub-versions that would be conveniently represented as floating 
  point numbers. We had carried forward the convention for ease of comparing version 
  numbers. </P> 
  
<P>It has been increasingly obvious that people are not recognizing the significance 
  of a new release. So it makes sense to increment the version numbers to the 
  most significant digit. We had to decide between calling it 5.1 and 5.6. We 
  thought that 5.1 might get confused with 5.001. So that's why we ended up with 
  5.6.</P>
  <P><B>Perl.com</B>: Are the Perl Porters behind this change?</P>
  <P><EM>GS</EM>: Yes. Actually, this change was suggested by Larry.</P>
  
<P>The change will allow us to represent version numbers as a sequence of three 
  numbers instead of as a single floating point number. This is similar to numbering 
  used for the Linux kernel where you have triples such as 2.2.3. We think this 
  will help Perl conform to some conventions that are emerging in the Open Source 
  community. </P>
  <P CLASS="question"><B>Perl.com</B>:Just to be sure, what would the first
  revision to 5.6 be called?</P>
  
<P><em>GS</em>: The first revision to 5.6 would be 5.6.1. We might stick to using 
  even numbers for development releases and odd numbers for maintenance releases. 
</P>
<h4>Update</h4>
<P>Jeffrey Friedl asks: &quot;What will be the major revision after 5.9? I've 
  heard Larry say that there will probably never be a Perl 6, but 5.10 would break 
  the ability to compare version numbers easily.&quot; </P>
<P><em>GS</em>: The idea is to overload version number comparisons in a transparent 
  way so things like $] > v5.9.3 would be possible. Larry's idea was to use a 
  packed unicode string and make version numbers dual-valued (like $!), but we 
  might pick a different scheme based on what works out. The bottom line is that 
  there will be an easy (possibly transparent) way to compare such version numbers.</P>
  
  <!-- <A NAME="unicode"></A>System-level Unicode Support --> 
  <P><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: How will Perl extend its support for
  Unicode in 5.6?</P>
  <P><EM>DH</EM>: The code that's in Perl now allows Perl to manipulate its
  own data that may be in UTF 8 format, which is one of the representations for
  Unicode. The work that we're adding allows Perl to interact when passing data
  back and forth between Perl and the system. In this case, we're talking about
  Windows NT and adding support for Perl exchanging data with the system.</P>
  <P>Initial support for Unicode in Perl was driven by XML but it was
  something that a lot of us have wanted in Perl anyway. That was the straw that
  got the camel going, so to speak.</P> 
  <H2><A NAME="lexical"></A>Better Lexical Warnings</H2>
  <P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: How is Perl providing
  greater control over its warning messages?</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>: You want to be able to control at a fine-grained level the kind 
  of warnings that Perl will emit and the kind of warnings that it will suppress, 
  if need be. Right now, warning control in 5.005 is a global switch. You either 
  have it on or you don't. You can control warnings locally using a special variable 
  but you cannot decide between having some warnings and not having others. </P>
  <P>With lexical warnings, you can actually exclude classes of warnings. So
  it provides much greater control of warnings. It also provides a way to promote
  warnings into fatal errors. </P>
  <H2><A NAME="regexp"></A>New Regular Expression Syntax</H2>
  <P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: In 5.6, there are
  interesting changes that make regular expressions more powerful.</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>:You will be able to match balanced tokens, such as beginning and 
  ending tags in XML tags or balanced parentheses. There is a new control construct 
  that can be used in regular expressions. You can embed Perl code in regular 
  expressions. You can capture the state of a regular expression at any given 
  time and store it in Perl code, and then have that Perl code executed based 
  on whether something is matched by the expression. So you can use that mechanism 
  to maintain the state of regular expression engine. Rudimentary support for 
  that was available in 5.005 but it's been greatly improved since then. </P>
  
<P>It can be hard to use but it has great power. It can be used for a large category 
  of things that were previously unexplored. The end result is to make more classes 
  of operations easy to achieve using Perl regular expressions. It is something 
  of an exploratory feature at this point, but it is also something that is not 
  there in any other language I'm aware of.</P>
<P>Here's an example from perlre.pod that shows how balanced parenthesized groups 
  can be matched.</P>
<pre> $re = qr{
           \( 
           (?: 
              (?> [^()]+ ) # Non-parens without backtracking 
            | 
              (?p{ $re    }) # Group with matching parens 
            )* 
            \) 
          }x; 
 print $& if "abc(def(),ghi());" =~    $re; 
__END__ 
(def(),ghi()) <br></pre>
<p><br>
  The (?p{ EXPR }) syntax can interpolate arbitrary expressions at run time into 
  a regular expression. The above snippet sets up a recursive definition of the 
  regular expression which adapts the number of actual levels of parenthesis in 
  the string that is being matched.</p>
<a name="thread"><h2>Improved Threading</h2></a>
<P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: How will the
  threading model change in 5.6?</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>: The experimental threading support that's been there since 5.005 
  has been something of a problem. We've realized that the model we've used has 
  some shortcomings. It has had a performance penalty that's quite serious. We've 
  been discussing alternate ways to achieve threading and do most of what the current model does and have explicit controls for sharing data, which eliminate 
  much of the performance bottleneck that Perl is suffering today.</P>
  <P> There will probably be some user visible changes to how the threading
  is currently used but we are willing to look at both the original threading
  model and the current one as they evolve and understand the tradeoffs to make
  it work for everyone. </P>
  <H3>How does it compare to Java's threading model?</H3>
  
<P>Listen to Sarathy's answer:<A HREF="http://g2.songline.com:8080/ramgen/perl.com/Perl_5.6/threads.rm">Real 
  link </A></P>
  <H2><a name="compiler"></a>Improved Compiling</H2>
  <P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: What about the Perl
  compiler?</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>:The compiler has seen a number of improvements since 5.005. They 
  have been incremental improvements mostly. In terms of usability, the compiler 
  was almost unusable for real work in 5.005 and we said as much in the release 
  notes. In 5.6, it will be much more usable. We have been running the test suites 
  and have had much more success. People have been pounding on it. The byteloader, 
  for example, will work much better because there are dedicated people devoted 
  to that particular activity. </P>
  <P>Compiler work struggled there for a bit because Malcom Beattie had left
  active development of the compiler. Other people are beginning to take over the
  work and seriously develop it. We are hoping for a serious improvement in
  compiler support. </P>
  
<h3 CLASS="question">Can you briefly describe Perl's compiler model?</h3>
<P>Listen to Sarathy's answer:<A HREF="http://g2.songline.com:8080/ramgen/perl.com/Perl_5.6/compiler.rm">link 
  to Real</A> (2:05)</P>
  <H2><A NAME="event"></A>Event Loop</H2> 
  <P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: There is work being
  done on supporting an event loop for GUI processing.</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>: There is an increasing need for an event loop model that is supported 
  at the language level, and one that will be portable across platforms. Tk needs 
  an event loop for dispatching user interface events, and Perl needs to having 
  something parallel to Tcl, which has an event loop within the language. </P>
  
<P>The event loop has been discussed separately as an extension to Perl. It has 
  its own mailing list. I'm not sure it will make it into Perl 5.6 as a core feature. 
  Progress is being made on this work but I don't know when it will be done.</P>
  <H2><A NAME="package"></A>Zip Packaging</H2>
  <P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: Will there be support
  for Zip packaging of code?</P>
  <P><EM>GS</EM>: There is a patch that exists right now but it is not very
  portable. </P>
  <P><EM>DH</EM>: You want to have the capability, like you have in Java, of
  distributing code as one big Zip file. For a standard install, you can move a
  small number of files as opposed to a huge structure. Also, it lowers the disk
  space and makes maintenance a lot easier.</P>
  <P CLASS="question"><B CLASS="question">Perl.com</B>: Does this enable
  automatic download of Perl modules?</P>
  <P><EM>DH</EM>: No. That's something different. The Perl Package manager is
  a way to distribute packages dynamically. We wrote that for the Windows
  platform and provided the code as Open Source and now it's starting to be used
  on Unix platforms. I think there will be advancements in that area as people
  step up to solve some of the problems they have.</P>
  <H2><A NAME="end"></A>Conclusion</H2>
  <P CLASS="question"><B>Perl.com</B>: Are the features we've discussed in
  the development release now?</P>
  
<P><EM>GS</EM>: Some of them are in various stages of implementation and are in 
  the development release. This includes the compiler support and some of the 
  thread support. But others exist outside of Perl as patches that are passed 
  around for the Perl Porters.</P>
  <P CLASS="question"><B>Perl.com</B>: What's the timeframe for the beta?</P>
  
<P><em>GS</em>: There will definitely be a beta release by the time of the O'Reilly 
  Perl and Open Source Conference. Soon after the Conference, we should finish 
  up the work.</P>
  <P CLASS="question"><B>Perl.com</B>: Is the beta release the same as a
  development release?</P>
  
<P><EM>DH</EM>: No, a developer release is still where there's missing parts. 
  The developer release is really for people who are working on the release so 
  that they can work <EM>with</EM> it. Once we've gone beta, there will be a feature 
  freeze. It will be called 5.6 beta and announced to the general public, not 
  just the development community. </P>
