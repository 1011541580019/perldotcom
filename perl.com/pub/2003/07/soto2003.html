<p> This is the 7th annual State of the Perl Onion speech, wherein I tell you
how Perl is doing.  Perl is doing fine, thank you.  Now that that's out of the
way, I'd like to spend the rest of the time telling jokes.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide1.jpg" width="499" height="375" />

<p>In fact, the conference organizers have noticed that I spend most of the
time telling jokes.  So each year they give me a little less time, so I have to
chop out more of the serious subject matter so as to leave time for the
jokes.</p>

<p>Extrapolating several years into the future, they'll eventually chop my time
down to ten seconds.  I'll have just enough time to say: "I'm really, really
excited about what is happening with Perl this year. And I'd like to announce
that, after lengthy negotiations, Guido and I have finally decided...
&lt;gong&gt; ["Time's up. Next speaker please"]</p>

<p>Well, you didn't really want to know that anyway...</p>

<p>Since this is a State of the Union speech, or State of the Onion, in the
particular case of Perl, I'm supposed to tell you what Perl's current state is.
But I already told you that the current state of Perl is just fine.  Or at
least as fine as it ever was.  Maybe a little better.</p>

<p>But what you really want to know about is the future state of Perl.  That's
nice.  I don't know much about the future of Perl.  Nobody does.  That's part
of the design of Perl 6.  Since we're designing it to be a mutable language, it
will probably mutate.  If I did know the future of Perl, and if I told you,
you'd probably run away screaming.</p>

<p>As I was meditating on this subject, thinking about how I don't know the
future of Perl, and how you probably don't <em>want</em> to know it anyway, I was
reminded of a saying that I first saw posted in the 1960's.  You may feel like
this on some days.</p>

<blockquote><p>We the unwilling,<br />
led by the unknowing,<br />
are doing the impossible<br />
for the ungrateful.<br />
We have done so much for so long with so little<br />
We are now qualified to do anything with nothing</p></blockquote>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide2.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="blue collar" />

<p>I think of it as the Blue-Collar Worker's Creed.</p>

<p>This has been attributed to various people, none of whom are Ben Franklin,
Abraham Lincoln, or Mark Twain.  My favorite attribution is to Mother Teresa.
She may well have quoted it, but I don't think she coined it, because I don't
think Mother Teresa thought of herself as "unwilling".  After all, Mother
Teresa got a Nobel prize for being one of the most willing people on the face
of the earth.</p>

<p>It's also been attributed to the Marines in Vietnam, and it certainly 
    fits a little better. But since I grew up in a Navy town, I'd like to 
    think it was invented by a civilian shipyard worker working for the 
    Navy. In any event, I first saw it posted in a work area at Puget Sound 
    Naval Shipyard back in the 1960's. Now, you may well wondering what 
    I was doing in a Naval Shipyard in the 1960's. That's a secret.</p>

<p>Anyway, you may also be wondering why I brought it up at all.  Well, last
year I used the table of contents from an issue of Scientific American as my
outline.  This year I'd like to use this as my outline.</p>

<p>I'd like to, but I won't.</p>

<p>But if I did, here's what I'd say.</p>

<p>From the postmodern point of view, this is a text that needs to be
deconstructed.  It was obviously written by someone in a position of power
pretending not to be.  And by making light of the plight of blue collar
workers, and allowing the oppressed workers to post this copy-machine meme in
the workplace, this white-collar wolf in blue-collar sheep's clothing has
managed to persuade the oppressed workers that being powerless is something to
be proud of.</p>

<p>Now, some of you young folks are too steeped in postmodernism to know 
    anything about postmodernism, so let's review. Postmodernism in its 
    most vicious form started out with the notion that there exist various 
    cultural constructs, or texts, or memes, that allow some human beings 
    to oppress other human beings. Of course, in Soviet Russia it's the 
    other way around. Which is why they managed to deconstruct themselves, 
    I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway, deconstructionism is all about throwing out the bad cultural memes,
where "bad" is defined as anything an oppressed person doesn't like.  Which is
fine as far as it goes, but the spanner in the works is that you can only be an
oppressed person if the deconstructionists say you are.  Dead white males need
not apply.  Fortunately, I'm not dead yet.  Though I'm trying.  As some of you
know, several weeks ago I was in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer.  I guess
I'm a little like Soviet Russia.  I oppress myself, so I deconstruct
myself.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, I got better.  In case you hadn't noticed.</p>

<p>Though I'm not allowed to drink anything brown anymore.  Sigh. That's why
this speech is so boring &mdash; I wrote it under the non-influence.</p>

<p>But back to postmodernism.  Postmodern critics have invented a notation for
using a word and denying its customary meaning at the same time, since most
customary meanings are oppressive to someone or other, and if not, they ought
to be.  Or something like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm going to borrow that notation for my own oppressive purposes,
and strike out a few of these words that don't mean exactly what I want them to
mean.  I hope that doesn't make me a postmodern critic.  Or maybe it does.  As
Humpty Dumpty said, the question is who's to be master, that's all.</p>

<p>So let's start by striking out "unwilling", because there are quite a few
willing people around here.  Or at least willful.</p>

<p>And let's strike out "unknowing" too, because you wouldn't be sitting here
listening to us leaders here tonight if you thought we didn't know anything.
On the other hand, maybe you just came for the jokes...</p>

<p>Now let's strike out the "impossible".  Actually, I hesitate to strike that
one out, because what we're trying to do with Perl is to be all things to all
people, and in the long run that is completely impossible, technically,
socially, and theologically speaking.</p>

<p>But that doesn't stop us from trying.  And who knows, maybe more of it is
possible than we imagine.</p>

<p>We definitely have to strike out ungrateful, because we know many people are
grateful.  Nevertheless, a number of people find it impossible to be grateful,
and we should be working to please them as well.  Love your enemies, and all
that.  Another impossible task.  Or... perhaps the same one.</p>













<p>I like to please people who did not expect to be pleased.  One day when I
was a lot younger than I am now, I performed a piece on my violin.  A lady came
up to me afterward and said, "You know, I don't like the violin.  But I liked
that."</p>

<p>I treasure that sort of compliment, just as I treasure the email messages
that say, "I had given up on computer programming because it wasn't any fun,
and then I discovered Perl."  That's what I mean when I say we should work to
please the people who don't expect to be grateful.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to our Creed here.  I can't see anything wrong with the last
two lines.  In fact, they're directly applicable.</p>

<blockquote><p>We have done so much for so long with so little</p></blockquote>

<p>That's Perl 5.</p>

<blockquote><p>We are now qualified to anything with nothing.</p></blockquote>

<p>That's Perl 6.  I suppose I need to strike that out too, since it doesn't
really exist yet, except in our heads.</p>

<p>Well, maybe that's not such a bad outline after all.  Let's talk a little
more about those things.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide10.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="the unwilling" />

<blockquote><p>We the unwilling</p></blockquote>

<p>Here in the open source community, we're willing to help out, but that's
because we're <em>not</em> willing to put up with the status quo.  And that's
generally due to our inflated sense of Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris.  But
then a really funny thing happens.  A number of us will get together and agree
about something that needs doing because of our Laziness, Impatience, and
Hubris, and then we'll start working on that project with a great deal of
industriousness, patience, and humility, which seem to be the very opposite
qualities to those that motivated us in the first place.</p>

<p>I've tried to figure out a rationale for that, but I've pretty much come to
the conclusion that it's not rational or reasonable.  It's just who we are.
Here's a favorite quotation of mine.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the
unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.  Therefore
all progress depends on the unreasonable man."</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that all of us agree that this is true.  We just can't always agree
on what to be unreasonable about.  Of course, this was written by George
Bernard Shaw, who had his own ideas of the most reasonable ways to be
unreasonable.  This is, after all, the guy who wrote Pygmalion, upon which the
musical My Fair Lady was based, with dear old 'Enry 'Iggins and Eliza Dolit'le
going at each other's throats.  And over linguistics of all things.  Fancy
that.</p>

<p>The only problem with this quote is that it's false.  A lot of progress
comes from unreasonable women.</p>

<p>Well, okay, maybe Shaw meant "he or she" when he only said "he".  Still, if
we're going to please unreasonable people in the twenty-first century, maybe we
need to rewrite it like this:</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide11.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="strike out man and him" />

<p>On the other hand, some people are impossible to please.  We should probably
just strike out "George Bernard Shaw" since he's a dead white male.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide13.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="unknowing" />

<blockquote><p>We the unwilling, led by the unknowing</p></blockquote>

<p>That's me all over.  Which is what the bug said after he hit the
windshield.</p>

<p>Or as the bug's friend said, "Bet you don't have the guts to do that
again."</p>

<p>Whether I have the guts to do Perl again is another question.  My guts are
still in sad shape at the moment, according to the doctor...</p>

<p>Anyway, back to "me the unknowing".  I admit that there's an awful lot that
I don't know.  I'd love to tell you how much I don't know, but I don't know
that either.</p>

<p>So I'll have to talk about what I know instead.  If you are so inclined, you
may infer that I am totally oblivious to anything I don't talk about today.</p>













<p>One thing I do know about is the universal architectural diagram.  It looks
like this.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be chartreuse.  How about pink, to match the fireworks up
in the corner.  I put the fireworks up in the corner there in case you missed
the fireworks on the 4th of July.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide14.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="pink" />

<p>Anyway, this is the universal architectural diagram because you can
represent almost any architecture with it, if you try hard enough.  Here's a
common enough one:</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide15.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="CPU" />

<p>Here we have a bus that's common across the other three components of our
computer, the memory, the CPU, and the I/O system.  Within the computer we have
other entities such as strings, which you can view either as a whole or as a
sequence of characters.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide16.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="string" />

<p>An integer is just like a string, only it's a sequence of bits.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide17.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="integer" />

<p>We can go from very small ideas like integers to very large ideas like
government:</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide18.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="government" />

<p>Or even alternate forms of government.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide19.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="Borg" />













<p> The diagram is even more versatile because you can rotate it on its
side.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide20.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="plain" />

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide21.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="right" />

<p>Now, for some reason, this particular orientation seems to engender the most
patriotism.  It might just be accidental, but if you color it like this</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide22.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="flag" />

<p>people start thinking about saluting it.  Kinda goes with the fireworks, I
guess.</p>

<p>A little more dangerous is this diagram.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide23.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="object" />

<p>It's amazing how many people will salute that one.  And people will even go
to war for this one:</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide24.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="class" />

<p>But you know, the whole notion of objects like this is that there are ways
in which you treat them as a single thing, and ways in which you treat them as
multiple things.  Every structured object is wrapped up in its own identity.
That's really what this little diagram is getting at.</p>

<p>Well, let's keep rotating it and see what we get.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide26.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="rotate" />

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide27.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="God" />

<p>Okay, if you happen to be a Christian of the trinitarian persuasion like me,
then you believe that God is a structured object that is simultaneously
singular and plural depending on how you look at it.  Of course, nobody ever
fights about that sort of thing, right?</p>













<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide28.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="plain" />

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide29.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="left" />

<p>It's kind of unusual to see the diagram in this orientation, probably due to
linguistic considerations.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide30.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="one out of many" />

<p>But whether you say "one out of many" or "e pluribus unum",</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide31.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="pluribus" />

<p>it means much the same thing.  In a language that reads left to right,
perhaps it's more naturally suited to processes that lose information, such as
certain kinds of logic.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide32.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="or" />

<p>Again, we can go from the very small to the very large.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide33.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="black hole" />

<p>If you feed three random planets to a black hole, you also lose information.
Or at least you hide it very well, depending on your theory of how black holes
work.</p>

<p>If you feed one of these diagrams to a black hole, it turns into a piece of
spaghetti.</p>

<p>But let's not, and say we did.</p>













<p>Oddly enough, what I'd really like to talk about today is Perl.  If we look
at our goal for the Parrot project, it looks something like this.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide37.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="Borg Parrot" />

<p>Oops, wrong slide.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide38.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="Parrot" />

<p>That is, Parrot is designed to be a single engine upon which we can run both
Perl 5 and Perl 6.  And... stuff.  Admittedly, this is a rather Perl-centric
view of reality, to the extent you can call this reality.</p>

<p>Well, okay, I'll cheat and show you the other stuff we'd like to do.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide39.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="detail" />

<p>We'd also like to support, for example, PHP, Ruby, Python, BASIC, Scheme,
COBOL, Java, Befunge, TECO, Rebol, REXX, and... I can't quite make out that one
on the bottom there.  And if I could, I wouldn't say it anyway, because there
are children present, and I wouldn't want to fuck up their brains.</p>


<p>Okay, I admit this is not quite reality yet.  I just put in all those
languages because I'm a white male who is trying to oppress you before I'm
quite dead.  So I'd better strike out a few things that aren't really there
yet.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide40.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="strikes" />

<p>Could I interest you in a really fast BASIC interpreter?</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide41.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="Parrot + BASIC" />

<p>Well, it's time to move on to our next point.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide42.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="impossible" />

<blockquote><p>We the unwilling, led by the unknowing, are doing the
impossible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is what we're doing really impossible?  It's possible.  But we won't know
till we try.  More precisely, till we finish trying.  Sometimes things seem
impossible to us, but maybe that's just because we're all slackers.</p>

<p>And because we oversimplify. </p>













<p>Let's take another look at the pink tennis court.  I mean, the universal
architectural diagram.  It really isn't quite as universal as I've made it out
to be.  First, let's get rid of the pink.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide43.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="black" />

<p>Maybe I should give equal time to blue.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide44.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="blue" />

<p>Nah.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide43.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="black" />

<p>Anyway, as I was saying, this isn't universal enough.  Here's the real
universal diagram.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide46.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="line widget" />

<p>This is what's known as an impossible object.  I like it.  I'm impossible
object oriented.  This particular impossible object is often called a widget.
But you knew that already.</p>

<p>What you might not have known is that, up till now, it's been thought
impossible to color such an object accurately.  But as you can see,</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide47.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="colorized" />

<p>that is false.  There are still some perceptual difficulties with it, but
I'm sure <em>that</em> problem is just a relic of our reptile brain.  Or was it our
bird brain.  I forget.  In any event, if you have trouble perceiving this
object correctly, just use the universal clarification tool.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide48.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="cloud" />

<p>I'll assume you can supply your own cloud from now on.</p>

<p>Should be easy here in Portland... I'm allowed to make jokes about Portland
because I grew up in the Pacific Northwet.</p>













<p>As you can see, this more accurate universal architectural diagram can
actually be rotated in 3-d with properly simulated lighting.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide49.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="rotate" />
<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide50.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="rotate" />
<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide51.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="rotate" />
<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide52.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="rotate" />

<p>It's extensible.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide53.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="6comb" />

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide54.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="12comb" />

<p>Comb structures are important in a programming language.  That's why we're
adding a switch statement to Perl 6.</p>

<p>It's also a more accurate representation of Parrot.</p>

<p>It's also more sophisticated linguistically.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide56.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="widget" />

<p>Not only can it represent singular and plural concepts, but also the 
    old Indo-European notion of dual objects.</p>

<p>We still have vestiges of that in English.</p>

<p>On to the ungrateful undead.</p>

<p>There's been a lot of carping lately about how slow Perl 6 development is
going.  Some of it comes from well intentioned folks, but some of it comes from
our poison pen pals who live in the troll house.  Still, I think a lot of the
criticism shows a lack of understanding of the basic laws of development.
These laws can be illustrated with this diagram:</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide61.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="widget" />

<p>Basically, perfect development is impossible.  Development can be fast,
good, and cheap.  Pick two.</p>

<p>Actually, that's unrealistic. </p>

<p>Pick one.</p>

<p>Which one would you pick?  You want fast?  You want cheap?  No, I think you
want this one.</p>

<p>Good.</p>













<p>Good design is neither fast nor cheap.  Every time we crank out a new chunk
of the design of Perl 6 or of Parrot, it's a bit like writing a master's
thesis.  It's a lot of reading, and a lot of writing, and a lot of thinking,
and a lot of email, and a lot of phone conferences.  It's really complicated
and multidimensional.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide62.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="escher" />

<p>There's a lot going on behind the scenes that you don't hear about every
day.  Many people have sacrificed to give us time to work on these things.
People have donated their own time and money to it.  O'Reilly and Associates
have donated phone conferences and other infrastructure.  The Perl 6 design
team in particular has borne a direct financial cost but also a tremendous
opportunity cost in pursuing this at the expense of career and income.  I'm not
looking for sympathy, but I want you to know that I almost certainly could have
landed a full-time job 20 months ago if I'd been willing to forget about Perl
6.  I'm extremely grateful for the grants the Perl Foundation has been able to
give toward the Perl 6 effort.  But I just want you to know that it's costing
us more than that.</p>

<p>But Perl 6 is all about freedom, and that's why we're willing to pledge our
lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.</p>

<p>Times are tough, and I'm not begging for more sacrifice from you good folks.
I just want to give a little perspective, and fair warning that at some point
soon I'm going to have to get a real job with real health insurance because I
can't live off my mortgage much longer.  It's bad for my ulcer, and it's bad
for my family.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the basic design of Perl 6 is largely done, appearances to the
contrary notwithstanding.  Damian and I will be talking about that in the Perl
6 session later in the week.</p>

<p>Well, enough ranting.  I don't want to sound ungrateful myself, because I'm
not.  In any event, the last three years have been extremely exciting, and I
think the coming years will be just as interesting.</p>

<p>In particular, I have a great announcement to make at the end of my talk
about what's going to be happening next.  But let me explain a bit first what's
happened, again using our poor, abused widget.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide63.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="implementations" />

<p>In this case, time is flowing in the upward direction.</p>

<p>Originally we just had one implementation of Perl, and the general
perception as we started developing Perl 6 was that we were going to have two
implementations of Perl.</p>

<p>But in actual fact, we're going to have at least three implementations of
Perl.</p>

<p>First, the good old Perl 5 that's based on C,  And on the right, the Perl 6
that's based on Parrot.  But there in the middle is a Perl5 that is also based
on Parrot.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide64.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="ellipses" />

<p>Note that the left two are the same language, while the right two share the
same platform.</p>

<p>So what's that Perl 5 doing there in the middle?  If you've been following
Perl 6 development, you'll know that from the very beginning we've said that
there has to be a migration strategy, and that that strategy has two parts.
First, we have to be able to translate Perl 5 to Perl 6.  If that were all of
it, we wouldn't need the middle Perl there.  But not only do people need to be
able to translate from Perl 5 to Perl 6, it is absolutely crucial that they be
allowed to do it piecemeal.  You can't translate a complicated set of modules
all at once and expect them to work.  Instead, we want people to be able to run
some of their modules in Perl 5, and others in Perl 6, all under the same
interpreter.</p>

<p>So that's one good reason to have a Perl 5 compiler for Parrot.  Another
good reason is that we expect Perl 5 to run faster on Parrot, by and large.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide65.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="hands" />

<p>Yet another reason is that we have a little bootstrapping issue with the
Perl 6 grammar.  The Perl 6 grammar is defined in Perl 6 regexes.  But those
regexes are parsed with the Perl 6 grammar.  Catch 22.  The solution to this
involves two things.  First, a magical module of Damian's that translates Perl
6 regexes back into Perl 5 regexes.  Second, a Perl 5 regex interpreter to run
those regexes.  Now, it'd be possible to do it with old Perl 5, but it'll be
cleaner to run it with the new Perl 5 running on Parrot.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide66.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="widget" />













<p>Now, it's awfully cumbersome to keep saying "Perl 5 over Parrot" and such,
so we need to do some namespace cleanup here.  We can drop the "over Parrot"
for Perl 6, because that's redundant.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide67.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="drop parrot" />

<p>Likewise, people always think of the original when we say "Perl 5".</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide68.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="drop C" />

<p>That means we need a code name for this thing in the middle.  We've decided
to call it "Ponie".</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide69.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="Ponie" />

<p>We have lots of reasons to call it that.  To be sure, none of them are
<em>good</em> reasons, but I'm told it will make the London.pm'ers deliriously happy
if I say, "I want a Ponie".</p>

<p>And I do want a Ponie.  "I want the Ponie, I want the whole Ponie.  I want
it now."</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide71.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="versions" />

<p>The plan is to for Ponie version 5.10 to be a drop-in replacement for Perl
5.10.  Eventually there will be a Ponie 5.12, and if Ponie is good enough,
there may not be an old-fashioned 5.12.  We'll just stop with 5.10.</p>

<p>So we're gonna start on Ponie right now.  Since I've been carping about lack
of resources, you might wonder how we're gonna do this.</p>

<p>Well, as it happens, a nice company called Fotango has a lot of Perl 5 code
they want to run on Parrot, and they are clued enough to have authorized one of
their employees, our very own Arthur Bergman, to spend company time porting
Perl 5 to Parrot.</p>

<p>Is that cool or what?  I'm out of time, so read the press release.  But I'm
really excited by our vision for the future, and if you're not excited, maybe
you need to have your vision checked.</p>

<img src="/pub/2003/07/16/graphics/slide72.jpg" width="499" height="375" alt="vision" />

<p>Thanks for listening, and I hope that from now on you'll all be completely
unreasonable.</p>
