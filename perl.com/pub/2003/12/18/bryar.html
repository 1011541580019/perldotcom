<p>Recently we heard from Kake Pugh about the <a href="/pub/a/2003/10/31/openguides.html">OpenGuides
project</a>, a wiki-based collaborative city guide system; previously,
we heard from Brian Ingerson about his Kwiki wiki implementation.
Guides, wikis, blogs ... the new fashion in software engineering at
the moment is the use of software to help organize, document, and
facilitate collaboration -- the social software movement is gaining
momentum, and Perl is one of the best languages for it.</p>

<p>In this article we'll look not just at some of the existing
social software tools in Perl (focusing, naturally, on my own Bryar
blog toolkit), but we'll look at some ways to break, bend, and embed
them in other tasks.</p>

<h3><a name="Basic_Blogging_with_Blosxom" id="Basic_Blogging_with_Blosxom"
>Basic Blogging with Blosxom</a></h3>


<p>When I finally decided that the world would benefit from hearing my
internal monologue, I naturally looked around for nice, simple
blogging programs.  Blogs are, essentially, simple things, and so I
didn't want all-singing, all-dancing web-based
database-backed content management systems.  I knew that if I were
going to blog, it would have to be easy for me to do so, and
there's nothing easier than firing up a text editor in the next
available terminal window and doodling my thoughts into it.</p>

<p>
Thankfully, <a href="http://www.raelity.org/">Rael Dornfest</a> has
the same sort of laziness as I, and created <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a>, a very simple blogging
tool, which simply reads a bunch of files from the file system, finds
the most recent and relevant, packages them up together, and sends
them at a browser. That was how I saw blogging.
</p>


    <p>Getting Blosxom up and running is, in keeping with the whole
    theme of Blosxom, quite simple. You need to download the <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/downloads/blosxom.zip">blosxom zip
    file</a>, unpack it, drop the <code>blosxom.cgi</code> file in
    your web server's cgi-bin directory, and then edit the first few
    lines of it to tell it the name of your blog and where the entries
    will live, and you're done.</p>

    <p>
       Posting into the blog is just a matter of creating a file
      called <code>something.txt</code> in the blog directory. It
      doesn't even matter what the <code>something</code> is. All that
      matters is the first line of the file, which becomes the title,
      and the rest, which becomes the story in raw HTML:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
First post!

&lt;p&gt; Today I set up a blosxom blog. It was really easy! &lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      You can then, if you like, <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/documentation/users/flavour.html">style
      your blog</a> with custom header and footer files, CSS, custom
      HTML for each blog post, and so on.
    </p>

<h3><a name="Enter_Bryar" id="Enter_Bryar">Enter Bryar</a></h3>

    <p>
      Of course, back when I started using Blosxom, things were not
      quite so easy, and templating required hacking the Blosxom CGI
      file itself, and things just didn't seem as neat as I wanted
      them to be. I liked Blosxom's simplicity, but didn't want to pay
      the price for it in terms of flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I was learning the wonders of the <a href="/pub/a/2001/01/tt2.html">Template
      Toolkit</a>, and thought that a well-designed blog should merely
      collect Post objects and send them to a user-defined template to
      do what it wants with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I started writing Bryar, which is designed to be a modular,
      extensible replacement for Blosxom. To make this happen, I
      needed to provide a default set of components that simply Does
      The Right Thing. Let's take a look at that default set before we
      go any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we install Bryar from CPAN, we're encouraged to run a
      command to set up a new blog:
    </p>
<pre>
<code>You probably want to run bryar-newblog in a likely home for
your blog once we've finished installing.</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>bryar-newblog</code> command simply sets up a decent
      default set of templates, creates a first blog post, and drops
      in a <code>bryar.cgi</code> driver, similar to
      <code>blosxom</code>. At this point, we're ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryar's default collection of modules consists of a
      <code>Bryar::DataSource::FlatFile</code>, which emulates
      Blosxom's use of text files in the file system as a database of
      blog posts; there are <code>Bryar::Frontend::CGI</code> and
      <code>Bryar::Frontend::mod_perl</code>, which describe how URL
      parameters are retrieved from the server translated into a
      request for documents, <code>Bryar::Document</code> which
      represents each post, and <code>Bryar::Collector</code> which
      ties it all together. With the benefit of hindsight, that should
      have been called a <code>Bryar::Controller</code>, since the
      whole thing can be described as a Model-View-Controller
      application. But more on that later!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since all of these things can be overridden, we need something to
      keep track of which classes we're using, and the
      <code>Bryar::Config</code> class does that, reading an optional
      configuration file but otherwise providing mostly sensible
      defaults.
    </p>
    <p>
In the rest of this article we're going to look at some interesting ways to override those classes, and build some
      more funky tools out of this social software framework.
    </p>

<h3><a name="Blogging_the_Past" id="Blogging_the_Past">Blogging the Past</a></h3>

    <p>
      Now it may surprise some people to find that I'm not really a
      programmer, although it may not come as a surprise to some of my
      colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was trained in modern and classical Japanese language and
      literature, with a side order of linguistics. Programming was a
      hobby that turned out to make a bit more cash than conjugating
      10th century verbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as I began thinking a bit about blogging, I found an old
      Japanese diary of a lady-in-waiting to the Emperor, called the
      "Pillow Book", by Sei Shonagon. It was something I'd read before
      and found quite interesting, but picking it up again in a blog
      context put it in a completely new light. It read just like a
      10th century LiveJournal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a sample entry:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
Small children and babies should be fat. Provincial governors should
be fat too, and other people who have done well for themselves. If
they're too thin, it makes you think they're miserable.
</p>
</blockquote>
    <p>As well as thoughts, observations, tales of life at the court, the
    book contains a large number of random lists, which really made me
    think of LiveJournal polls and surveys. Here's another
      example:</p>
    <blockquote>
<b>Things I think are elegant</b>

<ul>
        <li>A white coat over a violet waistcoat </li>
        <li>Duck's eggs </li>
        <li>Sherbet ice, liana syrup, in a nice new silver bowl </li>
        <li>Rock crystal </li>
        <li>Wisteria </li>
        <li>Snow on plum blossoms </li>
        <li>A pretty little girl eating strawberries </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      I decided that it would be quite fun to translate the blog
      -- uh, book -- in a fairly modern, relaxed style, use fictitious
      but plausible dates for the entries, and run it as a real blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, I wanted to do this with Bryar, but there was going
      to be a slight problem; Bryar takes its entry dates from the
      Unix timestamp of the file, and try as I might, I could not
      persuade Unix to recognize epoch times a thousand years before
      the epoch. I had to find another way of getting the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since Bryar is extensible, this is really easy -- I just
      write a new data source class that gets the entry timestamp
      from somewhere else. I simply created a subclass of
      <code>Bryar::DataSource::FlatFile</code> called
      <code>...FlatFile::Dated</code>, which takes its date from the
      first line, and title from the next line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling the Bryar blog to use the new data source was simply a
      matter of writing a little config file called <code>bryar.conf</code>:
    </p>
<pre><code>
source: Bryar::DataSource::FlatFile::Dated
name: Notes on a Pillow - Sei Shonagon's blog
baseurl: http://blog.simon-cozens.org/shonagon/bryar.cgi
</code></pre>
    <p>
      And the rest, of course, is just a simple matter of classical
      Japanese translation.
    </p>
<h3><a name="Blogging_the_House" id="Blogging_the_House">Blogging the House</a></h3>
    <p>
      But as well as a linguist, I'm also a geek, and I use Perl to
      control various things around the house -- the house network, the
      division of the phone bill, and so on. This is all driven by
      Template Toolkit and <a href="/pub/a/2002/11/27/classdbi.html"><code>Class::DBI</code></a>. </p>
    <p>
      It seemed useful, at the
      time, to add a blog into this great mass of centralized control,
      so we could pass phone messages around. Of course, in the end,
      it was easier to just put a big whiteboard in the lounge. XP's
      "the simplest thing that could possibly work" wins again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was fun, and it allowed me to use Bryar in a new
      way. This time, we're using the original data source, collector,
      and other modules, but we're plugging them into an existing
      templating system. We already have code to deal with the web
      server, handle the URL processing, and the output; we already
      have code to transform objects into HTML; all we need is to
      collect the recent documents and hand them on to the templates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did this by adding a Bryar object to our template variables,
      and calling the <code>collect_current</code> method on the Bryar
      collector, using Richard Clamp's
      <code>Template::Plugin::Class</code> module. This gave a bunch
      of <code>Bryar::Documents</code>, which the template system could
      manipulate however it desired:
    </p>

<pre><code>[% INCLUDE header %]
[% PROCESS blogmacros %]

&lt;h2&gt; Recent blog postings&lt;/h2&gt;

[%
USE c = Class("Bryar::Collector");
FOR post = c.collect_current(blog);
    display_post(post);
END;
%]</code></pre>













<h3><a name="Everything's_a_wiki" id="Everything's_a_wiki">Everything's a Wiki</a></h3>
    <p>
      So much for blogs, for the time being. The other movement in
      social software at the moment is Ward Cunningham's wiki. A wiki
      has three important characteristics: a simple mark-up language,
      the ability for the viewer to modify the page, and the ability
      to create links from one wiki page to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite initial predictions that they'd be unusable due to
      widespread graffiti, vandalism, and other kinds of kicking down
      the sandcastle, wikis have turned out to work quite well in
      practice, with sites like <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a> collecting a
      great store of information from contributors both regular and
      occasional.
    </p>
    <p>
      CPAN has a fair collection of wiki implementations, including
      Kwiki, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CGI::Wiki"><code>CGI::Wiki</code></a>,
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::MiniWiki"><code>Apache::MiniWiki</code></a>,
      and others. However, there may well be times when it makes sense
      to create a new implementation, particularly when the wiki is to
      be embedded in another application.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it mean to embed a wiki? An example will demonstrate
      it best. Imagine a web-mail system like IMP or SquirrelMail. Now
      we want to add the ability to write a short note or annotation
      on a given message, so that it can be referred back to later. If
      I get a mail from my friend Al arranging to meet up for a drink
      at the pub, I'd want to annotate the mail with Al's mobile phone
      number, directions to the pub, and the fact that I need to take
      the book that I borrowed from him last month. Then, in an ideal
      world, the mail system would collect all the notes, work out the
      date and time of the meeting, and tell my calendaring software
      about it, but that's another story for a different time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that once we have these sticky notes for mail, we
      might want to use them to refer to other mail, group them
      together in fluid topics, and so on. For instance, if I
      mentioned in the annotation that this was an
      <code>AlMeeting</code>, I would expect that text to be magically
      marked up as a link to all the other <code>AlMeeting</code>
      mails. Here we've got the three elements of a wiki -- annotation
      editing, a simple markup language, and the ability to link.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the editing is a simple matter of linking your CGI
      parameters with your database, something that should be second
      nature to those who want to <a href="/pub/a/2003/07/15/nocode.html">avoid
      writing code</a>, the other two components take a little bit of
      work. Thankfully, chromatic has written a handy module, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~chromatic/Text-WikiFormat-0.71/lib/Text/WikiFormat.pm"><code>Text::WikiFormat</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <code>WikiFormat</code>, you can pass a text string marked
      up in wiki format to <code>Text::WikiFormat::format</code>, and
      it will return you HTML:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
print Text::WikiFormat::format(&lt;&lt;EOF);
= A Test Post =

I found this '''very''' interesting WikiLink recently.

EOF

__DATA__
&lt;h1&gt;A Test Post&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I found this &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; interesting 
&lt;a href=&quot;WikiLink&quot;&gt;WikiLink&lt;/a&gt; recently. &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>
      This gives us the simple markup, but it doesn't do much about
      the linkability; for an embedded wiki, we're going to need finer-grained control over how the links are constructed. For
      instance, we might want to pass the link name to a particular
      URL with a particular CGI parameter. Thankfully,
      <code>Text::WikiFormat</code> supports two optional parameters
      in addition to the text to be formatted: the first is a hash
      reference overriding how the wiki text is marked up to HTML, and
      the second is a hash reference of options, such as the URL
      prefix for links.
    </p> 
    <p>
      So, if we have an application that displays 
      a page given a parameter in the URL, we can just say: 
    </p> 
    <pre><code> 
Text::WikiFormat::format($text, {},  
        { prefix => "http://www.myhost.int/wiki?page=" }); 
</code></pre> 
    <p> 
      And there we have it, an instant wiki. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
      Of course, in the context of our webmail application, we may 
      have to do something more convoluted. For instance, we might 
      want a link to <code>SimonCozens</code> to resolve to all mail 
      from that person, if it can be understood as a person who sends 
      email, or to a similarly marked-up set of messages, like an 
      <code>AlMeeting</code>, if it can't. For this, we need  to
      introduce a bit of logic and decide how to form the link.  
    </p> 
    <p> 
      As we mentioned above, <code>Text::WikiFormat</code> allows us 
      to specify replacements for the way markup is translated to 
      HTML. <code>WikiFormat</code> uses a hash-ref internally to turn 
      wiki "tags" into HTML, and we can, in fact, put in a subroutine 
      reference for the <code>link</code> tag and have that emit the 
      appropriate HTML link. 
    </p> 
    <pre><code> 
sub markup { 
    my $text = shift; 
    Text::WikiFormat::format(shift, { link => \&amp;my_link });
} 

sub my_link {
    my $linkname = shift;
    my $name = $linkname;
    ($name=$linkname) =~ s/(?&lt;=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])/ /g;
    if (have_mail_from($name)) {
       # Valid correspondent, link to page of their mail
       my $id = correspondent_id($name);
       return qq{&lt;A HREF="/mail/search?correspondent=$id"&gt;}.$name.
              "&lt;/A&gt;";
    }
    # Not a correspondent, just a wiki page
    return qq{&lt;A HREF="/wiki?$linkname"&gt;}.$linkname.
           "&lt;/A&gt;";
}
</code></pre> 
    <p>
      What's going on here? First, we receive the link name in
      StudlyCaps every time <code>format</code> sees a link. We then
      convert it to a real name, by inserting a space in the gaps
      between a lowercase character and an uppercase one. Now we have
      a name like "Simon Cozens" that we can search our mailstore for,
      and if we find someone, we can return the URL to a page about
      their mail. Otherwise, we return a wiki page. We've used our
      webmail annotations to refer to either real people or to other 
      annotations, stealthily embedding a wiki in the application, with 
      minimal effort.

    <h3><a name="Creating_the_Bliki" id="Creating_the_Bliki"
>Creating the Bliki</a></h3>
    <p> 
      With that example of how to create a custom wiki from an 
      existing application, let's return to Bryar and our blogging 
      software. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of a bliki -- a cross between a wiki and a blog -- may
      seem like a bizarre one at first, but it's such a natural
      synergy that it's been independently invented by multiple
      people, including <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html">Martin Fowler</a> and <a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20020906">many others</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on how you look at it, a bliki is either an ordinary
      wiki with a blog-style front-end showing the latest posts, or an
      ordinary blog with wiki-like markup and interconnections between
      the posts. The only difference between these views is how easy
      it is to edit the posts. We'll stick with the "ordinary blog"
      viewpoint, since editing posts over the Web is a boring and
      solved problem, and one not really related to the technology
      we're looking at today.
    </p>
    <p>
      How are we going to extend Bryar to become a bliki? It's obvious
      that <code>Text::WikiFormat</code> is going to be involved
      somewhere, and it would be helpful to use the
      <code>Bryar::DataSource::FlatFile</code> class too. First, we
      inherit from the <code>FlatFile</code> class, and override the
      <code>make_document</code> method, which is responsible for
      turning a filename into a <code>Bryar::Document</code>:
    </p>
<pre><code>
package Bryar::DataSource::FlatFile::Bliki;
use base 'Bryar::DataSource::FlatFile';
use strict;
use Text::WikiFormat;

sub make_document {
    my ($self, $filename) = @_;
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here the format will be slightly different -- the filename (such
      as "<code>MyWikiPost.txt</code>") will be used to form both the
      title and the ID of the document, and the content of the
      document will be transformed via <code>WikiFormatter</code>
      wholesale.
    </p>
<pre><code>
sub make_document {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;
    return unless $file and open my $in, $file;
    my $when = (stat $file)[9];
    my $who = getpwuid((stat $file)[4]);
    $file =~ s/\.txt$//;

    my $dir = dirname($file);
    $dir =~ s{^\./?}{};
    my $category = $dir || "main";

    local $/;
    my $text = &lt;$in&gt;;
    
    return Bryar::Document->new(
        title    => $file,
        content  => Text::WikiFormat::format($text, {}, {prefix => "id_"}),
        epoch    => $when,
        author   => $who,
        id       => $file,
        category => $category,
    );
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      We change the prefix for links to be a relative link of the form
      <code>id_PostName</code>, since this is how Bryar deals with
      references to other blog posts, by default. (Of course, we could
      change this by modifying the FrontEnd class, but this seems to
      work fine.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It took 30 lines of code to convert Bryar into a simple
      bliki, many of which were stolen from the superclass. Now let's look
      at something a bit different.
    </p>
    <h3>Everything's a Blog</h3>
    <p>
      I mentioned when introducing Bryar that it was based on the
      Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, although I didn't realize this
      while designing it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The MVC pattern is described in <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ModelViewController">this
      entry</a> in Ward Cunningham's own wiki, as being made up of
      three parts:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<ul>
        <li> A <strong>model</strong>, therefore is an object representing data 
            or even activity, e.g. a database table or even some plant-floor 
            production-machine process. </li>
        <li> A <strong>view</strong> is some form of visualization of the 
            state of the model. </li>
        <li> A <strong>controller</strong> offers facilities to change the 
            state of the model. </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
    <p>
      All kinds of things follow the MVC design. In Bryar, the model
      is the data source object; the view is the templating object;
      the controller is the Collector object. A web browser might be
      described as a controller that contains all its logic, a view
      which contains the user interface, and the pane of rendered HTML,
      and the model of the entire Worldwide Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some web-based applications follow Bryar's MVC approach
      particularly closely. Imagine, for instance, a company's product
      catalog on the Web. The catalog data will be stored in some
      kind of database, and will be presented via a templating system,
      with a controller that will decide which products to
      show. Isn't that exactly the same as reading some blog posts
      from a database (albeit potentially one that looks a lot like a
      filesystem), rendering them via templating system, with a
      controller deciding which posts to show?
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, many of the views you will want of the catalog data
      are exactly what you'd want from a blog: display the most
      recent products, display all products, search by product name
      or description, and a detailed display of a single product.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've seen it take 30 lines to turn a blog into a bliki. To
      turn a blog into a complete product catalog web site takes a
      subclass of the <code>Bryar::DataSource::DBI</code> class (to
      talk to the product database) and the
      <code>Bryar::Document</code> class (to take more details, a URL
      to a photo, and so on). The rest is a matter of templating, and
      that's a designer's job!
    </p>
    <h3>Social Software</h3>
    <p>
      I consider the emergence of interest in social software to be
      one of the most fascinating trends in software engineering this
      year. Two of the most powerful and popular aspects of this,
      wikis and blogs, are particularly well-suited for extension and
      embedding, and Perl is a particularly well-suited language for
      achieving this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although part of the point of this article was to demonstrate
      Bryar, there were several other important points. First, that
      there are plenty of Perl implementations of both wikis and blogs
      that you can choose from; second, that Perl makes it really easy
      to create your own blog or wiki and customize to your own
      purposes, including embedding them in an existing application.
    </p>
    <p>
      But finally, the point was to encourage you to think about good
      design and the power of extensible applications; if you can
      create a tool that is both powerful and generalizable -- just
      like Perl itself -- it may end up doing wildly different things
      to what you initially intended!
    </p>
