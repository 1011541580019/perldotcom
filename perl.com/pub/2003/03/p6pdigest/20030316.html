We'll startwith perl6-internals as usual, before bracing ourselves for theincreased volume and ploughing on into perl6-language.</p><h4><a name="object_spec">Object Spec</a></h4><p>Dan's 3rd try at the Objects and Classes spec received a very smallamount of further discussion this week. What there was mostly touchedon the boundary between where the line is drawn between parrot'sobject system and a particular language's object system. Theinference I draw from all this is that the next Object spec will bethe <code>final(ish)</code> Parrot Object spec.</p><h4><a name="parrot_0.0.10">Parrot 0.0.10</a></h4><p>Steve Fink instituted a Parrot feature freeze in the run up to 0.0.10at the end of last week, aiming for a release on Saturday the 15th ofMarch and noted that he was leaning toward &quot;Juice&quot; as a code name(punning on Leo T&ouml;tsch's work on the <code>imcc -Oj</code>optimizations). David Cuny pointed out that there was already avirtual machine called Juice and suggested a whole list of possiblecode names. Leo T&ouml;tsch reckoned that calling it 'Juice' would be'too much honour' and suggested a list of anagrams of 'Parrotten'. (&quot;Partner to&quot;, &quot;Par Rotten&quot; or &quot;Tarte porn&quot; anyone?).</p><p>It looks like we missed the release on the 15th, but Steve announceda release candidate on the 16th, in expectation of a release on the17th.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030309225740.GA662%40foxglove">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- Feature freeze</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030316091856.GB662%40foxglove">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- Release candidate announced</p><h4><a name="languages/basic_reorg"><em>languages/BASIC</em> reorg</a></h4><p>Clinton A Pierce announced that he'd reorganized the<em>languages/BASIC</em> subtree into 'compiled' and 'interpreted'subtrees and noted that he was very impressed with the improvements inParrot's speed and memory management. Leo T&ouml;tsch pointed out afew issues with MANIFEST and the need for a Makefile, and wondered ifClinton had run things through IMCC.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=5.1.0.14.2.20030309181336.03b10b10%40mail.geeksalad.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="the_judy_algorithm">The Judy algorithm</a></h4><p>Tim Bunce pointed everyone at the Judy dynamic array code onSourceforge and wondered if it would be useful for Parrot. (Judy is ahigh speed dynamic array implementation optimized for modernprocessor architectures apparently). Leo T&ouml;tsch thought itlooked interesting and suggested that someone try wrapping Judy up ina PMC and running some performance tests. Elizabeth Mattijsen went andtook a look and reported some issues with memory leakage and worriedthat the project looked 'silent'. Tim mailed her concerns toJudy's author who addressed them in his reply and admitted that hewasn't that good at keeping the website up to date. He said that Judyhad been 'tested carefully not to have leakage' and wondered if itmight have been an issue with the tool Liz used to do the testing.</p><p>I await further developments with interest. If Judy can be made towork, it looks jolly quick.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030310103730.GG25543%40dansat.data-plan.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://judy.sourceforge.net/application/10minutes.htm">http://judy.sourceforge.net/application/10minutes.htm</a></p><h4><a name="yet_another_iterator_proposal">Yet another iterator proposal</a></h4><p>Leo T&ouml;tsch posted a request for comments on what he called 'yetanother iterator proposal'. Nobody commented. I wonder if this meanseveryone liked it.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E6CAC8F.4010308%40toetsch.at">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="parrot_for_windows">Parrot for Windows</a></h4><p>Benjamin Goldberg wondered if there were any precompiled parrotbinaries for Win32 available as he wants to be able to test parrotcode without the current weird rites he has to go through (see hispost for details). Clinton A Pierce put a snapshot build up on his sitetemporarily for Benjamin to download. Robert Spier offered space onwww.parrotcode.org for a windows build when the next release comes outwhich Dan thought would be really cool. Dan also wondered about makingan automated build farm but I think he may have a tuit shortage whenit comes time to actually implement it. Joshua Hoblitt also offered tohost binaries on his CPAN mirror. Clint said he'd be happy to makemilestone binaries and wondered if there was a standard way such adistribution should be put together.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E6D7C66.3327A18F%40earthlink.net">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="moving_to_pio">Moving to PIO</a></h4><p>J&uuml;rgen B&ouml;mmels continued to make Dan happy by moving morefile related opcodes from STDIO to Parrot's PIO libraries. The latestops to get his attention were <code>open</code> and <code>close</code>. Dan did a happydance and applied the patch before wondering if we were subject to acode freeze (I don't think so; it was feature freeze time).</p><p><a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html?id=21536">http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html</a></p><h4><a name="imcc_and_pdd03_(calling_conventions)">IMCC and PDD03 (Calling conventions)</a></h4><p>Leo has been thinking some more about the parrot calling conventionsdescribed in Parrot Design Document 3 and worried that they can'tactually be done. He proposed reducing the number of parameters thatcan be passed in registers in order to take pressure off the registerallocator in IMCC. Dan agreed and quickly changed the PDD to take thisinto account. Leo then asked for some clarification on a couple ofother issues that he was having a hard time understanding. Dan saidthat it was probably best to come back to these issues after he'd donePDD15 (The object spec). Leo agreed that objects will probably shedmore light on the calling conventions and we all sat back to hang onDan's every object oriented word. Not that there's any pressure atall.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E6F6860.4030103%40toetsch.at">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="parrot_extensions,_or_pmc_versatility">Parrot extensions, or PMC versatility</a></h4><p>Darren Duncan had some questions about PMCs and parrot extensions andwhat he should consider as he wrote a general persistence library. Danand Benjamin Goldberg had some answers.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=p05111b00ba970ad339b0%40%5B24.70.202.54%5D">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="sun4_vtable_jit_support">sun4 vtable JIT support</a></h4><p>Jason Gloudon posted a patch adding support for vtable calls in thesun4/JIT and added support for some more ops. There appeared to be afew problems with the patch so it hasn't been applied yet.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-21577-53666.4.91616196911266%40bugs6.perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="a_fish,_a_barrel_and_a_running_joke">A fish, a barrel and a running joke</a></h4><p>Leon Brocard made maintaining this particular running joke almosttrivial this week by actually posting something. He's implemented<code>uniq(1)</code> in parrot assembly, though he notes that it's not very fastcompared to GNU <code>uniq(1)</code> yet. Dan added it to the distribution in<em>examples/assembly/</em>.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-21588-53714.14.8561040030741%40bugs6.perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="parrot_reaches_another_milestone">Parrot reaches another milestone</a></h4><p>Dan has decided that Parrot has reached the point where it should havea working <code>install</code> make target. He asked for someone to make itso. No takers so far, but he posted late on Sunday so maybe there willbe news of this in the next summary.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a0521060bba9a52cb54c4%40%5B63.120.19.221%5D">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h3><a name="meanwhile,_over_in_perl6language">Meanwhile, over in perl6-language</a></h3><p>perl6-language saw 210 messages this week. Which I think is more thanit's seen in the last 3 or 4 weeks put together. Maybe it hadsomething to do with the return of Damian Conway and the release ofApocalypse 6 (and the spectacularly short Apocalypse 7).</p><h4><a name="statement_modifiers">Statement modifiers</a></h4><p>Matthijs van Duin wondered if the issue of multiple statementmodifiers has been settled. The thread is long, and the answer isessentially (and authoritatively) &quot;Yes, it's settled. No, you can't doit.&quot; So, unless Larry changes his mind the point is moot. However,Matthijs does put his case very well, if you're interested in thisarea I can recommend reading the thread.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030310095221.GC18286%40cds.nl">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language%40perl.org/msg09331.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language%40perl.org/msg09331.html</a></p><h4><a name="just_when_you_get_fed_up_of_waiting_for_the_apocalypse...">Just when you get fed up of waiting for the Apocalypse...</a></h4><p>Two come along at once.</p><p>Apocalypses 6 and 7 appeared online on Monday, a mere 9 months sincethe last one (Apocalypse 7 is all of two sentences long and iscontained within Apocalypse 6, we'll be ignoring it from now on). ThisApocalypse covered closures, subs, functions, methods, types,signatures and pile of other good stuff. All the syntax introduced wasspelled out neatly using Perl 6 rule notation, neatly showing off thepower of the syntax introduced in Apocalypse 5. I would attempt tosummarize it, but it's already pretty dense so I suggest you all readit:</p><p><a href="/pub/a/2003/03/07/apocalypse6.html">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/03/07/apocalypse6.html</a></p><p>Now you've digested that, the rest of the summary should be easier tofollow.</p><p>Damian returned to the list, though he's only reading posts related toApocalypse 6 and he's pretty busy writing Exegesis 6 too so we're notexpecting vast amounts of posts from him.</p><p>Austin Hastings kicked off with the first question, wondering if the's' in <code>&lt;psiglet&gt;</code> was silent. &quot;Of course not.&quot; says Larry.</p><p>Paul applauded the new <code>macro</code> feature (but Damian corrected hissyntax).</p><h4><a name="s&m_vs._b&d">S&amp;M vs. B&amp;D</a></h4><p>Uri Guttman, displayed entirely too much knowledge about thedifference between B&amp;D and S&amp;M asking if Larry shouldn't have used B&amp;Dwhere he used S&amp;M in the apocalypse. Austin Hastings knows too muchtoo it appears, commenting that it depends on whether you considerstrongly typed compile-type semantics as being restrictive orpainful.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=x7el5eoq8c.fsf%40mail.sysarch.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="can_is_properties_be_specified_indirectly">Can &quot;is&quot; properties be specified indirectly?</a></h4><p>Austin Hastings wondered if there would be some way of differentiatingbetween an array of constants and an array of variables. In otherwords, how would one specify an array which may be appended/pushed,but whose values cannot change or a hash to which you could add keysbut not change existing entries. Damian thought that you'd have tosubclass Array or Hash as appropriate. Luke Palmer wasn't keen on thisbecause then it would be easier to do something in C++ than in Perl,which isn't the usual way of things.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030310221737.97547.qmail%40web12307.mail.yahoo.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="is_constant_eq_pass_by_value"><code>is constant</code> eq pass by value?</a></h4><p>Uri Guttman was confused by the default parameter passing style forPerl 6 functions, <code>is constant</code>. A parameter variable declared with<code>is constant</code> is 'locked'; you can't use the same variable to hold adifferent value.</p><pre><code>   sub some_func ($some_arg is constant) {       $some_arg += 10;       ...       return $some_arg;   }</code></pre><p>To do that you need to declare the parameter with <code>is copy</code>. Urinoted that he really should keep his finger off the send button untilhe's read the whole 'megilla', whatever one of those is.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=x74r6aomdr.fsf%40mail.sysarch.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="pipes">Pipes</a></h4><p>Michael Lazzaro declared that he thought the Apocalypse was <em>great</em>and that the 'sig stuff is very, very nice.' Then he asked about'pipes' (the new <code>&lt;==</code> and <code>==&gt;</code> operators which are almost,but not quite, entirely unlike the hypothetical <code>~&gt;</code> and<code>&lt;~</code> operators that were discussed so interminably a fewsummaries back). He wanted to know what was decided about some of theedge cases discussed in the appendix to the apocalypse (and had acomment to make about style). Damian pointed out that Michael's edgecases all collapsed to two:</p><pre><code>    @var &lt;== LIST;    LIST ==&gt; @var;</code></pre><p>Damian said that Larry was still unsure about these but that he(Damian) thought they would be allowed in, if only because</p><pre><code>    @in ==&gt; map  {...}        ==&gt; sort {...}        ==&gt; map  {...}        ==&gt; @out;</code></pre><p>is a lot less ugly than</p><pre><code>    @in ==&gt; map  {...}        ==&gt; sort {...}        ==&gt; map  {...}        ==&gt; push @out;</code></pre><p>or (John Williams suggestion)</p><pre><code>    LIST ==&gt; @var.STORE(*);</code></pre><p>I have visions of the Perl 6 naysayers reading this section andmuttering dark imprecations about the end of the Perl as we knowit...</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=BC6DD3EA-535B-11D7-8B38-00050245244A%40cognitivity.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="complex_parameter_types">Complex Parameter Types</a></h4><p>Michael Lazzaro wanted to know more about 'complex' typedeclarations. He wanted to know how these interacted with signatures,could one use arbitrarily complex types in subroutine signatures? Couldone do multidispatch on them? He also had a question aboutwhen/whether types got coerced (that wasn't actually his question, butit's what it boiled down to) when functions were called.</p><p>The answer to the first two questions was straightforward: Yes, youcan use arbitrarily complex types in function and multimethodsignatures.</p><p>The third one proved a little trickier. Damian said that values wouldnot be coerced, but Larry wasn't so sure. He thought that coercionwould be the right thing to do. Probably. Damian noted that the 'RightThing' could well vary depending on whether the parameter in questionwas declared <code>is constant/rw</code> (in which case passing a parameter withthe wrong type would be an error) or <code>is copy</code> (in which casecoercion could be the thing to do). Austin Hastings wondered if thiscould be handled with a <code>use strict 'params'</code> type pragma, but Damianwasn't convinced, arguing that the use of typed params automaticallyimplied type stricture.</p><p>This thread gets horribly hard to summarize so, for now, I'll justpick out some representative highlights.</p><p>Larry says that, in the absence of a pragma to the contrary typechecking will be done at runtime if the type is unknown/unknowable atcompile time, but he expects the B&amp;D types to come up with a pragmathat enforces compile time checking on pain of failed compilations.</p><p>Brent Dax came up with the concept of 'strict' and 'loose' argumenttyping. Strict arg typing doesn't coerce except that, say, a Child cansatisfy a requirement for a Parent. Loose arg typing will coercewherever possible. He argued that the mechanism for choosing betweenstrict and loose arg typing should be under the control of the<em>caller</em> rather than the callee, as that seemed to fit best with ThePerl Way. Larry agreed with him. He added that the real question iswhether the default <code>use strict</code> should include strict arg typing andnoted that he was inclining toward the strict side. This week.</p><p>A subthread sprang up dealing with Type inference. David Whipp notedthat a smart compiler might well be able to infer the type of somevariables at compile time. The theory being that in the presence ofgood type inference some variables wouldn't have to have a known typeto avoid triggering compile time errors under strict arg typing. AngelFaus pointed out that using 'user visible' type inference wasn't toogood an idea because (among other reasons) it might lead to caseswhere a program only works as written for more recent versions of thecompiler (which doesn't mean that type inference is a bad idea; if thecompiler knows the type of a variable it could potentially use thatinformation to improve code performance).</p><p>My head started spinning when Larry seemed to imply that, not only isInt a Scalar, but a Scalar is also an Int. Or maybe it plays one onTV.</p><p>This thread is still very much underway as I write this summary, soattempting to summarize it is akin to summarizing a book when you'rehalfway through it; you're never quite sure what are the importantbits. Hopefully things will be a little nearer resolution next weekand you'll get a more coherent summary of the conclusions.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=47347794-5363-11D7-8B38-00050245244A%40cognitivity.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030314033648.58654.qmail%40onion.perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- the inferencesubthread</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030313195506.GA15015%40wall.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- My head hurts</p><h4><a name="signatures_zones_and_line_noise">Signatures zones and line noise</a></h4><p>Brent Dax wasn't keen on the new syntax for declaring whetherparameters were optional, positional, named or variadic (greedy) andwondered if we couldn't use something prettier (wordier) with namedtraits (<code>$x is optional</code> etc). Damian thought that would be'uncomfortably prolix' with default values ending up a long way fromtheir owners. Paul and Brent proposed allowing</p><pre><code>    multi substr(Str $str, $from = $CALLER::_ is optional                           $len  = Inf is optional,                           $new is optional) {        ...    }</code></pre><p>but Damian pointed out that this could lead to badness because, in asignature the <code>is</code> would bind to the variable, but in a normalvariable declaration and assignment the <code>is</code> would bind to the value,which would be confusing. There was some discussion of appropriatenames for the other 'linenoise' in signatures, specifically the choiceof name for the <code>*</code> type. The three front runners appear to be'variadic', 'greedy' and 'slurpy/slurpificatious'. I like 'greedy',but then I'm close to the person who proposed it.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=005401c2e798%2449301b90%246501a8c0%40deepblue">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="in_which_luke_palmer_gets_ignored">In which Luke Palmer gets ignored</a></h4><p>Luke Palmer had things to say about Appendix C of the apocalypse,specifically to do with temp/let and with <code>caller</code> andContinuations. Maybe what he said on these subjects was completelyuncontroversial, but nobody has replied to either ofthem yet.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=ygc1y1eictl.fsf%40babylonia.flatirons.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- temp/let</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=ygcsmtu5h0l.fsf%40babylonia.flatirons.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- Continuations</p><h4><a name="multi_promotion">Multi promotion</a></h4><p>Richard Proctor wondered what would happen if you declared amultimethod with the same name as a previously declared normalsub/method. Specifically he wanted to know if the new declarationwould automagically turn the old one into a multimethod. MichaelLazzaro thought not. As did Damian and Larry. Damian provided asummary of the rules for subroutine/method dispatch, which lookwonderfully subvertable. Piers Cawley wondered if it would be possibleto get at a 'dispatcher' object and/or override it in a lexical scope,nothing that sometimes, he scares himself. Nicholas Clark seemed tothink Piers wasn't completely insane before going on to talk aboutwrapping and unwrapping in the case when the wrapper has itself beenwrapped. Larry seemed to think that unwrapping should still do theright thing even if the wrapper being removed is itself wrapped.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=Marcel-1.53-0311144218-0b0Rr9i%40waveney.demon.co.uk">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E6E853D.9090604%40conway.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- Dispatch rules (OK?)</p><h4><a name="wrappers_vs._efficiency">Wrappers vs. Efficiency</a></h4><p>In the Apocalypse, Larry talked about the performance implications ofgeneralized function wrappers and brought up the idea of subroutinetraits which would mark a sub as unwrappable, giving <code>is inline</code> asan example. John Siracusa asked that whatever the 'specific definitionfor speed' is that forbids runtime wrapping, it shouldn't be spelled'inline' (though inline may imply &quot;don't wrap me please&quot;). A fewpeople agreed, but things mostly got left vague.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=BA93ED19.605E6%25siracusa%40mindspring.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="macro_invocants">Macro invocants</a></h4><p>Dave Whipp wondered about using macros to do things like:</p><pre><code>    my Database $db = MySqlDatabase.connect(...);    $db.select * FROM Foo WHERE Foo.bar LIKE a%b;</code></pre><p>by implementing <code>select</code> as a macro. Larry thought so, but you wouldhave to export the macro into the calling context. Larry added thatyou would probably implement that particular functionality by treating&quot;.select&quot; as an infix macro with a specially parsed argument on itsright hand side (the SQL statement). David thought this was a littleclunky and proposed <code>macromethod</code> as a way to avoid the exportrequirements. Luke Palmer was unconvinced and it went back and forth afew times.</p><p>Larry wasn't convinced by David's suggestion either, commenting that'mixing such compile-time semantics with a notation that supposedlymandates run-time dispatch is a recipe for a certain amount ofconfusion no matter how well we do it.'</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030312013549.15320.qmail%40onion.perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="overloading_multis_on_constness_of_parameters">Overloading multis on constness of parameters</a></h4><p>Joe Gottman wondered if it would be possible to overload multimethodsbased on the const-ness of a parameter is the same way C++ does. Theanswer appears to be 'yes'. Piers Cawley passed on a question fromGreg MacCarroll about overloading on the value of a parameter. Damianthought probably not, but then showed a cunning trick involvingoverloading <code>isa</code> and a junction to allow something pretty similar.Luke Palmer was impressed.</p><p>I'm not entirely sure what it had to do with this particular thread,but Austin Hastings posted a chart of his understanding of the variousdispatch rules. Worth reading.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=004d01c2e83b%2447b8c0c0%24cf6e1918%40carolina.rr.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030314205347.31744.qmail%40web12308.mail.yahoo.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- Austin's chart</p><h4><a name="operators_and_context">Operators and context</a></h4><p>Deborah Ariel Picket had some questions about Michael Lazzaro'scomplete list of known Perl 6 operators, and wondered if this listshould be extended to take context into account. She also wonderedwhat the complete list of possible contexts was now. Michael reckonedthat the list she pointed to was still current, but he expected to addthe new <code>&lt;==</code> and <code>==&gt;</code> ops. He also agreed that addinginformation about contextual behaviour would be a good (if daunting)thing to do. He noted too that Apocalypse 6 seems to imply that therewould be a context for every type. Nothing definitive from Larry (oreven Damian) yet.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=200303130103.h2D13EY1026789%40bruce.csse.monash.edu.au">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg12130.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg12130.html</a>-- the current operators list</p><h4><a name="assignment_overloading">Assignment Overloading</a></h4><p>Luke Palmer wondered if it would be possible to overload theassignment operator and wondered if the assignment operator was avalue or a reference copy. Damian pointed out that <code>*infix:=</code> wasreally an operator on containers not values and you'd probablyimplement it by overloading <code>STORE</code> in the container's class. He alsocommented that <code>STORE</code> might end up being spelled<code>&amp;infix:=</code>. Copying is a shallow value copy.</p><p>Larry popped up to discuss the .copy method on SCALAR but I wasn'tentirely sure whether that gets called on the target container or thething being copied.

Murat &Uuml;nalan suggested that Aldowas posting to the wrong audience before suggesting that we adopt the.Net/Java object hierarchy, which confused Aldo somewhat, so Muratclarified what he meant. Simon Cozens made a few suggestions to Aldoabout naming and missing classes. Larry added some clarifications onhis thinking about the difference between types and classes.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20251014703.20030313105923%40perl.it">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><p><a href="http://dada.perl.it/p6fc.html">http://dada.perl.it/p6fc.html</a> -- Aldo's class diagram</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030314184631.GD22246%40wall.org">http://groups.google.com/groups</a> -- Larry on types and classes</p><h4><a name="thoughts_about_multiple_properties">Thoughts about multiple properties</a></h4><p>Chris Dutton wondered about using junctions for multiple propertiesso <code>method bar is public is rw {...}</code> could be written as<code>method bar is public &amp; rw {...}</code> instead. Jonathan Scott Duffdidn't think that made much sense, and pointed out that the <code>is</code> isoptional after the first, so you could write <code>method bar is public rw {...}</code> if you wanted. Larry noted that 'thatfeature is still in Schr&ouml;dinger's little box.'</p><p>This led Mark Biggar to suggest some syntax for neatly defininggroups of traits and complex types without having to go to the lengthof defining a class. Michael Lazzaro thought that Perl 6 classeswouldn't be as heavyweight as they are in Perl 5 and did some WAGging(Wild Ass Guessing) about making subs that inherit from Sub whichlooked pretty good to me even if it did lead Austin Hastings to callMichael a 'bad, evil man'.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=37E62955-5584-11D7-A62F-0005020F8EB9%40cmb-enterprises.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="named_vs._variadic_parameters">Named vs. Variadic Parameters</a></h4><p>Michael Lazzaro pointed up some issues with subroutines that have bothvariadic arguments and named arguments. Luke Palmer thought that therewere two, mutually exclusive, ways of dealing with this: Michael's proposedbehaviour and the behaviour described in the Apocalypse. Luke washappy with the Apocalypse behaviour. Michael said that he hoped thatwhatever was decided, 'broken' function signatures would give rise toa compiler error.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=59940A64-567C-11D7-895C-00050245244A%40cognitivity.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="is_static"><code>is static</code>?</a></h4><p>Uri Guttman asked about static variables in Perl 6. In Perl 5 you canget a static variable by doing:</p><pre><code>    {        my $count = 0;        sub sequence { return ++$count }    }</code></pre><p>Uri wanted to be able to do something like:</p><pre><code>    sub sequence {        my $count is static is default(0);        return ++$count;    }</code></pre><p>Dave Whipp wondered if <code>our</code> did the job (it doesn't). Larrymentioned that he didn't particularly like 'static' as a name for thissort of variable and reckoned that, if there were an 'is static'declaration the compiler would probably translate:</p><pre><code>    my $pi is static = 3;</code></pre><p>to something like</p><pre><code>    our $foo__Xdeadbeef will init {.set(3)}</code></pre><p>Larry's preferred syntax would be <code>our $foo is unique</code>, but he notedthat 'It's not like someone isn't going to implement &quot;is static&quot; themoment our back is turned anyway'.</p><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=x7of4c7cj0.fsf%40mail.sysarch.com">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h4><a name="no_mandatory_named_arguments">No mandatory named arguments?</a></h4><p>Nicholas Clark wondered if his reading of Apocalypse 6 was correct andthat there is no way to specify mandatory named parameters. Larryagreed that this was so, but that one could finesse things at runtimewith tricks like:</p><pre><code>    sub foo(+$req = die 'You must supply a &quot;req =&gt;&quot; argument') {...}</code></pre><p><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030315231648.GJ277%40Bagpuss.unfortu.net">http://groups.google.com/groups</a></p><h3><a name="acknowledgements,_announcements_and_apologies">Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies</a></h3><p>That about wraps it up for this week.
