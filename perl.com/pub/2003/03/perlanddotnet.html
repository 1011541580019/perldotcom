<p><i>Randy Ray is coauthor of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pwebserperl/">Programming Web Services with Perl</a></i></p>

<p><i>Abstract: One of the most common categories of questions on the
        <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> mailing list is how to get Perl SOAP applications to
        work with .NET services. It's not that Perl and <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> are
        not suited to the job, but rather that there are easy traps to fall
        into. Add to that the fact that .NET has its own distinct philosophy
        toward applications, and the confusion is understandable. This
        article will cover some of the most common traps and considerations
        that trip up Perl developers.</i></p>
		
    <h3>The .NET Attraction</h3>
	
    <p>When Microsoft first announced its .NET initiative and the variety of
      technologies that would be created to support it, it was met with some
      skepticism. Reactions ranged from "they're at it again" to "this could
      potentially be really powerful." Right now, the reality is sitting
      somewhere in between, but it is gradually moving from the realm of "just
      another Microsoft gimmick" to widespread acceptance. Whatever else the
      .NET concept accomplishes, it is already bringing Web services to the
      general desktop arena.</p>
	  
    <p>One of the limiting factors to the larger acceptance of .NET has been
      the limited set of fully supported languages. Microsoft
      promotes its C# language, while also providing .NET-enabled
      development tools and environments for the other languages that its Visual Studio product supports--Java, C++, and Visual Basic. Because .NET
      is based on several published standards, other tools that are not
      generally .NET-centric are still useful, and provide alternatives to the
      Microsoft tools for some languages, primarily Java.</p>
	  
    <p>The main XML concepts to keep in mind when dealing with a .NET service
      are XML Schema and WSDL, the Web Services Definition Language. A .NET
      service automatically generates a WSDL description of itself as a part of
      the tool environment that Microsoft provides. This is a powerful
      feature, and the key to interoperability with other languages. WSDL
      itself defers the definition of complex datatypes to the XML Schema
      application, which describes both document structure and the nature of
      the content itself.</p>
	  
	  <csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/818" template="article_sidebar.view">
	  
    <p>Unfortunately, Perl has been largely overlooked in the tools arena where
      .NET is concerned. Even though the purpose of basing .NET on open
      standards was to enable wider integration with other tools, systems, and
      languages, the only .NET product for Perl currently available is a Visual
      Studio plug-in for Perl that runs on only Microsoft-based platforms. As
      the number of .NET services grows, so will the desire to access these
      services from Perl clients, often on platforms that don't support Visual
      Studio. The key to doing this lies in the fact that .NET services
      natively support SOAP as an interface, through the WSDL descriptions.</p>
	  
    <h3>The Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
	
    <p>The rest of this article offers five hints and help on writing these
      clients in Perl, using the <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> toolkit.</p>
	  
<ol>
<li><p><b>Identify and Qualify</b></p>

    <p>The first, and most common, mistake that Perl clients make is to forget
      that .NET interfaces are strongly typed and use named arguments. Perl
      does neither of these things by default. In fact, when dealing with a
      SOAP service that is written in Perl, most of the time a client
      doesn't have to worry about things such as parameter name or type. A .NET
      service is strict about the names and types (and namespace URIs) of
      the arguments.</p>
	  
    <p>For example, imagine a service that provides the current time, possibly
      adjusted for time zone. The call, <tt>getCurrentTime</tt>, may be called
      with no arguments for the time in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time), or it
      may be passed a single argument, <tt>zone</tt>, the specified  time zone
      for which the time should be adjusted. It expects this argument to be of
      type <tt>string</tt> (using the definition of that basic type from the
      XML Schema specification). But simply passing the argument to a call
      won't get the name right. Instead, <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> will create a
      generic name for the parameter when it creates the actual XML, and .NET
      will reject it.</p>
	  
    <p>To get around this, use the <tt>SOAP::Data</tt> class that is a part of
      <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> (it is in the same module, so you don't have to load
      a second library):</p>
	  
    <pre><code>
 $arg = SOAP::Data->new(name => 'zone', value => 'PST');
    </code></pre>
	
    <p><tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> will properly identify values like "PST" (Pacific
      Standard Time) or "CDT" (Central Daylight Time) as being strings. But
      what if the interface also accepts numerical offsets like "-0800" or
      "+1100"? Without explicit casting as strings, those values would be
      encoded as <tt>int</tt> values. And the service would reject them.</p>
	  
    <p>The <tt>SOAP::Data</tt> class covers this as well:</p>
	
    <pre><code>
 $arg = SOAP::Data->new(name => 'zone', value => 'PST', type => 'xsi:string');
    </code></pre>
	
    <p>(The <i>xsi:</i> prefix on the type refers to the XML Schema Instance
      namespace, which <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> always defines and associates with
      that specific identifier.)</p>
	  
    <p>The <tt>SOAP::Data</tt> class provides methods for all aspects of the
      data item: <tt>name</tt>, <tt>value</tt>, <tt>type</tt>, and so on. It also
      provides <tt>uri</tt> to specify the namespace URI (when needed), and
      <tt>encodingStyle</tt> to specify the URI that identifies an alternative
      encoding from that being used in the rest of the request.</p></li>
	  
<li><p><b>Be Careful About Namespaces</b></p>
	
    <p>The XML namespaces used on elements are just as important in a .NET
      service as the name and type are. SOAP relies on
      namespaces to distinguish parts from each other, but again the relaxed
      nature of Perl can mean that Perl-based services lure you into a false
      sense of ease that .NET doesn't share.</p>
	  
    <p>Unfortunately, <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> makes this harder for .NET
      applications by defaulting to no namespace for elements when none is
      explicitly given. Luckily, the <tt>SOAP::Data</tt> class includes a
      method for defining the namespace as well:</p>
	  
    <pre><code>
 $arg->url('http://use.perl.org/Slash/Journal/SOAP');
    </code></pre>
	
    <p>Explicitly providing the namespace gets even more important when
      encoding complex types such as hashes and arrays.</p></li>
	  
<li><p><b>Use Classes and Objects to Control Encoding</b></p>

    <p>The default methods that <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> uses to encode arrays and
      hash tables will not produce the style of XML that a .NET service is
      expecting. <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> will base things on the plainest, most
      vanilla-type descriptions in the SOAP specification itself, while
      .NET uses complex types as defined in XML Schema for elements that are
      not basic data.</p>
	  
    <p>Suppose a .NET interface defines a complex type it called
      <b>CodeModuleDef</b>. This type has (for now) three simple elements: the
      <i>name</i> of the module, the <i>language</i> it is in, and the
      <i>lines</i> of code. Now imagine the remote method <b>registerModule</b>
      expects one such object as an argument. This <em>won't</em> work:</p>
	  
    <pre><code>
 $soap->registerModule(SOAP::Data->name('module')->uri->('http://...')->
                       value({ name => 'SOAP::Lite', language => 'perl',
                               lines => 4973 }));
    </code></pre>
	
    <p>The receiving server will get an element typed as "SOAPStruct" in the
      default namespace for unknown types (http://xml.apache.org/xml-soap).
      While setting the name and URI were OK, the type will still stop things
      dead in their tracks. Instead, do this:</p>
	  
    <pre><code>
 $soap->registerModule(SOAP::Data->name('module')->uri->('http://...')->
                       value(bless { name => 'SOAP::Lite',
                                     language => 'perl',
                                     lines => 4973 }, 'CodeModuleDef'));
    </code></pre>
	
    <p>The resulting structure will have the correct type attribute set. The
      same approach can be used for array references and scalars that are
      types other than the basic types.</p></li>
	  
<li><p><b>Oops ... Watch Out for Element Order and Namespaces</b></p>

    <p>This actually won't quite bridge the gap all the way. There are two
      problems with it. One is a general Perl feature, the other may be a bug
      with <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt>.</p>
	  
    <p>The first problem is that XML Schema generally requires the elements of
      a complex type to be in a well-defined order (there's one type of
      compound structure that doesn't require this, but it isn't a commonly
      used). Perl, by nature, doesn't preserve a specific order to hash
      keys. You can use the <b>Tie::IxHash</b> module, if you know you will
      always insert the keys in the correct order. Or, you can provide your own
      serialization code for <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> to use. As it happens, this
      will allow you to fix the second problem, too. The second problem stems
      from the fact that <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> assigns the correct namespace to
      the outer element of the structure, but not to the inner elements. In a
      schema-based type, all the elements must be in the same namespace. This
      may be a bug in <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt>, but that hasn't been determined for
      certain (it seems like an unusual feature). The inner elements are in
      fact given no namespace at all.</p>
	  
    <p>What is needed is a function that can be given to the serializer to use
      when it encounters an object of any of the special classes. This routine
      won't have to actually produce XML, <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> will still take
      care of that. This routine will only have to produce a structure that the
      serializer will understand from the object it is given. A filter, in
      other words. To do that, two things are needed: an explicit declaration
      of the field-order, and an understanding of how the serializer expects to
      call this filter, and what it expects to be returned by it.</p>
	  
    <p>The explicit ordering is simple; it can be an array declared in the
      class namespace, or a "private" key on the hash itself. Unlocking the
      second piece took some digging around into the internals of the
      <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> source code. Connecting the two took even more
      digging.</p>
	  
    <p>For the example approach below, assume that any class that will use this
      generic serialization filter defines an array called <tt>@FIELDS</tt> as
      a package-global value. Warning: This approach may be a little hard
      to wrap one's brain around at first. We'll explain it after the code:</p>
	  
    <pre><code>
 sub serialize_complex_type {
   my ($soap, $obj, $name, $type, $attr) = @_;

   my @fields = do { no strict 'refs'; @{ref($obj) . '::FIELDS'} };
   if ($name =~ /^(\w+):(\w+)$/) {
     $name = $2;
     $attr->{xmlns} = $attr->{"xmlns:$1"};
     delete $attr->{"xmlns:$1"};
   } else {
     $attr->{xmlns} = $attr->{uri};
   }

   [ $name, $attr,
   [ map { defined($obj->{$_}) ?
           $soap->encode_object($obj->{$_}, $_) : () }
     @fields ] ];
 }
    </code></pre>
	
    <p>Additionally, every package that plans to use it to serialize their
      objects will have to make it visible to the <tt>SOAP::Serializer</tt>
      package:</p>
	  
    <pre><code>
 *SOAP::Serializer::as_Some__Class = \&amp;main::serialize_complex_type;
    </code></pre>
	
    <p>Here, we assumed a class name of <tt>Some::Class</tt>, and that the
      earlier code was declared in the main namespace. So what does it all
      do?</p>
	  
    <p>The serializing routine is called by an object derived from
      <tt>SOAP::Serializer</tt> (or a subclass of it), as a method with the
      object to serialize, its name, its type, and the hash table of attributes
      as arguments. It expects to get back an array reference with three or four
      values. The first is the tag name to use. The second is the hash
      reference of attributes to add to the opening tag, and the third is
      either an array reference of nested content, or a simple scalar value to
      be put inside the opening and closing tag pair. The fourth element, should
      you include it, is a value for an "ID" attribute. This is used to
      uniquely identify an element, for the sake of multiple references and
      such. We don't worry about it here. </p>
	  
    <p>So we take the arguments as they are given, and the first thing the
      routine does is check for a name that includes a namespace. Since the
      style of <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> will leave any child elements unqualified,
      the namespace label is stripped and the URI itself is assigned to the
      simple <tt>xmlns</tt> attribute. This will make it apply to any child
      elements of this object. If the object contains other objects as
      children, then they too will be run through this serializer, so they will have
      the chance to declare a namespace in the same way. If there was no label,
      then we take the value of the <tt>uri</tt> attribute, which would have been
      set by calling the <tt>SOAP::Data</tt> method of the same name. Finally,
      we build the array reference using the (possibly modified)
      <tt>$name</tt>, the modified attribute hash reference and an array
      reference of the object's elements, in field order.</p>
	  
    <p>We got the field order by using a symbolic reference to the
      <tt>@FIELDS</tt> array for the object's class. Much the same sort of
      trick is needed to get the <tt>SOAP::Serializer</tt> class to use this
      code. When handed a blessed object, the serializer takes the class name,
      changes all "::" to "__", and prepends "as_" to the result. It then looks
      for a method by that name. It searches using the serialization object
      itself, so the method has to be visible to that class. Right now, there
      isn't a way in <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> to do this more directly. To hook this
      serialization into place, we directly alias "as_Some__Class" into the
      needed package, as shown above.</p>
	  
    <p>Note that the recursive encoding of the object's contents (which may be
      objects themselves) is handled by a <tt>SOAP::Serializer</tt> method
      called "<tt>encode_object</tt>." This is an undocumented part of the
      serializer that was the source of much of the logic for the code snippet
      above. It was by examining this routine that the above code (in a slightly
      different form) was used in writing a complex client to use the
      MapPoint.NET service, one of Microsoft's commercial .NET services.</p></li>
	  
<li><p><b>Play with <tt>stubmaker.pl</tt> and <tt>SOAPsh.pl</tt></b></p>
	
    <p>For the last tip, a more simple piece of advice. The <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt>
      package comes with a number of utility scripts. Among these are a "shell"
      for testing SOAP services, called <tt>SOAPsh.pl</tt>, and a
      code-generation tool for generating classes from WSDL description files,
      called <tt>stubmaker.pl</tt>.</p>
	  
    <p>As was mentioned earlier, WSDL plays a major role in the definition and the 
      documentation of .NET services. The <tt>stubmaker.pl</tt> tool tries to
      create Perl classes based on a WSDL document. It does a fairly good job,
      but it lacks in support for XML Schema. If a service uses any nonbasic
      types, then the template that <tt>stubmaker.pl</tt> generates would not handle
      it as well.</p>
	  
    <p>This should not prevent you from using the tool. It does a lot
      of the heavy lifting by extracting the proper namespace URLs, actual
      server URLs, and remote method names. Even if the code template itself
      cannot be used directly, then it could still save you work.</p></li>
	  
</ol>
	  
    <h3>Summary</h3>
	
    <p>There is much more to properly dealing with .NET services than can be
      addressed in a single article. The goal here is to head off some of the
      more frequently encoutered problems, and let you as the developer focus
      on more important issues.</p>
	  
    <p>One of the biggest drawbacks to using Perl for .NET is that there is
      only limited support at present for WSDL and XML Schema. Some
      new CPAN modules are working to fill these gaps, but they are
      in early stages of functionality. For now, it is still necessary to do
      some of the core steps manually. This situation should improve
      over time.</p>
	  
    <p>As a last "bonus" tip, remember this: Much of the advice here is just as
      important for writing .NET services, as it is for writing
      .NET clients. For the next Web service you write, consider the additional
      client base you would have access to if you wrote it to be compatible
      with .NET.</p>
