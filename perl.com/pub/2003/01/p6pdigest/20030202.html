<p>Piers Cawley worried about class private attributes and asked it it
was still going to be possible to write an object serializing tool
that wouldn't require tons of Perl class overloads. Dan said that it
should still be possible.</p>

<h2><a name="securing_parrot_asm">Securing Parrot ASM</a></h2>
<p>Thomas Whateley has been thinking about how to allow Parrot to run
untrusted code in a sandbox, and proposed a system where code would
provide a list of required rights and Parrot would guarantee that only
those privileges were provided. Matthew Byng-Maddick pointed everyone
at the RFC he'd written along these lines and raised the issue of what
happens when you call out to a module that's written natively, which
he described a 'brick wall'. Others were less sure that this was a
showstopper.</p>
<p>Somewhat annoyingly my mailer seems to have had a bad moment and lost
some messages, including one from Dan in which he outlined his vision
for 'safe mode' and gave some pointers to the VMS docs in this area.</p>

<p>Leon Brocard announced the Parrot Developer World Map, which plots the
locations of all the Parrot developers who sent him their location
details on a map of the world. A cursory glance at the map would seem
to imply that a good place for a Parrot Developers' face to face

<p>Jonathan Sillito found some problems with the coroutine code, so he
wrote a test exposing the errors, patched things to fix the errors and
added a documentation patch to be on the safe side. Go Jonathan. Steve
Fink applied the patches. Jonathan also had a question about naming,
and wondered if anyone would be interested in a howto for compiler
writers. Nobody commented on this, but the howto sounds like a great
idea to me.</p>

<h2><a name="more_array_behaviours">More Array Behaviours</a></h2>
<p>Michael Lazzaro is working on documenting Perl Arrays and asked for
confirmations and clarifications on various areas of Array behaviour.
One subthread morphed into a discussion of when to use <code>is</code>
properties and when to use <code>but</code> properties. It turns out that the
'<code>is</code> is compile time, <code>but</code> is runtime' rule of thumb is only a
rule of thumb. Damian says that a better distinction is '<code>but</code> is a
property on a value, <code>is</code> is a property on a referent'. Variables,
arrays, opaque objects, hashes etc are referents and therefore get
<code>is</code> properties. Values are thing things that are held in variables,
arrays, opaque objects etc, and they get <code>but</code> properties.</p>

<h2><a name="spare_brackets">Spare Brackets</a></h2>
<p>Martin wondered if it would be possible to use <code>[]</code> to do both hash
and array lookups. Short answer ``No''. Which isn't to say the thread
didn't take off like a runaway train. After far too many messages we
reached the same 'No' conclusion that Damian had stated way back a the
start of the thread. The reasoning goes like this: Given <code>&lt;
$container[$spec] </code>&gt; you can't use the type of <code>$container</code> to decide
whether to do a hash or an array lookup because there are Perl object
types which have both hash and array semantics. And you can't use
<code>$spec</code>'s type either because Perl happily autoconverts between
numbers and strings. So, you need some way to specify what sort of
lookup you need, and you do that by using <code>{}</code> or <code>[]</code> as
appropriate. But, frankly, that's beside the point. The reason we're
not using <code>[]</code> to do both array and hash style lookups is Because
Larry Says So.</p>

<h2><a name="arrays:_default_values">Arrays: Default values</a></h2>
<p>Argh! I've really been screwed by problems with my mail here. For some
reason a batch of mail appears to have got dropped on the floor this
week and my record of this thread is the one that's suffered the
most.</p>
<p>The gist of the thread is that adding a default value to an array
opens a whole scary can of worms to do with the distinction between
'undef' and 'exists' (made trickier still by the fact that 'exists' is
a pretty vague concept when you're dealing with an array.) Damian's
view is that an array with a default value should do the equivalent of</p>
<pre>
   $content = @foo[$index] // @foo.default;</pre>
<p>ie, all undefs in the array should be 'replaced' with the array's
default value. And that includes any 'deliberate' undefs (where the
programmer does <code>@foo[$index] = undef</code>). As I understand it, doing
anything else leads to implementation pain. And it leads to even more
fun when your default is computed and the function doing the
computation gets passed the index as an argument. What happens when
someone does a shift?</p>
<p>For some reason this led into a discussion of whether hashes are
ordered (they're not, but if you leave a particular hash alone any
iterators (keys/values/each) will step through the hash in the same
order, repeatably, but that order is not predictable).</p>
