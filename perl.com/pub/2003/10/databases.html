<h3><a name="an_embarrassing_confession">An Embarrassing Confession</a></h3>
<p>I'd like to think that I'm a reasonably decent Perl programmer now. I'd
like to think that I have a good grasp of how to solve relatively
common problems in Perl. But, you know, it hasn't always been this way.
Oh no.</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, when I was a tiny little programmer, I worked as
a trainee Perl coder and systems administrator for a large database
company. Naturally, at a database company, a lot of what we had to do
was talking to databases in Perl. As a fresh-faced programmer, the only
way I knew to interface with databases was through a command-line SQL
client.</p>
<p>I won't embarrass the company in question by giving away the name of the
database, so let's call this SQL client <code>sqlstar</code>. Very soon I was
writing horrendous Perl programs that did things like:</p>
<pre><code>
    my @rows = `sqlstar $database &quot;select * from $table&quot;`;
    for (@rows) {
        ...
    }</code></pre>
<p>Of course, things got terribly confused when we had complex <code>where</code>
clauses, and needed to escape metacharacters, and ...</p>
<pre><code>
    my @rows = `sqlstar $database &quot;select * from $table where
        $row LIKE \&quot;%pattern%\&quot;&quot;`;</code></pre>

<p>The code rapidly got ugly, error-prone, and dangerously unsafe. 
If someone had decided to search for a value with a double quote in it, I
don't know where we'd have been. But for the most part it worked, so
nobody really worried about it.</p>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/522" template="b/article_sidebar.view">

<p>Looking back on programs like that makes me cringe today. Of course, a
better solution is obvious -- but only once someone tells you about it.
And if nobody tells you about it, you could end up writing horrible code
like this until someone does tell you or you get fired.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="the_obvious_solution">The Obvious Solution</a></h3>
<p>So in case anyone hasn't told you yet: there's a better way. The better
way is called the <a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">DBI</a>, the DataBase Interface module. It was
initially written between 1992 and 1994, long before I was messing about
with <code>sqlstar</code> -- so I really have no excuse.</p>
<p>
      You see, there were many problems with my code. Not only was it
      ugly, susceptible to shell breakage, conceptually wrong, and
      inefficient, but it tied my code to the particular database
      engine we were using. Now, given we were a database company,
      it's unlikely that we'd ever be using a different database at
      anytime, but the principle of the thing remains.
</p>
<p>
      Historically, Perl had several different ways to talk to
      databases; back in the days of Perl 4, the best way to
      communicate with a database -- even better than my horrible
      command-line utility hack -- was to use one of the
      specially compiled Perl binaries that included functions for
      driving a database. For instance, there was one called
      <code>oraperl</code>, which allowed you to write code like so:
</p>
    <pre><code>
$lda = &amp;ora_login("master", $user, $pass);
$csr = &amp;ora_open($lda, "select * from $table");
while (@data = &amp;ora_fetch($csr)) {
    # ...
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is obviously a bit of an improvement over the code I was
      writing -- it's a lot more robust, it allows you to do error
      checking on several different levels, and it saves you a lot of
      hassle parsing the output of the command-line tool. It's also
      more efficient, since everything stays inside the one Perl
      process, which again reduces the number of "moving parts" and
      things that can go wrong.
</p>
    <p>
      So these things were a good solution for Perl 4, but along came
      Perl 5 and plug-in modules, and suddenly people found a way to
      solve one of the big problems with these compiled-in database
      libraries. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We've just seen an example of <code>oraperl</code>, which works
      great if you're using Oracle -- and, of course, the version of
      Oracle your Perl was compiled for. If you decide to move your
      program to Informix, you don't have much option than to rewrite
      all your database code; this isn't very practical, especially if
      you want to write code that can be deployed to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Perl 5 solution was Tim Bunce's DBI. As well as providing a
      handy set of functions for all kinds of database access, DBI
      provides an abstraction layer between the Perl code and the
      underlying database, allowing you to switch database
      implementations really easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a little conceptual diagram of how the DBI does its stuff:
    </p>
    <img src="http://dbi.perl.org/images/dbiarch.gif" alt="" />
    <p>
      Your Perl program talks to the DBI, and the DBI talks to
      whichever Database Driver (DBD) is right for your backend
      database. This means that to use the DBI, you need to have four
      things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A C compiler to compile the XS code for DBI and the DBD
	drivers.</li>
      <li>A copy of the <code>DBI</code> module compiled and installed.</li>
      <li>A copy of the relevant client libraries and header files for the database you want to talk to. For instance, on my Debian system, to talk to mysql, I install the <code>libmysqlclient10-dev</code> package.</li>
      <li>The relevant DBD library compiled and installed -- for example, <code>DBD::MySQL</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once that's all up and working, we can start writing some
    database code using the DBI.
    </p>
<h3><a name="using_the_dbi">Using the DBI</a></h3>
<p>
      To connect to a database with the DBI, we need to first construct
      a string that identifies the database we want to connect
      to; this is called a data source name, or DSN. Let's assume
      we're going to be working with a MySQL database called
      "phonebill." (Simply because that's what I was working with
      yesterday.) The DSN for this is made up of three parts, joined by
      colons: first, <code>dbi</code>, since that's what we're using
      to get our data; <code>mysql</code>, since that's the name of
      the driver we want to use to get it; and <code>phonebill</code>,
      since that's the database we're getting it from.
</p>
    <p>
      So, to connect to a database with the DBI, we'd write something
      like this:
</p>
    <pre><code>
use DBI;
my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:phonebill", $user, $password);
</code></pre>
    <p>
      In a lot of cases, you can do without the username and password
      if you're connecting as a local user. However, for a serious
      application, you'll probably want to create a specific user or
      prompt for a password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we have connected to the database, DBI returns us a database
      handle, which is typically stored into a variable called
      <code>$dbh</code>. (Of course, if you're connecting to multiple
      different databases, you may prefer to give it a name that identifies it to a particular database.) Now we have a database
      handle, and we can use it to make queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a query in the DBI takes place in three stages. First,
      you <b>prepare</b> some SQL; then you <b>execute</b> the query;
      finally, you <b>get</b> the results. Let's do that now:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
my $sth = $dbh->prepare(&lt;&lt;SQL);
   select recipient, calldate, calltime, duration
   from call 
   where duration > 60
   order by duration desc
SQL

$sth->execute;

my %calls;
while (my @row = $sth->fetchrow_array()) {
   my ($recipient, $calldate, $calltime, $duration) = @row;
   $calls{$recipient} += $duration;
   print "Called $recipient on $calldate\n";
}

# Now do something with the total times here.
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Why, you might think, do we have to go through these three stages
      just to make an SQL query? Isn't Perl supposed to make things
      easy? Well it does, but it makes different things easy to what
      you're expecting. For instance, suppose you're inserting a lot
      of rows into a table. This is precisely the sort of thing you
      don't want to do:
    </p>
<pre><code>
&lt;![CDATA[
while (my $data = &lt;FILE&gt;) {
    my ($recipient, $date, $time, $duration) = split /:/, $data;
    # DON'T DO THIS
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare(&lt;&lt;SQL);
INSERT INTO call (recipient, calldate, calltime, duration)
VALUES ("$recipient", "$date", "$time", "$duration");
SQL
    # NO REALLY, DON'T DO THIS

    $sth->execute;
}
]]>
</code></pre>

    <p>There are two reasons why this is BAD, BAD, BAD. The first, of
      course, is that the moment someone comes along with a
      double-quote in the file, we're in big trouble. In fact, the
      moment someone comes along with <code>"; DROP DATABASE;</code>
      in the table, we're out of a job.</p>
    <p>
      The second is that it's really inefficient to set up a
      statement, execute it, tear it down, set up a statement,
      execute it, tear it down, and round we go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for the disconnect between preparing a statement and
      executing it is to enable us to use the same statement multiple
      times with slightly different values; we do this by using what
      DBI calls "bind parameters" -- portions of the SQL that will be
      replaced later. For instance, the right way to do our mass
      inserts would be something like this:
    </p>
<pre><code>
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare(&lt;&lt;SQL);
INSERT INTO call (recipient, calldate, calltime, duration)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
SQL

while (my $data = &lt;FILE&gt;) {
    my ($recipient, $date, $time, $duration) = split /:/, $data;
    $sth->execute($recipient, $date, $time, $duration);
}
    </code></pre>
<p>
      Isn't that just so much <i>neater</i>? We've hoisted the
      statement outside the loop, so it only gets prepared once -- much
      more efficient. We specify the parameters we want bound to the
      SQL using question marks, and we pass in the values to the
      <code>execute</code> call.
</p>
<p>
      As an additional bonus, when <code>execute</code> substitutes in
      the bind values to the SQL, it calls the database handle's
      <code>quote</code> method on each one; this is a
      database-specific method, which escapes any nasty characters like
      quotes and semicolons in the input, and makes our code safe
      against the <code>";drop database</code> attack.
</p>
<h3><a name="making_things_easier">Making Things Easier</a></h3>
<p>
      But in many cases, the prepare-execute-fetch process <b>is</b> a
      pain in the neck. Thankfully, DBI provides some easier ways to
      perform SQL statements; it has some canned
      methods that do prepare, execute, and fetch in one go.
</p>
<p>
      The first of these is <code>do</code>, which executes a
      statement when you don't care about the return value, when
      you're not trying to get results back, such as a <code>DELETE</code>:
    </p>
<pre><code>
# Ignore short calls.
$dbh->do("delete from calls where duration &lt; 5");
    </code></pre>
<p>
      For <code>SELECT</code> statements, there are a variety of
      methods that can help out. Perhaps the easiest to use is
      <code>selectall_arrayref</code>. This returns the results of the
      <code>SELECT</code> as an array of arrays:
    </p>
<pre><code>

my $results = $dbh->selectall_arrayref(&lt;&lt;SQL);
   select recipient, calldate, calltime, $duration 
   from call  
   where duration > 60 
   order by duration desc 
SQL

for my $row (@$results) {
   my ($recipient, $calldate, $calltime, $duration) = @$row;
   ...
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      There are many other DBI tricks, too many to go into here; for
      more information check out the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBI">DBI documentation
      page</a>, or the <a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">DBI home
      page</a>; there's also <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perldbi/">Programming the
      Perl DBI</a>, which was co-authored by the creator of DBI.
    </p>
 <h3><a name="where_to_from_here">Where to from Here?</a></h3>
<p>
These days, I actually don't write very much SQL; there are many more
Perlish abstraction layers on top of SQL, such as Tony Bowden's <a href="/pub/a/2002/11/27/classdbi.html"><code>Class::DBI</code></a>,
the <a href="/pub/a/2001/02/dbix.html"><code>DBIx::RecordSet</code></a>,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::SearchBuilder"><code>DBIx::SearchBuilder</code></a>
and many more.
    </p>
<p>
      Additionally, there are some very interesting things going on in the
      world of database servers -- <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/">SQLite</a> is a very fast embedded SQL engine which doesn't require an external server process, and there are Perl bindings to that in the form of <code>DBD::SQLite</code>.
    </p>
<p>
We'll look at some more of these techniques at a later date, but
hopefully this should be enough to get you started using relational
databases in Perl ... and of course, the most important lesson of this
      article: don't worry if you look back at your code after five
      years and cringe -- so do I!
