<p>If you've ever had to do user support, then you'll be familiar with the
following scenario: A question comes in from a user, and you write an
e-mail reply. However, by the time you've hit "send," another
member of your team has already dealt with the problem. Or maybe you're
fortunate enough not to have to support end-users, but you have a
terrible time managing the various projects that you're working on. Or
maybe you just can't remember what you have to do today. How can Perl
help here?</p>

<p>Enter Request Tracker. Request Tracker is a free trouble ticketing
system written in Perl.  It is used widely for everything from bug
tracking and customer support to personal project
management and to-do lists.</p>

<p>Some of you may be familiar with the first edition of Request Tracker,
RT1.  RT1 was successful, but internally, it was a bit
crufty.  RT2 is a complete rewrite designed to be much more capable,
flexible and extensible.</p>

<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>So what is it?</p>

<p>On the simplest level, RT tracks requests - <strong>tickets</strong> - and
correspondence about them.  If you aren't already familiar with such
systems, consider sending a support request to your ISP.  It might go
something like this:</p>
<pre>
        You: My e-mail isn't working.

        ISP: Have you looked at the FAQ list?  
		Can you be more specific about what isn't working.

        You: When I hit send in mumble mailer, it says 
		&quot;Cannot connect to server&quot;

        ISP: Please make sure you have your SMTP server configured 
		as documented ...

        You: Thanks!  That did it!</pre>
		
<p>This exchange most likely won't happen all at once, and could happen
over the span of several days involving several technicians from your
ISP.  Each technician will want to know the specifics of what the
previous technician told you, and your response.  The ISP will also
want to know who is handling a particular ticket, how long it's been
open, how many total tickets are open, what category your ticket falls
into ("e-mail problems"), etc.  This is the problem that RT was built
to solve.  Some companies use tools such as "Remedy" or "Clarify" for similar
purposes, but RT is a free and open-source solution.</p>

<p>RT isn't only for help-desk situations.  The same system can be used to
track bugs in software, outstanding action items or any other issue.
In this domain, RT overlaps with programs such as Bugzilla and Gnats. In
fact, RT's being used by the Perl 6 developers to track what they need
to work on.</p>

<h3><a name="presentation and interface">Presentation and Interface</a></h3>

<p>RT provides the most natural way of displaying exchanges such as the one
in the example above. Every <strong>request</strong> is displayed as a sequence of
<strong>transactions</strong>, starting with the initial message that created it.  A
transaction can also represent a change in metadata - for instance, the
person who is working on a ticket may change as another member of the
team takes over, or the ticket may be re-prioritized; it can change its
status to reflect whether it's new, open, resolved or waiting for
more input from the requestor.</p>

<p>Requests live in <strong>queue</strong>s, where a queue provides a loose grouping of 
both what the ticket is about and who is likely to respond to it. For
instance, queries to the Web master of a site could end up in the "web"
queue, whereas each development team would have a queue per project they
were working on.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of ways to get data into RT.  The two most popular are
the Web interface and the e-mail interface. You can also have RT
automatically insert data from CVS commit logs, via command-line
interface or through more specialist tools.</p>

<p>The e-mail interface is easy to use and uses a simple tag in the
subject line to determine what to do with a message.  This tag will
generally look like <code>[site #40]</code> where "site" is a special tag
identifying your RT setup and the number (40) is the ticket number.
All e-mails sent to RT with that information in the subject will be
appended to the appropriate request.  Most RT systems are configured
so that an e-mail without a recognized tag in the subject line automatically
creates a new request.</p>
<pre>

    From: John Doe &lt;john@doe.com&gt;
    To: rt@myisp.com
    Subject: Re: [myisp #3120] Email doesn't work
    Date: Tue Nov 27 21:57:58 PST 2001

    I tried to configure Netscape Communicator as your instructions
    said, but I'm still getting the same error as before.  What else
    would you suggest?</pre>

<p>The Web interface allows for more flexible display of the information
about a ticket.  You can enter new information about a ticket or change
its metadata.</p>
<p>
<img src="/pub/2001/11/28/graphics/rt-display.jpg"><p>
<h3><a name="metadata">Meta-data</a></h3>

<p>RT stores lots of information about each ticket.  By default, it
maintains information about the requestor, owner, (the person who's
currently working on the ticket) status, subject, creation date, due
date, priority, queue, links to other tickets, as well as the people who
are interested in that particular ticket.</p>
<p>This information is important for sorting, categorization and
reporting.  RT also allows for custom meta-data to be added to a ticket
in the form of keywords.  Returning to our ISP example, they might
configure their RT setup to record the platform and software being used.
One reason to do this is so that specialists can be assigned to focus on
issues in their areas of specialization. Similarly, you can gather
statistics on, say, the number of users reporting problems using Outlook
Express.</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a side note, it's important to note that it's impossible to present
all the possible configurations of RT in this article.  As we'll
continue to see later, it's extremely flexible and each organization
will need to configure it for their particular needs.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="scrips and templates">Scrips and Templates</a></h3>
<p>As configured "out of the box," RT does not send any e-mail by
default.  The end user needs to use the Web interface to configure
RT's "scrips."  Scrips are a way of telling RT to trigger certain
actions based on when something happens.</p>
<p>For example, one important scrip would be:</p>
<pre>
   When a new ticket is opened, send an e-mail to the person who created it.</pre>
   
<p>This way, your requestor would get an autoresponse telling them
that their query was being looked at. Another useful scrip would be:</p>

<pre>
   When someone e-mails new information into a ticket, send that information
   to everyone who is interested in the ticket.</pre>
   <p>
<img src="/pub/2001/11/28/graphics/rt-scrips.jpg"></p>
<h3><a name="correspondence and comments">Correspondence and Comments</a></h3>

<p>One important aspect of RT is how it differentiates between
<strong>correspondence</strong> and <strong>comments</strong>. Correspondence is something that is
sent by one of the RT users to the requestor, to solicit further
information or inform them of developments; comments are normally set up
to be internal to RT users, and never sent to the end-user. Think of
it as being the support team's chance to be rude to the end-user behind
their back.</p>
<p>RT is smart. When correspondence is e-mailed out to the user, it appears
as if the author had written it, but has a tweaked From: line so that
replies are also sent back into RT and added to the ticket.</p>
<h3><a name="the isp, using rt">The ISP, using RT</a></h3>

<p>Here is the above ISP example, as it might look as an RT ticket:</p>

<h3><a name="the guts">The Guts</a></h3>
<p>You may be thinking that RT is a horribly complicated piece of
software, impossible to understand, use and extend.  If you are,
you're completely wrong.  Through extensive modularization and a well
thought out architecture and design, RT is quite easy to understand,
use and extend.</p>
<p>RT2 is built upon standard modules that many people use.  There isn't
anything esoteric used; in fact, you may already be using many of the
modules on which it depends.</p>
<p>But you might think that installing all the dependent modules might be a
chore. Again, RT is smart. It comes with a script that uses the CPAN.pm
module to retrieve and install the correct versions of everything it
needs.</p>
<p>This is probably the hardest part of installing RT.  (Assuming you
have CPAN.pm configured properly.) You run "make fixdeps," and it all
happens for you.  It may be necessary to run it multiple times or
install one or two modules by hand, but that's easy compared to
manually installing almost 30 modules.</p>

<p title="Modules Required by RT2">
<pre>
 DBI DBIx::DataSource DBIx::SearchBuilder HTML::Entities MLDBM
 Net::Domain Net::SMTP Params::Validate HTML::Mason CGI::Cookie
 Apache::Cookie Apache::Session Date::Parse Date::Format MIME::Entity
 Mail::Mailer Getopt::Long Tie::IxHash Text::Wrapper Text::Template
 File::Spec Errno FreezeThaw File::Temp Log::Dispatch DBD::mysql or DBD::Pg</pre>
</p>

<p>The most important module is probably <code>DBIx::SearchBuilder</code>.  It
provides a standard mechanism for persistent object-oriented storage. By
using it, RT doesn't need to worry about the details of the SQL queries
to access its database.  The details of <code>DBIx::SearchBuilder</code> are
beyond the scope of this article - in fact, they'll be covered in a
future perl.com article - but in a nutshell, your classes will subclass
the <code>SearchBuilder</code> class, and the module will take care of the
persistence for you. <code>SearchBuilder</code> also makes it easy to port RT to
your SQL backend of choice; since it's all done through the <code>DBI</code>, the
architecture is completely database-independent.</p>

<h3><a name="configurability & extensibility">Configurability &amp; Extensibility</a></h3>
<p>Ninety-five percent of RT is configured via the Web interface.  Once the system is up
and running, most changes can be made through the Configuration
menu. Everything from adding users to configuring automatic e-mail
responses can be done there.</p>
<p>Because the Web interface is created using <code>HTML::Mason</code>, it's easy to
extend RT using the internal API.  Whole pages or just individual Mason
elements can be easily overridden or updated.  Common customizations
include specialized reports, user interface tweaks or new authentication
systems. Any trouble ticketing system will need adapting to the needs of
the local users, and RT makes it easy to do this. The API by which the
Mason site accesses the ticketing database is the same thing that all of
the interfaces use natively, so it's possible to completely re-implement
any interface from scratch - in fact, you can write your own tools to
access the system quickly and easily by using the <code>RT::*</code> modules in
your own code.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Currently, I'm using RT for several different projects.  Here are a
few more details about each RT setup to provide you with more ideas
and examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Bug_Tracking">Bug Tracking</a></strong><br>

As mentioned above, the perl 6 project is using RT to track bugs and
todo items. Right now the Parrot project has one queue set up; this is a
little slow at the moment, but will be ramping up as Parrot stabilizes.  A
custom report was written to show only items marked with the "Todo"
keyword, so that we can update a Web page listing the things that need
doing.  The scrips are configured to keep the requestor in the loop with
the progress of their issue.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Help%2DDesk">Help-Desk</a></strong><br>

perl.org maintains many mailing lists, which means dealing with lots
of users who have trouble subscribing, or more likely unsubscribing
from lists.  The <a href="mailto:list-owner@perl.org">list-owner@perl.org</a> e-mail address is filtered into
RT, where a ticket is created automatically.  Thus, each user's case can
be tracked.  For this, we wrote a special template system that allows
us to easily insert common answers into correspondence.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Project_Management">Project Management</a></strong><br>

This is similar to bug tracking, but doesn't require the same kind of
notification or categorization.  At perl.org we use our RT setup to
track the status of a variety of internal projects, such as our CVS
server and Web site development.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Personal_Todo_and_Information_Store">Personal Todo and Information Store</a></strong><br>

At home, I use RT as "yet another TODO list" and information store.
Instead of cluttering my e-mail inbox, or stuffing things into folders
where I might forget about them, I open tickets in my "personal RT."
I can then categorize them and add comments to them.  There are a
range of different things I stick into RT, ranging from "Remember to
look at this Web site" to "Get new cellphone."  For the latter, I add
comments that include the details of my research.  I can easily
access this from work or anywhere there is Web access.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="more!">More!</a></h3>
<p>There's a lot more to RT than I've covered in this article.  Some
things I've glossed over include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Access_control">Access control</a></strong><br>

RT has a sophisticated access control system that supports
different levels of access to tickets based on a user's identity, group
memberships or role.  You can grant permissions globally or per queue.
It's possible to configure read-only access or only allow someone to
see tickets they requested.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Command_Line_Interface">Command Line Interface</a></strong><br>

There is a full-featured command line interface that allows you
to do almost anything.  This provides another way to script and
customize things.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Scalability">Scalability</a></strong><br>

Request Tracker is very scalable and is being used in production
environments with several tens of thousands of tickets in the
database.  (Not on a 486, of course.)
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="future directions">Future Directions</a></h3>
<p>The current version of RT2 is 2.0.9.  The 2.1 development series will
be starting soon leading toward 2.2.  While nothing has been
finalized, items on the table for 2.2 include better ACL support, more
flexible keywords, asset trackin, and several other cool things.</p>

<h3><a name="best practical">Best Practical</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Support for Request Tracker is available from Best
Practical Solutions, LLC.  Best Practical Solutions was formed by RT's
author, Jesse Vincent, to sell support and custom development for RT.
