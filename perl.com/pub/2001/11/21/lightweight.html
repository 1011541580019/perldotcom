      What happens if you get a bunch of academic computer scientists
      and implementors of languages such as Perl, Python, Smalltalk and
      Curl, and lock them into a room for a day? Bringing together the
      academic and commercial sides of language design and
      implementation was the interesting premise behind last weekend's
      Lightweight Languages Workshop, <A
      href="http://ll1.mit.edu">LL1</a>, at the AI Lab at MIT, and I'm
      happy to say that it wasn't the great flame-fest you might
      imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there were the occasional jibes from all sides, (and
      mainly in our direction) it was a good-natured and enjoyable
      event.  The one-day workshop began with a keynote by Olin
      Shivers, associate professor of computing at Georgia Tech, on
      how "Lambda" was the ultimate little language. He was, of
      course, teaching us about the Joys of Scheme. Olin showed us how
      we could use Scheme as a basis for implementing domain-specific
      languages, such as awk, and by embedding these languages in
      Scheme, one would have not just the power of the original
      language, but also the implementation language available as
      well. The alert reader will remember that this is something
      Larry spoke about in the State of the Onion this year with
      regard to Perl 6, and something that Damian Conway and Leon
      Brocard have been working on in Perl 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olin demonstrated the power of his "embedding" technique by
      calling from Scheme to Awk and from Awk back into Scheme in the
      same routine. He's even written a <a
      href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh">Scheme shell </a>
      along the same lines, but there was some disagreement as to
      whether or not being able to do shell-like things with Scheme
      syntax means you have a Scheme shell. Olin also brushed aside
      suggestions that writing Awk, Scheme and Shell in the same
      syntax in the same function might be potentially confusing,
      saying that it had never tripped him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came an enlightening panel discussion on the merits of <A
      href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">the
      Worse-Is-Better philosophy</a>; that is, the idea, that doing it
      right is not as important as doing it right now. I spoke first,
      explaining how Parrot development has to strike a balance
      between being correct, maintainable and fast, and ended by
      asking why doing the right thing is almost always the opposite
      of doing the fast thing; Jeremy Hylton, one of the Python
      developers and a really nice guy, replied that Python did not
      have this problem - for them, correctness and maintainability
      were more important than performance, giving them more
      flexibility in terms of doing it Right.

    </p>


    <p>
      Dan Weinreb piped up with the idea that programming
      implementation tends to be driven by managerial paranoia;
      thankfully, this is something that both the open-source
      language implementation community and the academic community are
      pretty much immune from. Nevertheless, the pressure to release
      can have adverse affects on future performance, as illustrated
      by Guy Steele, one of the designers on Java, who told us a sad
      story about the dangers of Worse Is Better - by putting some
      vital component of Java (I think it was tail recursion, but it
      might have been something else) off in order to get release 1.0
      out of the door, it made it much harder to implement later
      on. This resonated with the experience that Python implementors
      had adding lexical scoping. This rapidly caused a degeneration
      into whether a language without lexical scoping or the
      lambda operator can be said to be properly thought out. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Joe Marshall gave a short talk on one element of the initial
      implementation of the Rebol programming language. Rebol 1.0 was
      slightly different from the "network programming language" that
      Rebol is today - it was essentially Scheme with the brackets
      filed off. He explained that in his original Scheme
      implementation, he used a terribly complicated trick to avoid
      outgrowing the stack; something that was completely rewritten
      in the next implementation. Again we found that maintainability
      was more important in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Hylton then gave his presentation, on the design and
      implementation of Python. It was amusing but, at least to me,
      not entirely surprising, that Jeremy was the one developer at
      the conference that Dan Sugalski and I had most in common
      with. The implementation teams of Perl and Python are facing
      very much the same problems and approaching them in only very
      slightly different ways. That is, compared with many of the
      other approaches we saw presented, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was our turn. We were running very late by this point,
      so I skipped over most of my talk; Dan explained what a
      lightweight language usually needed from its interpreter, and
      how Parrot was planning to provide that. David Simmons, one of
      the developers of SmallScript, a "scripting" Smalltalk
      implementation, challenged us on the viability of JIT compiling
      Parrot code, something we were interested in after looking at
      the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono project</a>'s JIT compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been intrigued all day by the title of Shriram
      Krishnamurthi's talk, "The Swine Before Perl." We didn't know whether
      that referred to us or to Jeremy, who was talking before us. In
      the event, Shriram delivered a wonderfully interesting
      presentation about Scheme, and how he could apply "laziness,
      impatience and hubris" to Scheme programming. He mentioned a
      Scheme Web server that served dynamic pages many times faster
      than Apache/mod_perl, and a way of manipulating Scheme macros to
      provide a pre-compiled state-machine generator. He countered
      criticisms that Scheme is just lots of insane silly parentheses
      by demonstrating how XML was just lots of insane silly angle
      brackets. A fair point well made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar Horwat lead us through some of the more important
      design decisions involved in JavaScript version 2.0. No, don't
      laugh, it's a much more fully featured language than you'd
      think. His main point was, unsurpisingly, something else that
      Larry had picked up on in his State of the Onion talk; that
      modules need to provide ways of encoding the version of their
      API so as to protect their namespace from subclasses. That's to
      say, if there's a Perl module <code>Foo</code> and you
      subclass it to <code>Foo::Advanced</code> by adding a
      <code>frobnitz</code> method, then what happens when the original
      author of <code>Foo</code> produces the next version of
      <code>Foo</code> that already has a <code>frobnitz</code>
      method? Waldemar's solution was to use version-specific
      namespaces that only expose certain subsets of the whole API if
      a particular version number is asked for. This allows
      dependent modules to be future-proofed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher Barber gave a talk on Curl, a bizarre little
      language that fills the same sort of niche as Flash. David
      Simmons spoke about SmallScript and his work porting Smalltalk
      to the Microsoft CLR; he had high hopes for the way Microsoft
      .NET was panning out. Jonathan Bachrach, one of the AI Labs
      researchers gave a clever talk, which I missed due to
      being out in the corridors debating the finer points of
      threading and continuations with a Scheme hacker. I returned to
      see him explain a efficient but highly difficult to follow
      method of determining whether two classes are the same; he also
      said that his language compiles down to C and the C compiler is
      executed on the fly, since it's faster to call GCC than to start
      up your own virtual machine. Paul Graham rounded off the talks
      by talking about his new dialect of Lisp, which he called
      Arc. Arc is designed to be a language for "good programmers"
      only, and gets away without taking the shortcuts and safeguards
      that you need if you're trying to be accessible. His
      presentation was very entertaining, and I have high hopes for
      his little language.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I've indicated, the interest of the workshop was as much what
      was going on outside the talks as well; Dan and I got to meet a
      load of interesting and clever people, and it was
      challenging for us to discuss our ideas with them - especially
      since we didn't always see eye to eye with our academic
      counterparts. Sadly, few people seemed to have heard much about
      <A HREF="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, something they
      will probably come to regret in time. Dan seemed to have picked
      up a few more interesting technical tips, such as a way to
      collect reference count loops without walking all of the objects
      in a heap. Oh, and we found that you should pour liquid
      nitrogen into containers first rather than trying to make
      ice cream by directly pouring it into a mix of milk and
      butter. And that the ice-cream so produced is exceptionally tasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seriously, what did we learn? I think we learned that many problems that we're facing in terms of Perl implementation
      right now have already been thoroughly researched and dealt with
      as many as 30 years ago; but we also learned that if we want to
      get at this research, then we need to do a lot of digging. The
      academic community is good at solving tricky problems like
      threading, continuations, despatch and the like, but not very
      interested in working out all the implications. To bring an
      academic success to commercial fruition requires one, as Olin
      Shivers puts it, "to become Larry Wall for a year" - to take
      care of all the gritty implementation details, and that's not
      the sort of thing that gets a PhD.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So the impetus is on us as serious language implementors to take
      the time to look into and understand the current state of the
      art in VM research to avoid re-inventing the wheel. Conferences
      such as LL1, and the mailing list that has been established as a
      result of it, are a useful way for us to find out what's
      going on and exchange experience with the academic community,
      and I look forward intently to the next one!
