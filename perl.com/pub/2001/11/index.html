<p>If you've ever had to do user support, then you'll be familiar with the
following scenario: A question comes in from a user, and you write an
e-mail reply. However, by the time you've hit "send," another
member of your team has already dealt with the problem. Or maybe you're
fortunate enough not to have to support end-users, but you have a
terrible time managing the various projects that you're working on. Or
maybe you just can't remember what you have to do today. How can Perl
help here?</p>

<p>Enter Request Tracker. Request Tracker is a free trouble ticketing
system written in Perl.  It is used widely for everything from bug
tracking and customer support to personal project
management and to-do lists.</p>

<p>Some of you may be familiar with the first edition of Request Tracker,
RT1.  RT1 was successful, but internally, it was a bit
crufty.  RT2 is a complete rewrite designed to be much more capable,
flexible and extensible.</p>

<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>So what is it?</p>

<p>On the simplest level, RT tracks requests - <strong>tickets</strong> - and
correspondence about them.  If you aren't already familiar with such
systems, consider sending a support request to your ISP.  It might go
something like this:</p>
<pre>
        You: My e-mail isn't working.

        ISP: Have you looked at the FAQ list?  
		Can you be more specific about what isn't working.

        You: When I hit send in mumble mailer, it says 
		&quot;Cannot connect to server&quot;

        ISP: Please make sure you have your SMTP server configured 
		as documented ...

        You: Thanks!  That did it!</pre>
		
<p>This exchange most likely won't happen all at once, and could happen
over the span of several days involving several technicians from your
ISP.  Each technician will want to know the specifics of what the
previous technician told you, and your response.  The ISP will also
want to know who is handling a particular ticket, how long it's been
open, how many total tickets are open, what category your ticket falls
into ("e-mail problems"), etc.  This is the problem that RT was built
to solve.  Some companies use tools such as "Remedy" or "Clarify" for similar
purposes, but RT is a free and open-source solution.</p>

<p>RT isn't only for help-desk situations.  The same system can be used to
track bugs in software, outstanding action items or any other issue.
In this domain, RT overlaps with programs such as Bugzilla and Gnats. In
fact, RT's being used by the Perl 6 developers to track what they need
to work on.</p>

<h3><a name="presentation and interface">Presentation and Interface</a></h3>

<p>RT provides the most natural way of displaying exchanges such as the one
in the example above. Every <strong>request</strong> is displayed as a sequence of
<strong>transactions</strong>, starting with the initial message that created it.  A
transaction can also represent a change in metadata - for instance, the
person who is working on a ticket may change as another member of the
team takes over, or the ticket may be re-prioritized; it can change its
status to reflect whether it's new, open, resolved or waiting for
more input from the requestor.</p>

<p>Requests live in <strong>queue</strong>s, where a queue provides a loose grouping of 
both what the ticket is about and who is likely to respond to it. For
instance, queries to the Web master of a site could end up in the "web"
queue, whereas each development team would have a queue per project they
were working on.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of ways to get data into RT.  The two most popular are
the Web interface and the e-mail interface. You can also have RT
automatically insert data from CVS commit logs, via command-line
interface or through more specialist tools.</p>

<p>The e-mail interface is easy to use and uses a simple tag in the
subject line to determine what to do with a message.  This tag will
generally look like <code>[site #40]</code> where "site" is a special tag
identifying your RT setup and the number (40) is the ticket number.
All e-mails sent to RT with that information in the subject will be
appended to the appropriate request.  Most RT systems are configured
so that an e-mail without a recognized tag in the subject line automatically
creates a new request.</p>
<pre>

    From: John Doe &lt;john@doe.com&gt;
    To: rt@myisp.com
    Subject: Re: [myisp #3120] Email doesn't work
    Date: Tue Nov 27 21:57:58 PST 2001

    I tried to configure Netscape Communicator as your instructions
    said, but I'm still getting the same error as before.  What else
    would you suggest?</pre>

<p>The Web interface allows for more flexible display of the information
about a ticket.  You can enter new information about a ticket or change
its metadata.</p>
<p>
<img src="/pub/2001/11/28/graphics/rt-display.jpg"><p>
<h3><a name="metadata">Meta-data</a></h3>

<p>RT stores lots of information about each ticket.  By default, it
maintains information about the requestor, owner, (the person who's
currently working on the ticket) status, subject, creation date, due
date, priority, queue, links to other tickets, as well as the people who
are interested in that particular ticket.</p>
<p>This information is important for sorting, categorization and
reporting.  RT also allows for custom meta-data to be added to a ticket
in the form of keywords.  Returning to our ISP example, they might
configure their RT setup to record the platform and software being used.
One reason to do this is so that specialists can be assigned to focus on
issues in their areas of specialization. Similarly, you can gather
statistics on, say, the number of users reporting problems using Outlook
Express.</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a side note, it's important to note that it's impossible to present
all the possible configurations of RT in this article.  As we'll
continue to see later, it's extremely flexible and each organization
will need to configure it for their particular needs.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="scrips and templates">Scrips and Templates</a></h3>
<p>As configured "out of the box," RT does not send any e-mail by
default.  The end user needs to use the Web interface to configure
RT's "scrips."  Scrips are a way of telling RT to trigger certain
actions based on when something happens.</p>
<p>For example, one important scrip would be:</p>
<pre>
   When a new ticket is opened, send an e-mail to the person who created it.</pre>
   
<p>This way, your requestor would get an autoresponse telling them
that their query was being looked at. Another useful scrip would be:</p>

<pre>
   When someone e-mails new information into a ticket, send that information
   to everyone who is interested in the ticket.</pre>
   <p>
<img src="/pub/2001/11/28/graphics/rt-scrips.jpg"></p>
<h3><a name="correspondence and comments">Correspondence and Comments</a></h3>

<p>One important aspect of RT is how it differentiates between
<strong>correspondence</strong> and <strong>comments</strong>. Correspondence is something that is
sent by one of the RT users to the requestor, to solicit further
information or inform them of developments; comments are normally set up
to be internal to RT users, and never sent to the end-user. Think of
it as being the support team's chance to be rude to the end-user behind
their back.</p>
<p>RT is smart. When correspondence is e-mailed out to the user, it appears
as if the author had written it, but has a tweaked From: line so that
replies are also sent back into RT and added to the ticket.</p>
<h3><a name="the isp, using rt">The ISP, using RT</a></h3>

<h3><a name="the guts">The Guts</a></h3>
<p>You may be thinking that RT is a horribly complicated piece of
software, impossible to understand, use and extend.  If you are,
you're completely wrong.  Through extensive modularization and a well
thought out architecture and design, RT is quite easy to understand,
use and extend.</p>
<p>RT2 is built upon standard modules that many people use.  There isn't
anything esoteric used; in fact, you may already be using many of the
modules on which it depends.</p>
<p>But you might think that installing all the dependent modules might be a
chore. Again, RT is smart. It comes with a script that uses the CPAN.pm
module to retrieve and install the correct versions of everything it
needs.</p>
<p>This is probably the hardest part of installing RT.  (Assuming you
have CPAN.pm configured properly.) You run "make fixdeps," and it all
happens for you.  It may be necessary to run it multiple times or
install one or two modules by hand, but that's easy compared to
manually installing almost 30 modules.</p>

<p title="Modules Required by RT2">
<pre>
 DBI DBIx::DataSource DBIx::SearchBuilder HTML::Entities MLDBM
 Net::Domain Net::SMTP Params::Validate HTML::Mason CGI::Cookie
 Apache::Cookie Apache::Session Date::Parse Date::Format MIME::Entity
 Mail::Mailer Getopt::Long Tie::IxHash Text::Wrapper Text::Template
 File::Spec Errno FreezeThaw File::Temp Log::Dispatch DBD::mysql or DBD::Pg</pre>
</p>

<p>The most important module is probably <code>DBIx::SearchBuilder</code>.  It
provides a standard mechanism for persistent object-oriented storage. By
using it, RT doesn't need to worry about the details of the SQL queries
to access its database.  The details of <code>DBIx::SearchBuilder</code> are
beyond the scope of this article - in fact, they'll be covered in a
future perl.com article - but in a nutshell, your classes will subclass
the <code>SearchBuilder</code> class, and the module will take care of the
persistence for you. <code>SearchBuilder</code> also makes it easy to port RT to
your SQL backend of choice; since it's all done through the <code>DBI</code>, the
architecture is completely database-independent.</p>

<h3><a name="configurability & extensibility">Configurability &amp; Extensibility</a></h3>
<p>Ninety-five percent of RT is configured via the Web interface.  Once the system is up
and running, most changes can be made through the Configuration
menu. Everything from adding users to configuring automatic e-mail
responses can be done there.</p>
<p>Because the Web interface is created using <code>HTML::Mason</code>, it's easy to
extend RT using the internal API.  Whole pages or just individual Mason
elements can be easily overridden or updated.  Common customizations
include specialized reports, user interface tweaks or new authentication
systems. Any trouble ticketing system will need adapting to the needs of
the local users, and RT makes it easy to do this. The API by which the
Mason site accesses the ticketing database is the same thing that all of
the interfaces use natively, so it's possible to completely re-implement
any interface from scratch - in fact, you can write your own tools to
access the system quickly and easily by using the <code>RT::*</code> modules in
your own code.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Currently, I'm using RT for several different projects.  Here are a
few more details about each RT setup to provide you with more ideas
and examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Bug_Tracking">Bug Tracking</a></strong><br>

As mentioned above, the perl 6 project is using RT to track bugs and
todo items. Right now the Parrot project has one queue set up; this is a
little slow at the moment, but will be ramping up as Parrot stabilizes.  A
custom report was written to show only items marked with the "Todo"
keyword, so that we can update a Web page listing the things that need
doing.  The scrips are configured to keep the requestor in the loop with
the progress of their issue.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Help%2DDesk">Help-Desk</a></strong><br>

perl.org maintains many mailing lists, which means dealing with lots
of users who have trouble subscribing, or more likely unsubscribing
from lists.  The <a href="mailto:list-owner@perl.org">list-owner@perl.org</a> e-mail address is filtered into
RT, where a ticket is created automatically.  Thus, each user's case can
be tracked.  For this, we wrote a special template system that allows
us to easily insert common answers into correspondence.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Project_Management">Project Management</a></strong><br>

This is similar to bug tracking, but doesn't require the same kind of
notification or categorization.  At perl.org we use our RT setup to
track the status of a variety of internal projects, such as our CVS
server and Web site development.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Personal_Todo_and_Information_Store">Personal Todo and Information Store</a></strong><br>

At home, I use RT as "yet another TODO list" and information store.
Instead of cluttering my e-mail inbox, or stuffing things into folders
where I might forget about them, I open tickets in my "personal RT."
I can then categorize them and add comments to them.  There are a
range of different things I stick into RT, ranging from "Remember to
look at this Web site" to "Get new cellphone."  For the latter, I add
comments that include the details of my research.  I can easily
access this from work or anywhere there is Web access.
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="more!">More!</a></h3>
<p>There's a lot more to RT than I've covered in this article.  Some
things I've glossed over include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_Access_control">Access control</a></strong><br>

RT has a sophisticated access control system that supports
different levels of access to tickets based on a user's identity, group
memberships or role.  You can grant permissions globally or per queue.
It's possible to configure read-only access or only allow someone to
see tickets they requested.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Command_Line_Interface">Command Line Interface</a></strong><br>

There is a full-featured command line interface that allows you
to do almost anything.  This provides another way to script and
customize things.
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_Scalability">Scalability</a></strong><br>

Request Tracker is very scalable and is being used in production
environments with several tens of thousands of tickets in the
database.  (Not on a 486, of course.)
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="future directions">Future Directions</a></h3>
<p>The current version of RT2 is 2.0.9.  The 2.1 development series will
be starting soon leading toward 2.2.  While nothing has been
finalized, items on the table for 2.2 include better ACL support, more
flexible keywords, asset trackin, and several other cool things.</p>

<h3><a name="best practical">Best Practical</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Support for Request Tracker is available from Best

      What happens if you get a bunch of academic computer scientists
      and implementors of languages such as Perl, Python, Smalltalk and
      Curl, and lock them into a room for a day? Bringing together the
      academic and commercial sides of language design and
      implementation was the interesting premise behind last weekend's
      Lightweight Languages Workshop, <A
      href="http://ll1.mit.edu">LL1</a>, at the AI Lab at MIT, and I'm
      happy to say that it wasn't the great flame-fest you might
      imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there were the occasional jibes from all sides, (and
      mainly in our direction) it was a good-natured and enjoyable
      event.  The one-day workshop began with a keynote by Olin
      Shivers, associate professor of computing at Georgia Tech, on
      how "Lambda" was the ultimate little language. He was, of
      course, teaching us about the Joys of Scheme. Olin showed us how
      we could use Scheme as a basis for implementing domain-specific
      languages, such as awk, and by embedding these languages in
      Scheme, one would have not just the power of the original
      language, but also the implementation language available as
      well. The alert reader will remember that this is something
      Larry spoke about in the State of the Onion this year with
      regard to Perl 6, and something that Damian Conway and Leon
      Brocard have been working on in Perl 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olin demonstrated the power of his "embedding" technique by
      calling from Scheme to Awk and from Awk back into Scheme in the
      same routine. He's even written a <a
      href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/ftpdir/scsh">Scheme shell </a>
      along the same lines, but there was some disagreement as to
      whether or not being able to do shell-like things with Scheme
      syntax means you have a Scheme shell. Olin also brushed aside
      suggestions that writing Awk, Scheme and Shell in the same
      syntax in the same function might be potentially confusing,
      saying that it had never tripped him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came an enlightening panel discussion on the merits of <A
      href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">the
      Worse-Is-Better philosophy</a>; that is, the idea, that doing it
      right is not as important as doing it right now. I spoke first,
      explaining how Parrot development has to strike a balance
      between being correct, maintainable and fast, and ended by
      asking why doing the right thing is almost always the opposite
      of doing the fast thing; Jeremy Hylton, one of the Python
      developers and a really nice guy, replied that Python did not
      have this problem - for them, correctness and maintainability
      were more important than performance, giving them more
      flexibility in terms of doing it Right.

    </p>


    <p>
      Dan Weinreb piped up with the idea that programming
      implementation tends to be driven by managerial paranoia;
      thankfully, this is something that both the open-source
      language implementation community and the academic community are
      pretty much immune from. Nevertheless, the pressure to release
      can have adverse affects on future performance, as illustrated
      by Guy Steele, one of the designers on Java, who told us a sad
      story about the dangers of Worse Is Better - by putting some
      vital component of Java (I think it was tail recursion, but it
      might have been something else) off in order to get release 1.0
      out of the door, it made it much harder to implement later
      on. This resonated with the experience that Python implementors
      had adding lexical scoping. This rapidly caused a degeneration
      into whether a language without lexical scoping or the
      lambda operator can be said to be properly thought out. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Joe Marshall gave a short talk on one element of the initial
      implementation of the Rebol programming language. Rebol 1.0 was
      slightly different from the "network programming language" that
      Rebol is today - it was essentially Scheme with the brackets
      filed off. He explained that in his original Scheme
      implementation, he used a terribly complicated trick to avoid
      outgrowing the stack; something that was completely rewritten
      in the next implementation. Again we found that maintainability
      was more important in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremy Hylton then gave his presentation, on the design and
      implementation of Python. It was amusing but, at least to me,
      not entirely surprising, that Jeremy was the one developer at
      the conference that Dan Sugalski and I had most in common
      with. The implementation teams of Perl and Python are facing
      very much the same problems and approaching them in only very
      slightly different ways. That is, compared with many of the
      other approaches we saw presented, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was our turn. We were running very late by this point,
      so I skipped over most of my talk; Dan explained what a
      lightweight language usually needed from its interpreter, and
      how Parrot was planning to provide that. David Simmons, one of
      the developers of SmallScript, a "scripting" Smalltalk
      implementation, challenged us on the viability of JIT compiling
      Parrot code, something we were interested in after looking at
      the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono project</a>'s JIT compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been intrigued all day by the title of Shriram
      Krishnamurthi's talk, "The Swine Before Perl." We didn't know whether
      that referred to us or to Jeremy, who was talking before us. In
      the event, Shriram delivered a wonderfully interesting
      presentation about Scheme, and how he could apply "laziness,
      impatience and hubris" to Scheme programming. He mentioned a
      Scheme Web server that served dynamic pages many times faster
      than Apache/mod_perl, and a way of manipulating Scheme macros to
      provide a pre-compiled state-machine generator. He countered
      criticisms that Scheme is just lots of insane silly parentheses
      by demonstrating how XML was just lots of insane silly angle
      brackets. A fair point well made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waldemar Horwat lead us through some of the more important
      design decisions involved in JavaScript version 2.0. No, don't
      laugh, it's a much more fully featured language than you'd
      think. His main point was, unsurpisingly, something else that
      Larry had picked up on in his State of the Onion talk; that
      modules need to provide ways of encoding the version of their
      API so as to protect their namespace from subclasses. That's to
      say, if there's a Perl module <code>Foo</code> and you
      subclass it to <code>Foo::Advanced</code> by adding a
      <code>frobnitz</code> method, then what happens when the original
      author of <code>Foo</code> produces the next version of
      <code>Foo</code> that already has a <code>frobnitz</code>
      method? Waldemar's solution was to use version-specific
      namespaces that only expose certain subsets of the whole API if
      a particular version number is asked for. This allows
      dependent modules to be future-proofed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christopher Barber gave a talk on Curl, a bizarre little
      language that fills the same sort of niche as Flash. David
      Simmons spoke about SmallScript and his work porting Smalltalk
      to the Microsoft CLR; he had high hopes for the way Microsoft
      .NET was panning out. Jonathan Bachrach, one of the AI Labs
      researchers gave a clever talk, which I missed due to
      being out in the corridors debating the finer points of
      threading and continuations with a Scheme hacker. I returned to
      see him explain a efficient but highly difficult to follow
      method of determining whether two classes are the same; he also
      said that his language compiles down to C and the C compiler is
      executed on the fly, since it's faster to call GCC than to start
      up your own virtual machine. Paul Graham rounded off the talks
      by talking about his new dialect of Lisp, which he called
      Arc. Arc is designed to be a language for "good programmers"
      only, and gets away without taking the shortcuts and safeguards
      that you need if you're trying to be accessible. His
      presentation was very entertaining, and I have high hopes for
      his little language.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I've indicated, the interest of the workshop was as much what
      was going on outside the talks as well; Dan and I got to meet a
      load of interesting and clever people, and it was
      challenging for us to discuss our ideas with them - especially
      since we didn't always see eye to eye with our academic
      counterparts. Sadly, few people seemed to have heard much about
      <A HREF="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, something they
      will probably come to regret in time. Dan seemed to have picked
      up a few more interesting technical tips, such as a way to
      collect reference count loops without walking all of the objects
      in a heap. Oh, and we found that you should pour liquid
      nitrogen into containers first rather than trying to make
      ice cream by directly pouring it into a mix of milk and
      butter. And that the ice-cream so produced is exceptionally tasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seriously, what did we learn? I think we learned that many problems that we're facing in terms of Perl implementation
      right now have already been thoroughly researched and dealt with
      as many as 30 years ago; but we also learned that if we want to
      get at this research, then we need to do a lot of digging. The
      academic community is good at solving tricky problems like
      threading, continuations, despatch and the like, but not very
      interested in working out all the implications. To bring an
      academic success to commercial fruition requires one, as Olin
      Shivers puts it, "to become Larry Wall for a year" - to take
      care of all the gritty implementation details, and that's not
      the sort of thing that gets a PhD.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So the impetus is on us as serious language implementors to take
      the time to look into and understand the current state of the
      art in VM research to avoid re-inventing the wheel. Conferences
      such as LL1, and the mailing list that has been established as a
      result of it, are a useful way for us to find out what's
      going on and exchange experience with the academic community,
      and I look forward intently to the next one!

The Perl programming language is popular with biologists because of its practicality. In my book, 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/begperlbio/">Beginning Perl for 
Bioinformatics</a>, I demonstrate how many of the things 
biologists want to write programs for are readily--even enjoyably--accomplished with Perl.</p>

<p>My book teaches biologists how to program in Perl, even
if they have never programmed before. This article will use Perl at the level found in the middle-to-late chapters in my book, after some of the basics have been learned. However, this article can be read by biologists who do not (yet) know any programming. They should be able
to skim the program code in this article, only reading the comments, to get a general feel for how Perl is used in practical applications, using real biological data. </p>

<p>
Biological data on computers tends to be either in structured ASCII flat files--that is to say, in plain-text files--or in relational databases. Both of these data sources are easy to handle with Perl programs. For this article, I will discuss one of the flat-file data sources, 
the <a href="http://ca.expasy.org/prosite/" target="new">Prosite database</a>, which contains valuable biological information about protein domains. I will demonstrate how to use Perl to extract and use the protein domain information. In <i>Beginning Perl for 
Bioinformatics</i> I also show how to work with several other similar data sources, including GenBank (Genetic Data Bank), PDB (Protein
DataBank), BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)
output files, and REBASE (Restriction Enzyme Database).</p>

<h3>What is Prosite?</h3>



<p>
Prosite stands for "A Dictionary of Protein Sites and Patterns." To learn more about the fascinating biology behind Prosite, visit the 
<a href="http://ca.expasy.org/cgi-bin/lists?prosuser.txt">Prosite User Manual</a>. Here's an introductory description of Prosite from the user manual:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>"Prosite is a method of determining what is the function of uncharacterized proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences. It consists of a database of biologically significant sites and patterns formulated in such a way  that with  appropriate  computational  tools  it  can  rapidly  and reliably identify  to which known family of protein (if any) the new sequence belongs."</p>

<p>In some cases, the sequence of an unknown protein is too distantly related to any protein of known structure to detect its resemblance by overall sequence alignment. However, it can be identified by the occurrence in its sequence of a particular cluster of residue types, variously known as a pattern, a motif, a signature, or a fingerprint. These motifs arise because of particular requirements on the structure of specific regions of a protein, which may be important, for example, for their binding properties, or for their enzymatic activity.</p>
</blockquote>



Prosite is available as a set of plain-text files that provide the data, plus documentation. The <a href="http://www.expasy.ch/prosite">Prosite home 
page</a> provides a user interface that allows you to query the database and 
examine the documentation. The database can also be obtained for local installation from the 
<a href="ftp://www.expasy.ch/databases/prosite">Prosite ftp 
site</a>. Its use is free of charge for noncommercial users. </p>

<p>
There is some fascinating and important biology involved here; and in the programs that
follow there are interesting and useful Perl programming techniques.  See the Prosite
User Manual for the biology background, and <i>Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics</i> for the
programming background.  Or just keep reading to get a taste for what is possible when
you combine programming skills with biological data.</p>

<h3>Prosite Data</h3>

<p>
The Prosite data can be downloaded to your computer. It is in the ASCII flat file called 
<a href="ftp://ca.expasy.org/databases/prosite/release_with_updates/prosite.dat">prosite.dat</a> and is more than 4MB in size. A small version of this file created for this article, called <i>prosmall.dat</i>, is available 
<a href="http://perl.com/2001/11/16/examples/prosmall.dat">here</a>. This version of the data has just the first few records from the complete file, making it easier for you to download and test, and it's the file that we'll use in the code discussed later in this article. </p>

<p>
Prosite also provides an accompanying data file, 
<a href="ftp://ca.expasy.org/databases/prosite/release_with_updates/prosite.doc">prosite.doc</a>, which contains documentation for all the 
records in <i>prosite.dat</i>. Though we will not use it for this article, I 
do recommend you look at it and think about how to use the information along with the code presented here if you plan on doing more with Prosite.</p>

The Prosite data in <a 
href="ftp://ca.expasy.org/databases/prosite/release_with_updates/prosite.dat" 
target="new">prosite.dat</a> (or our much smaller test file <i>prosmall.dat</i>) is organized in "records," each 
of which consists of several lines, and which always include an ID line and a 
termination line containing "//". The Prosite lines all begin with a 
two-character code that specifies the kind of data that appears on that line. 
Here's a breakdown of all the possible line types that a record may contain from the 
<a href="http://ca.expasy.org/cgi-bin/lists?prosuser.txt" 
target="new">Prosite User Manual</a>: </p>

<em>
<dl>
<dt>ID</dt><dd>Identification (Begins each entry; one per entry)</dd>
<dt>AC</dt><dd>Accession number (one per entry)</dd>
<dt>DT</dt><dd>Date (one per entry)</dd>
<dt>DE</dt><dd>Short description (one per entry)</dd>
<dt>PA</dt><dd>Pattern (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>MA</dt><dd>Matrix/profile (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>RU</dt><dd>Rule (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>NR</dt><dd>Numerical results (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>CC</dt><dd>Comments (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>DR</dt><dd>Cross references to SWISS-PROT (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>3D</dt><dd>Cross references to PDB (>=0 per entry)</dd>
<dt>DO</dt><dd>Pointer to the documentation file (one per entry)</dd>
<dt>//</dt><dd>Termination line (Ends each entry; one per entry)</dd>
</dl>
</em>

<p>
Each of these line types has certain kinds of information that are formatted in a specific manner, as is detailed in the Prosite documentation.
</p>

<h3>Prosite Patterns</h3>

<p>
Let's look specifically at the Prosite patterns. These are presented in a 
kind of mini-language that describes a set of short stretches of protein that 
may be a region of known biological activity. Here's the description of the 
pattern "language" from the <a 
href="http://ca.expasy.org/cgi-bin/lists?prosuser.txt">Prosite User 
Manual</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The PA (PAttern) lines contains the definition of a Prosite pattern. The 
patterns are described using the following conventions: </p>	

<ul>
<li>The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.</li>

<li>The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is 
accepted.</li>

<li>Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids for a
given position, between square parentheses `[  ]'. For example: [ALT]
stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.</li>

<li>Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
brackets `{  }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given position. 
For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala and Met.</li>

<li>Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'.</li>

<li>Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by following
that element  with a numerical value or a numerical range between 
parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4) corresponds to
x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.</li>

<li>When a pattern is restricted to either the  N- or C-terminal of a 
sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or respectively
ends with a `>' symbol.</li>

<li>A period ends the pattern.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>Perl Subroutine to Translate Prosite Patterns into Perl Regular 
Expressions</h4>

<p>
In order to use this pattern data in our Perl program, we need to translate 
the Prosite patterns into Perl regular expressions, which are the main way 
that you search for patterns in data in Perl. 
For the sake of this article I will assume that you know the basic regular 
expression syntax. (If not, just read the program comments, and skip the Perl 
regular expressions.) As an example of what the following subroutine does, 
it will translate the Prosite pattern <code>[AC]-x-V-x(4)-{ED}.</code> into the 
equivalent Perl regular expression <code>[AC].V.{4}[^ED]</code> </p> 


<p>
Here, then, is our first Perl code, the subroutine <code>PROSITE_2_regexp</code>, to 
translate the Prosite patterns to Perl regular expressions: </p>

<p>
<pre>
<code>
#
# Calculate a Perl regular expression
#  from a PROSITE pattern
#
sub PROSITE_2_regexp {

  #
  # Collect the PROSITE pattern
  #
  my($pattern) = @_;

  #
  # Copy the pattern to a regular expression
  #
  my $regexp = $pattern;

  #
  # Now start translating the pattern to an
  #  equivalent regular expression
  #

  #
  # Remove the period at the end of the pattern
  #
  $regexp =~ s/.$//;

  #
  # Replace 'x' with a dot '.'
  #
  $regexp =~ s/x/./g;

  #
  # Leave an ambiguity such as '[ALT]' as is.
  #   However, there are two patterns [G>] that need
  #   special treatment (and the PROSITE documentation
  #   is a bit vague, perhaps).
  #
  $regexp =~ s/\[G\>\]/(G|\$)/;
  
  #
  # Ambiguities such as {AM} translate to [^AM].
  #
  $regexp =~ s/{([A-Z]+)}/[^$1]/g;

  #
  # Remove the '-' between elements in a pattern
  #
  $regexp =~ s/-//g;

  #
  # Repetitions such as x(3) translate as x{3}
  #
  $regexp =~ s/\((\d+)\)/{$1}/g;

  #
  # Repetitions such as x(2,4) translate as x{2,4}
  #
  $regexp =~ s/\((\d+,\d+)\)/{$1}/g;

  #
  # '<' becomes '^' for "beginning of sequence"
  #
  $regexp =~ s/\&lt;/^/;

  #
  # '>' becomes '$' for "end of sequence"
  #
  $regexp =~ s/\&gt;/\$/;

  #
  # Return the regular expression
  #
  return $regexp;
}
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Subroutine <code>PROSITE_2_regexp</code> takes the Prosite pattern and translates 
its parts step by step into the equivalent Perl regular expression, as 
explained in the comments for the subroutine. If you do not know Perl regular 
expression syntax at this point, just read the comments--that is, the lines 
that start with the # character. That will give you the general idea of the 
subroutine, even if you don't know any Perl at all. </p>

<h4>Perl Subroutine to Parse Prosite Records into Their Line Types</h4>

<p>
The other task we need to accomplish is to parse the various types of lines, so that, for 
instance, we can get the ID and the PA pattern lines easily. The next 
subroutine accomplishes this task: given a Prosite record, it returns a 
hash with the lines of each type indexed by a key that is the 
two-character "line type". The keys we'll be interested in 
are the ID key for the line that has the identification information; and 
the PA key for the line(s) that have the pattern information. </p>

<p>
This "get_line_types" subroutine does more than we need. It makes a hash 
index on all the line types, not just the ID and PA lines that we'll 
actually use here. But that's OK. The subroutine is short and simple 
enough, and we may want to use it later to do things with some of the other types of lines in a Prosite record.</p>

<p>
By building our hash to store the lines of a record, we can extract any of the data lines from the record that we like, just by giving the line type code (such as ID for identification number). We can use this hash to 
extract two line types that will interest us here, the ID identifier line 
and the PA pattern line. Then, by translating the Prosite pattern into a 
Perl regular expression (using our first subroutine), we will be in a 
position to actually look for all the patterns in a protein sequence. In 
other words, we will have extracted the pattern information and made it 
available for use in our Perl program, so we can search for the patterns in the protein sequence. </p>

Here, then, is our second subroutine, which accepts a Prosite record, and 
returns a hash which has the lines of the record indexed by their line 
types: </p>

<pre><code>
#
# Parse a PROSITE record into "line types" hash

  # Loop through the lines of the PROSITE record
  #
  foreach my $line (@records) {

    #

<h3>Main Program</h3>

<p>
Now let's see the code at work. The following program uses the subroutines we've just
defined to read in the Prosite records one at a time from the database in the flat file
prosmall.txt.  It then separates the different kinds of lines (such as "PA" for
pattern), and translates the patterns into regular expressions, using the subroutine
PROSITE_2_regexp we already wrote.  Finally, it searches for the regular expressions
in the protein sequence, and reports the position of the matched pattern in the sequence.</p>

<pre><code>

  # in the protein sequence, and report
  #
  while ($protein =~ /$regexp/g) {
    my $position = (pos $protein) - length($&) +1;
    print "Found $id at position $position\n";
    print "   match:   $&\n";

This program is available online as the file <a 
href="http://perl.com/2001/11/16/examples/parse_prosite">parse_prosite</a>.
The tiny example Prosite database is available as the file <a 
href="http://perl.com/2001/11/16/examples/prosmall.dat">prosmall.dat</a>. If you save these files on your 
(Unix, Linux, Macintosh, or Windows) computer, you can enter the following 
command at your command-line prompt (in the same folder in which you saved 
the two files): </p>

<pre><code>
% perl parse_prosite
</code></pre>

<p>
and it will produce the following output:
</p>

<pre><code>
Found PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE at position 22
   match:   SSR
   pattern: [ST]-x-[RK].
   regexp:  [ST].[RK]

<p>
As you see, our short program goes through the Prosite database one record at a time, parsing each record according to the types of lines within it. If the record has an ID and a pattern, it then extracts them, creates a Perl regular expression from the pattern, and finally searches in a protein sequence for the regular expression, reporting on the patterns found. </p>

<h3>The Next Step</h3>

<p>
This article has shown you how to take biological data from the Prosite 
database and use it in your own programs. With this ability, you can write programs specific to your particular research needs.</p>

<p>
Many kinds of data discovery are possible: you could combine searches for Prosite patterns with some other computation. For instance, you may want to 
also search the associated genomic DNA or cDNA for restriction sites 
surrounding a particular Prosite pattern in the translated protein, in 
preparation for cloning. </p>

<p>
While such programs are interesting in their own right, their importance in 
laboratory research really lies in the fact that their use can save enormous 
amounts of time; time which can then be used for other, less routine, tasks 
on which biological research critically depends. </p>

<p>
This article gives an example of using Perl to extract and use data from a flat file database, of which there are many in biological research. In fact, some of the most important biological databases are in flat file format, including GenBank and PDB, the primary databases for DNA sequence information and for protein structures.</p>

<p>
With the ability to write your own programs, the true power of 
bioinformatics can be applied in your lab. Learning the Perl programming language can give you a direct entry into this valuable new laboratory technique. </p>

    <p>

      Even if you haven't heard of the RSS acronym before, you're likely

      to have used RSS in the past.  Whether through the slashboxes at

      <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> or our own news summary

      at <a href="http://use.perl.org">use.perl.org</a>, the premise

      remains the same - RSS, or "Remote Site Summary" is a method used

      for providing an overview of the latest news to appear on a site.

    </p>



    <p>

      RSS is an XML-based format, where the the site's information is

      described in a format that simplifies the news down to a few key

      elements. In the example we're going to run through, we'll

      concentrate particularly on the <i>title</i> and <i>link</i> tags.

      If you're interested in specifics of RSS, you can read more

      about it and see the full specification at <a

      href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-spec-0.91.html">netscape.com</a>;

      for the purposes of this tutorial, though, I'm going to

      concentrate on how we can manipulate RSS with Perl and leave RSS

      internals alone.

    </P>

    <p>

      So, you have a news site requiring an RSS feed; or let's say

      there's a news site that you want to get into RSS

      format. O'Reilly's own <a

      href="http://meerkat.oreillynet.com">Meerkat</a> web site creates

      RSS descriptions of the news on other sites, and presents the

      latest news from all around the web as a news ticket.

      We're not going to use exactly the same method as Meerkat in

      this tutorial, but we'll use similar techniques to provide us

      with an RSS feed of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC

	News</A> web site.

    </p>

    <p>

      So, what does our perl script need to do in order to turn the

      headlines on the site into an RSS channel?  There are three main

      tasks that we'll be handling: 



      <ul> 

	<li>Downloading the page for our script to work with,</li>

	<li>Parsing the HTML on the page to give us meaningful summary

	  information, and </li>

	<li>Encoding the summary information in RSS.</li>

      </ul>

    </p>

    <p>



      For anyone who's used the huge CPAN network of modules before,

      it's not going to be a huge surprise to hear that there are

      modules to help us accomplish each of our tasks here.  We're

      going to be using <code>LWP::Simple</code> to handle downloading

      our page, <code>HTML::TokeParser</code> to parse our downloaded

      HTML into some meaningful English, and <code>XML::RSS</code> to

      create an RSS channel from our headlines and links.



    </P>



    <p>

      Let's jump in to the code.  After declaring our use of the

      modules we're going to be using...

    </p>

<pre>

use strict;

use LWP::Simple;

use HTML::TokeParser;

use XML::RSS;

</pre>



      <p>

      .. we're ready to create each of the objects we'll be using with

      each module.  Note that while <code>LWP::Simple</code> uses a

      procedural interface, both <code>HTML::TokeParser</code> and

      <code>XML::RSS</code> have Object-Oriented interfaces.  If you

      aren't used to OO in Perl, <a

      href="/pub/au/Cozens_Simon">Simon Cozens</a>'

      recent <a

      href="/pub/a/2001/11/07/ooperl.html">article</a>

      on Object-Oriented Perl might be a great help.

      </p>

<pre>

# First - LWP::Simple.  Download the page using get();.

my $content = get( "http://news.bbc.co.uk/" ) or die $!;



# Second - Create a TokeParser object, using our downloaded HTML.

my $stream = HTML::TokeParser->new( \$content ) or die $!;



# Finally - create the RSS object. 

my $rss = XML::RSS->new( version => '0.9' );

</pre>

    <p>

      Our next step in laying the foundations for our script is going

      to be to declare some variables and set the channel information

      on our RSS object.  Every RSS channel carries some metadata;

      that's to say, data which provides information about the data

      that it encodes. For instance, it usually carries at least the

      channel's name, description, and an URL link.  We're going to

      set up the metadata by calling the <code>channel</code> method

      on our object, like this:

    </p>

<pre>

# Prep the RSS.

$rss->channel(

	title        => "news.bbc.co.uk",

	link         => "http://news.bbc.co.uk/",

	description  => "news.bbc.co.uk - World News from the BBC.");



# Declare variables.

my ($tag, headline, $url);

</pre>



      <p>

	We now have all three of our modules primed and ready for use,

	and can move on to step two - obtaining plaintext information

	from our HTML page. This is where we need to apply our

	analytical skills to determine the layout of the web site

	we're looking at, and to find out how to find the headlines we

	wish to extract. The BBC's HTML layout is complex but

	predictable, and follows this routine:



      <ul>

	<li>A <CODE>&lt;div class="bodytext"&gt;</code> tag is present.</li>

	<li>An <CODE>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is opened, and then

	  closed.</LI>

	

	<li>An <CODE>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is opened, containing the

	URL we wish to grab, linking to the full text of the news

	  article.</li> 



	<li>The <CODE>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is closed, and a

	<CODE>&lt;b class="h1"&gt;</code> or <CODE>&lt;b

	class="h2"&gt;</CODE> tag is opened.</li>  



	<li>Our headline lies between this <CODE>&lt;b&gt;</code> tag

	and a <CODE>&lt;/b&gt;</code> tag.

      </ul>

      

      At first glance, it seems like acquiring the url and headline in

      this situation is going to be awkward, but

      <code>HTML::TokeParser</code> makes light work of the page.  The

      two important methods we are given by

      <code>HTML::TokeParser</code> are <code>get_tag</code> and

      <code>get_trimmed_text</code>.

    </p>



    <p>

      <code>get_tag</code> skips forward in the HTML from our current

      position to the tag specified, and <Code>get_trimmed_text</code>

      will grab plaintext from the current position to the end

      position specified.  And so we can now translate our

      description of the BBC's layout into methods upon our

      <code>HTML::TokeParser</code> object, <code>$stream</code>.

    </p>



<pre>

# First indication of a headline - A &lt;div&gt; tag is present.

while ( $tag = $stream->get_tag("div") ) {



	# Inside this loop, $tag is at a &lt;div&gt; tag.

        # But do we have a "class="bodytext">" token, too? 

	if ($tag->[1]{class} and $tag->[1]{class} eq 'bodytext') {



		# We do! 

                # The next step is an &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; set, which we aren't interested in.  

                # Let's go past it to the next &lt;a&gt;.

		$tag = $stream->get_tag('a'); $tag = $stream->get_tag('a');

		

		# Now, we're at the &lt;a&gt; with the headline in.

                # We need to put the contents of the 'href' token in $url.

		$url = $tag->[1]{href} || "--";

		

		# That's $url done.  We can move on to $headline, and &lt;b&gt;

		$tag = $stream->get_tag('b');



		# Now we can grab $headline, by using <code>get_trimmed_text</code> 

                # up to the close of the &lt;b&gt; tag.

		# We want &lt;b class="h1"&gt; or &lt;b class="h2"&gt;.  

                # A regular expression will come in useful here. 

		$headline = $stream->get_trimmed_text('/b') \ 
                 if ($tag->[1]{class} =~ /^h[12]$/); 

</pre>



      <p>



      We're getting there.  We have the page downloaded, and we're

      inside a <code>while</code> loop that's going to grab every set

      of url and headline pairs on the page.  All that's left to do is

      add <code>$url</code> and <code>$headline</code> to our RSS

      channel; but first, some tidying up..

    </p>



    <pre>

		# We need to escape ampersands, as they start entity references in XML.

		$url =~ s/&/&amp;amp;/g;

	

		# The &lt;a&gt; tags contain relative URLs - we need to qualify these.

		$url = 'http://news.bbc.co.uk'.$url;

		

		# And that's it.  We can add our pair to the RSS channel. 

		$rss->add_item( title => $headline, link => $url);

	}

}

</pre>



    <p>

      By the end of each iteration through the

      <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, our <code>$rss</code> object is

      going to contain every title and link from the page.  Now all we

      need to do is save it somewhere, and that's done with the

      <code>$rss->save</code> method.

    </p>



<pre>

$rss->save("bbcnews.rss");

</pre>



    <p>



      After executing our script, we get a '<code>bbcnews.rss</code>'

      file dumped in the current directory, and this can be processed

      by any RSS parser - for example, <a

      href="http://printf.net/evobbc.jpg">here</a>'s my current mail

      client, Evolution, adding our data to the 'Executive Summary'

      feature.

    </p>

    <p>

      If we make this accessible on the web, as all good RSS feeds

      are, we can even get at this from our Slashboxes or use.perl

      news boxes. If you do want to make it web accessible, however,

      it's probably better to periodically create the RSS file from a

      <code>cron</code> job or similar, rather than using CGI,

      especially if you think the RSS is going to be accessed more

      often than the target site will be updated.

    </p>

    <p>

      Of course, if you're creating an RSS feed for your own site, you

      have much greater control over the way you get your data. For

      instance, if you're using XML to produce your web site, you can

      use XML transformation techniques to produce RSS - but that's

      another tutorial for another time. For now, have fun, and happy

      spidering!

      I've recently started learning to play the game of Go. Go and
      Perl have many things in common -- the basic stuff of which they
      are made, the rules of the game, are relatively simple, and hide
      an amazing complexity of possibilities beneath the surface. But
      I think the most interesting thing I've found that Go and Perl
      have in common is that there are various different stages in
      your development as you learn either one. It's almost as if
      there are several different plateaus of experience, and you have
      to climb up a huge hill before getting onto the next plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, a Go player can play very simply and acquit
      himself quite decently, but to stop being a beginner and really
      get into the game, he has to learn how to attack and defend
      economically. Then, to move on to the next stage, he has to
      master fighting a repetitive sequence called a "ko." As I
      progress, I expect there to be other difficult strategies I need

      Perl, too, is not without its plateaus of knowledge, and in my
      experience, the one that really separates the beginner from the
      intermediate programmer is an understanding of object-oriented (OO) programming. Once you've understood how to use OO Perl, the door
      is opened to a huge range of interesting and useful CPAN
      modules, new programming techniques, and mastery of the upper
      plateaus of Perl programming.
    </p>
    <h3>So what is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Object-oriented programming is one of those buzzwordy
      manager-speak phrases, but unlike most of them, it actually
      means something. Let's take a look at some perfectly ordinary
      procedural Perl code, bread and butter programming to most
      beginning programmers:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
my $request = accept_request($client);
my $answer = process_request($request);
answer_request($client, $answer);
$new_request = redirect_request($client, $request, $new_url);</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      The example here is of something like a Web server: we receive a
      request from a client, process it in some way to obtain an
      answer, and send the answer to the client. Additionally, we can
      also redirect the request to a different URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same code, written in an object-oriented style, would look
      a little different:
</p>
<pre><code>
my $request = $client->accept();
$request->process();
$client->answer($request);
$new_request = $request->redirect($new_url);</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      What's going on here? What are these funny arrows? The thing to
      remember about object-oriented programming is that we're no
      longer passing the data around to subroutines, to have
      subroutines do things for us -- now, we're telling the data to do
      things for itself. You can think of the arrows,
      (<code>-></code>, formally the "method call operator") as
      instructions to the data. In the first line, we're telling the
      data that represents the client to accept a request and pass us
      something back.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this "data that represents the client," and what does
      it pass back? Well, if this is object-oriented programming, we
      can probably guess the answer: they're both objects. They look
      like ordinary Perl scalars, right? Well, that's just because
      objects really are like ordinary Perl scalars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only difference between <code>$client</code> and
      <code>$request</code> in each example is that in the
      object-oriented version, the scalars happen to know where to
      find some subroutines that they can call. (In OO speak, we call
      them "methods" instead of "subroutines.")
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why we don't have to say <code>process_request</code> in
      the OO case: if we're calling the <code>process</code> method on
      something that knows it's a request, it knows that it's
      processing a request. Simple, eh? In OO speak, we say that the
      <code>$request</code> object is in the Request "class" -- a class
      is the "type of thing" that the object is, and classes are how
      objects locate their methods. Hence,
      <code>$request->redirect</code> and <code>$mail->redirect</code>
      will call completely different methods if <code>$request</code>
      and <code>$mail</code> are in different classes; what it means
      to redirect a Request object is very different to redirecting a
      Mail object. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You might wonder what's actually going on when we call a
      method. Since we know that methods are just the OO form of
      subroutines, you shouldn't be surprised to find that methods in
      Perl really are just subroutines. What about classes? Well, the
      purpose of a class is to distinguish one set of methods from
      another. And what's a natural way to distinguish one set of
      subroutines from another in Perl? You guessed it -- in Perl,
      classes are just packages. So if we've got an object called
      <code>$request</code> in the <code>Request</code> class and we
      call the redirect method, this is what actually happens:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
# $request->redirect($new_url)

Request::redirect($request, $new_url)</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      That's right -- we just call the <code>redirect</code> subroutine
      in the appropriate package, and pass in the object along with
      any other parameters. Why do we pass in the object? So
      that <code>redirect</code> knows what object it's working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a very basic level, this is all OO Perl is -- it's another
      syntax for writing subroutine calls so that it looks like you're
      performing actions on some data. At that, for most users of OO
      Perl modules, is as much as you need to know.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is it a win?</h3>
    <p>
      So if that's all it is, why does everyone think that OO Perl is
      the best thing since sliced bread? You'll certainly find that a
      whole host of interesting and useful modules out there depend on
      OO techniques. To understand what everyone sees in it, let's go
      back to procedural code for a moment. Here's something that
      extracts the sender and subject of a mail message:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
sub mail_subject {
    my $mail = shift;
    my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
    for (@lines) {
        return $1 if /^Subject: (.*)/;
        return if /^$/; # Blank line ends headers
    }
}
sub mail_sender {
    my $mail = shift;
    my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
    for (@lines) {
        return $1 if /^From: (.*)/;
        return if /^$/;
    }
}

my $subject = mail_subject($mail);
my $from    = mail_sender($mail);</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      All well and good, but notice that we have to run through the
      whole mail each time we want to get new information about
      it. Now, it's true we could replace the body of these two
      subroutines with quite a complicated regular expression, but
      that's not the point: we're still doing more work than we ought
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our equivalent OO example, let's use the CPAN module
      <code>Mail::Header</code>. This takes a reference to an array
      of lines, and spits out a mail header object to which we can then do
      things.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
my $header = Mail::Header->new(\@lines);

my $subject = $header->get("subject");
my $from    = $header->get("from");</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Not only are we now looking at the problem from a perspective of
      "doing things to the header", we're also giving the module an
      opportunity to make this more efficient. How come?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the main benefits of CPAN modules is that they give us a
      set of functions we can call, and we don't have to care how
      they're implemented. OO programming calls this "abstraction" -
      the implementation is abstracted from the user's
      perspective. Similarly, we don't have to care what
      <code>$mail_obj</code> really is. It could just be our reference
      to an array of lines, but on the other hand,
      <code>Mail::Header</code> can do clever things with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, <code>$header</code> is a hash reference under the
      hood. Again, we don't need to care whether or not it's a hash
      reference or an array reference or something altogether
      different, but as it's a hash reference, this allows the
      constructor, <code>new</code> (a constructor is just a method
      that creates a new object) to do all the pre-processing on
      our array of lines once and for all, and then store the subject,
      sender, and all sorts of other fields into some hash keys. All
      that <code>get</code> does, essentially, is retrieve the
      appropriate value from the hash. This is obviously vastly more
      efficient than running through the whole message each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what an object really is: it's something that the module
      can rearrange and use any representation of your data that it
      likes so that it's most efficient to operate on in the
      future. You, as an end user, get the benefits of a smart
      implementation (assuming, of course, that the person who wrote
      the module is smart...) and you don't need to care about, or
      even actually see, see what's going on underneath.
    </p>












    <h3>Using it</h3>
    <p>
      We've seen a simple use of OO techniques by using
      <code>Mail::Header</code>. Let's now look at a slightly more
      involved program, to solidify our knowledge. This is a very
      simple system information server for a Unix machine. (Don't be put
      off -- these programs will work on non-Unix systems as well.) Unix has a
      client/server protocol called "finger," by which you can contact
      a server and ask for information about its users. I run "finger"
      on my username at a local machine, and get:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
% finger simon
Login name: simon       (messages off)  In real life: Simon Cozens
Office: Computing S
Directory: /v0/xzdg/simon               Shell: /usr/local/bin/bash

On since Nov  6 12:28:08
   on pts/197 from riot-act.somewhere
Project: Hacking Perl for Sugalski
Plan:

Insert amusing anecdote here.</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      What we're going to do is write our own finger client and a
      server which dishes out information about the current system,
      and we're going to do this using the object-oriented
      <code>IO::Socket</code> module. Of course, we could do this
      completely procedurally, using <code>Socket.pm</code>, but it's
      actually comparatively much easier to do it this way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the client. The finger protocol, as much as we need to
      care about it, is really simple. The client connects and sends a
      line of text -- generally, a username. The server sends back some
      text, and then closes the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using <code>IO::Socket</code> to manage the connection, we
      can come up with something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use IO::Socket::INET;

my ($host, $username) = @ARGV;

my $socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(
                        PeerAddr => $host,
                        PeerPort => "finger"
                      ) or die $!;

$socket->print($username."\n");

while ($_ = $socket->getline) {
    print;
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This is pretty straightforward: the
      <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> constructor <code>new</code>
      gives us an object representing the connection to peer address
      <code>$host</code> on port <code>finger</code>. We can then call
      the <code>print</code> and <code>getline</code> methods to send
      and receive data from the connection.  Compare this with the
      non-OO equivalent, and you may realize why people prefer dealing
      with objects:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Socket;
my ($remote,$port, $iaddr, $paddr, $proto, $user);

($remote, $user) = @ARGV; 

$port    = getservbyname('finger', 'tcp')   || die "no port";
$iaddr   = inet_aton($remote)               || die "no host: $remote";
$paddr   = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);

$proto   = getprotobyname('tcp');
socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)  || die "socket: $!";
connect(SOCK, $paddr)                       || die "connect: $!";
print SOCK "$user\n";
while (&lt;SOCK&gt;)) {
   print;
}

close (SOCK)            || die "close: $!";</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, to turn to the server. We'll also use another OO module,
      <code>Net::hostent</code>, which allows us to treat the result
      of <code>gethostbyaddr</code> as an object, rather than as a
      list of values. This means we don't have to worry about
      remembering which element of the list means what we want.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use IO::Socket;
use Net::hostent;

my $server = IO::Socket::INET->new( Proto     => 'tcp',
                                    LocalPort => 'finger',
                                    Listen    => SOMAXCONN,
                                    Reuse     => 1);
die "can't setup server" unless $server;

while ($client = $server->accept()) {
  $client->autoflush(1);
  $hostinfo = gethostbyaddr($client->peeraddr);
  printf "[Connect from %s]\n", $hostinfo->name || $client->peerhost;
  my $command = client->getline();
  if    ($command =~ /^uptime/) { $client->print(`uptime`); }
  elsif ($command =~ /^date/)   { $client->print(scalar localtime, "\n"); }
  else  { $client->print("Unknown command\n");
  $client->close;
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This is chock-full of OO Perl goodness -- a method call on nearly
      every line. We start in a very similar way to how we wrote the
      client: using <code>IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new</code> as a constructor.
      Did you notice anything strange about this?
      <codE>IO::Socket::INET</code> is a package name, which means it
      must be a class, rather than an object. But we can still call
      methods on classes (they're generally called "class methods," for
      obvious reasons) and this is how most objects actually get
      instantiated: the class provides a method called <code>new</code>
      that produces an object for us to manipulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big <code>while</code> loop calls the <code>accept</code>
      method that waits until a client connects and, when one does,
      returns another <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> object
      representing the connection to the client. We can call the
      client's <code>autoflush</code> method, which is the equivalent
      to setting <code>$|</code> for its handle; the
      <code>peeraddr</code> method returns the address of the client,
      which we can feed to <code>gethostbyaddr</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we mentioned earlier, this isn't the usual Perl
      <code>gethostbyadd</code>, but one provided by
      <code>Net::Hostent</code>, and it returns yet another object!
      We use the <code>name</code> method from this object, which
      represents information about a given host, to find the host's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest isn't anything new. If you think back to our client, it
      sent a line and awaited a response -- so our server has to read a
      line, and send a response. You get bonus points for adding more
      possible responses to our server.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      So there we are. We've seen a couple of examples of using
      object-oriented modules. It wasn't that bad, was it? Hopefully
      now you'll be well-enough equipped to be able to start using
      some of the many OO modules on CPAN for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, on the other hand, you feel you need a little more in-depth
      coverage of OO Perl, you could take a look at the "perlboot,"
      "perltoot," and "perltootc" pages in the Perl documentation. <i>The
      Perl Cookbook</i>, an invaluable book for any serious Perl
      programmer, has a very comprehensive and easy to follow
      treatment of OO techniques. Finally, the most in-depth treatment
      of all can be found in Damian Conway's "Object-Oriented Perl",
      which will see you through from a complete beginner way up to
      Perl 4 or 5 dan...
