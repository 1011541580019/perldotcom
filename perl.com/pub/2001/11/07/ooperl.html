    <p>
      I've recently started learning to play the game of Go. Go and
      Perl have many things in common -- the basic stuff of which they
      are made, the rules of the game, are relatively simple, and hide
      an amazing complexity of possibilities beneath the surface. But
      I think the most interesting thing I've found that Go and Perl
      have in common is that there are various different stages in
      your development as you learn either one. It's almost as if
      there are several different plateaus of experience, and you have
      to climb up a huge hill before getting onto the next plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, a Go player can play very simply and acquit
      himself quite decently, but to stop being a beginner and really
      get into the game, he has to learn how to attack and defend
      economically. Then, to move on to the next stage, he has to
      master fighting a repetitive sequence called a "ko." As I
      progress, I expect there to be other difficult strategies I need
      to master before I can become a better player.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perl, too, is not without its plateaus of knowledge, and in my
      experience, the one that really separates the beginner from the
      intermediate programmer is an understanding of object-oriented (OO) programming. Once you've understood how to use OO Perl, the door
      is opened to a huge range of interesting and useful CPAN
      modules, new programming techniques, and mastery of the upper
      plateaus of Perl programming.
    </p>
    <h3>So what is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Object-oriented programming is one of those buzzwordy
      manager-speak phrases, but unlike most of them, it actually
      means something. Let's take a look at some perfectly ordinary
      procedural Perl code, bread and butter programming to most
      beginning programmers:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
my $request = accept_request($client);
my $answer = process_request($request);
answer_request($client, $answer);
$new_request = redirect_request($client, $request, $new_url);</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      The example here is of something like a Web server: we receive a
      request from a client, process it in some way to obtain an
      answer, and send the answer to the client. Additionally, we can
      also redirect the request to a different URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same code, written in an object-oriented style, would look
      a little different:
</p>
<pre><code>
my $request = $client->accept();
$request->process();
$client->answer($request);
$new_request = $request->redirect($new_url);</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      What's going on here? What are these funny arrows? The thing to
      remember about object-oriented programming is that we're no
      longer passing the data around to subroutines, to have
      subroutines do things for us -- now, we're telling the data to do
      things for itself. You can think of the arrows,
      (<code>-></code>, formally the "method call operator") as
      instructions to the data. In the first line, we're telling the
      data that represents the client to accept a request and pass us
      something back.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this "data that represents the client," and what does
      it pass back? Well, if this is object-oriented programming, we
      can probably guess the answer: they're both objects. They look
      like ordinary Perl scalars, right? Well, that's just because
      objects really are like ordinary Perl scalars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only difference between <code>$client</code> and
      <code>$request</code> in each example is that in the
      object-oriented version, the scalars happen to know where to
      find some subroutines that they can call. (In OO speak, we call
      them "methods" instead of "subroutines.")
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why we don't have to say <code>process_request</code> in
      the OO case: if we're calling the <code>process</code> method on
      something that knows it's a request, it knows that it's
      processing a request. Simple, eh? In OO speak, we say that the
      <code>$request</code> object is in the Request "class" -- a class
      is the "type of thing" that the object is, and classes are how
      objects locate their methods. Hence,
      <code>$request->redirect</code> and <code>$mail->redirect</code>
      will call completely different methods if <code>$request</code>
      and <code>$mail</code> are in different classes; what it means
      to redirect a Request object is very different to redirecting a
      Mail object. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You might wonder what's actually going on when we call a
      method. Since we know that methods are just the OO form of
      subroutines, you shouldn't be surprised to find that methods in
      Perl really are just subroutines. What about classes? Well, the
      purpose of a class is to distinguish one set of methods from
      another. And what's a natural way to distinguish one set of
      subroutines from another in Perl? You guessed it -- in Perl,
      classes are just packages. So if we've got an object called
      <code>$request</code> in the <code>Request</code> class and we
      call the redirect method, this is what actually happens:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
# $request->redirect($new_url)

Request::redirect($request, $new_url)</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      That's right -- we just call the <code>redirect</code> subroutine
      in the appropriate package, and pass in the object along with
      any other parameters. Why do we pass in the object? So
      that <code>redirect</code> knows what object it's working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a very basic level, this is all OO Perl is -- it's another
      syntax for writing subroutine calls so that it looks like you're
      performing actions on some data. At that, for most users of OO
      Perl modules, is as much as you need to know.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is it a win?</h3>
    <p>
      So if that's all it is, why does everyone think that OO Perl is
      the best thing since sliced bread? You'll certainly find that a
      whole host of interesting and useful modules out there depend on
      OO techniques. To understand what everyone sees in it, let's go
      back to procedural code for a moment. Here's something that
      extracts the sender and subject of a mail message:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
sub mail_subject {
    my $mail = shift;
    my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
    for (@lines) {
        return $1 if /^Subject: (.*)/;
        return if /^$/; # Blank line ends headers
    }
}
sub mail_sender {
    my $mail = shift;
    my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
    for (@lines) {
        return $1 if /^From: (.*)/;
        return if /^$/;
    }
}

my $subject = mail_subject($mail);
my $from    = mail_sender($mail);</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      All well and good, but notice that we have to run through the
      whole mail each time we want to get new information about
      it. Now, it's true we could replace the body of these two
      subroutines with quite a complicated regular expression, but
      that's not the point: we're still doing more work than we ought
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our equivalent OO example, let's use the CPAN module
      <code>Mail::Header</code>. This takes a reference to an array
      of lines, and spits out a mail header object to which we can then do
      things.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
my @lines = split /\n/, $mail;
my $header = Mail::Header->new(\@lines);

my $subject = $header->get("subject");
my $from    = $header->get("from");</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Not only are we now looking at the problem from a perspective of
      "doing things to the header", we're also giving the module an
      opportunity to make this more efficient. How come?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the main benefits of CPAN modules is that they give us a
      set of functions we can call, and we don't have to care how
      they're implemented. OO programming calls this "abstraction" -
      the implementation is abstracted from the user's
      perspective. Similarly, we don't have to care what
      <code>$mail_obj</code> really is. It could just be our reference
      to an array of lines, but on the other hand,
      <code>Mail::Header</code> can do clever things with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, <code>$header</code> is a hash reference under the
      hood. Again, we don't need to care whether or not it's a hash
      reference or an array reference or something altogether
      different, but as it's a hash reference, this allows the
      constructor, <code>new</code> (a constructor is just a method
      that creates a new object) to do all the pre-processing on
      our array of lines once and for all, and then store the subject,
      sender, and all sorts of other fields into some hash keys. All
      that <code>get</code> does, essentially, is retrieve the
      appropriate value from the hash. This is obviously vastly more
      efficient than running through the whole message each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what an object really is: it's something that the module
      can rearrange and use any representation of your data that it
      likes so that it's most efficient to operate on in the
      future. You, as an end user, get the benefits of a smart
      implementation (assuming, of course, that the person who wrote
      the module is smart...) and you don't need to care about, or
      even actually see, see what's going on underneath.
    </p>












    <h3>Using it</h3>
    <p>
      We've seen a simple use of OO techniques by using
      <code>Mail::Header</code>. Let's now look at a slightly more
      involved program, to solidify our knowledge. This is a very
      simple system information server for a Unix machine. (Don't be put
      off -- these programs will work on non-Unix systems as well.) Unix has a
      client/server protocol called "finger," by which you can contact
      a server and ask for information about its users. I run "finger"
      on my username at a local machine, and get:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
% finger simon
Login name: simon       (messages off)  In real life: Simon Cozens

   on pts/197 from riot-act.somewhere
Project: Hacking Perl for Sugalski
Plan:

Insert amusing anecdote here.</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      What we're going to do is write our own finger client and a
      server which dishes out information about the current system,
      and we're going to do this using the object-oriented
      <code>IO::Socket</code> module. Of course, we could do this
      completely procedurally, using <code>Socket.pm</code>, but it's
      actually comparatively much easier to do it this way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the client. The finger protocol, as much as we need to
      care about it, is really simple. The client connects and sends a
      line of text -- generally, a username. The server sends back some
      text, and then closes the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using <code>IO::Socket</code> to manage the connection, we
      can come up with something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use IO::Socket::INET;

my ($host, $username) = @ARGV;

my $socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(
                        PeerAddr => $host,
                        PeerPort => "finger"
                      ) or die $!;

$socket->print($username."\n");

while ($_ = $socket->getline) {
    print;
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This is pretty straightforward: the
      <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> constructor <code>new</code>
      gives us an object representing the connection to peer address
      <code>$host</code> on port <code>finger</code>. We can then call
      the <code>print</code> and <code>getline</code> methods to send
      and receive data from the connection.  Compare this with the
      non-OO equivalent, and you may realize why people prefer dealing
      with objects:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Socket;
my ($remote,$port, $iaddr, $paddr, $proto, $user);

($remote, $user) = @ARGV; 

$port    = getservbyname('finger', 'tcp')   || die "no port";
$iaddr   = inet_aton($remote)               || die "no host: $remote";
$paddr   = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);

$proto   = getprotobyname('tcp');
socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)  || die "socket: $!";
connect(SOCK, $paddr)                       || die "connect: $!";
print SOCK "$user\n";
while (&lt;SOCK&gt;)) {
   print;
}

close (SOCK)            || die "close: $!";</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, to turn to the server. We'll also use another OO module,
      <code>Net::hostent</code>, which allows us to treat the result
      of <code>gethostbyaddr</code> as an object, rather than as a
      list of values. This means we don't have to worry about
      remembering which element of the list means what we want.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use IO::Socket;
use Net::hostent;

my $server = IO::Socket::INET->new( Proto     => 'tcp',
                                    LocalPort => 'finger',
                                    Listen    => SOMAXCONN,
                                    Reuse     => 1);
die "can't setup server" unless $server;

while ($client = $server->accept()) {
  $client->autoflush(1);
  $hostinfo = gethostbyaddr($client->peeraddr);
  printf "[Connect from %s]\n", $hostinfo->name || $client->peerhost;
  my $command = client->getline();
  if    ($command =~ /^uptime/) { $client->print(`uptime`); }
  elsif ($command =~ /^date/)   { $client->print(scalar localtime, "\n"); }
  else  { $client->print("Unknown command\n");
  $client->close;
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This is chock-full of OO Perl goodness -- a method call on nearly
      every line. We start in a very similar way to how we wrote the
      client: using <code>IO::Socket::INET-&gt;new</code> as a constructor.
      Did you notice anything strange about this?
      <codE>IO::Socket::INET</code> is a package name, which means it
      must be a class, rather than an object. But we can still call
      methods on classes (they're generally called "class methods," for
      obvious reasons) and this is how most objects actually get
      instantiated: the class provides a method called <code>new</code>
      that produces an object for us to manipulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big <code>while</code> loop calls the <code>accept</code>
      method that waits until a client connects and, when one does,
      returns another <code>IO::Socket::INET</code> object
      representing the connection to the client. We can call the
      client's <code>autoflush</code> method, which is the equivalent
      to setting <code>$|</code> for its handle; the
      <code>peeraddr</code> method returns the address of the client,
      which we can feed to <code>gethostbyaddr</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we mentioned earlier, this isn't the usual Perl
      <code>gethostbyadd</code>, but one provided by
      <code>Net::Hostent</code>, and it returns yet another object!
      We use the <code>name</code> method from this object, which
      represents information about a given host, to find the host's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest isn't anything new. If you think back to our client, it
      sent a line and awaited a response -- so our server has to read a
      line, and send a response. You get bonus points for adding more
      possible responses to our server.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      So there we are. We've seen a couple of examples of using
      object-oriented modules. It wasn't that bad, was it? Hopefully
      now you'll be well-enough equipped to be able to start using
      some of the many OO modules on CPAN for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, on the other hand, you feel you need a little more in-depth
      coverage of OO Perl, you could take a look at the "perlboot,"
      "perltoot," and "perltootc" pages in the Perl documentation. <i>The
      Perl Cookbook</i>, an invaluable book for any serious Perl
      programmer, has a very comprehensive and easy to follow
