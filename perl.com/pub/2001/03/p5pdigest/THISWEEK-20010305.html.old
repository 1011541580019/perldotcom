<H3><a name="Locale_Support">Locale Support</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Andrew Pimlott filed a bug report related to 
<CODE>POSIX::tolower</CODE>; basically, it is not as locale-aware as Perl's own 
<CODE>lc</CODE>. He also found that 
<CODE>lc</CODE> failed to be locale-aware while in the debugger. 
<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#ING-SIMMONS">Nick Ing-Simmons</a> pointed out that 
<CODE>use locale</CODE> is lexically scoped, and the debugger is in a different scope, meaning
that it won't pick up on the pragma. Andrew thought this was probably a
bug (the debugger not assuming the debuggee's scope) but it is unclear
as to how that could be fixed. Nick wondered if the first was due to not
calling 
<CODE>setlocale</CODE>, but Andrew reported that this didn't help anything.
</P>

<P>
Andrew then went digging around in 
<CODE>POSIX.pm</CODE> and found that 
<CODE>isalpha</CODE> is perfectly locale aware, but 
<CODE>tolower</CODE> is not - this is because 
<CODE>isalpha</CODE> is written in XS, but 
<CODE>tolower</CODE> simply calls 
<CODE>lc</CODE>; because it's in a different lexical context, it doesn't pick up on
the 
<CODE>use locale</CODE>. It transpires that XS code does execute in the same lexical context as
the caller, which is quite strange. Andrew pointed out that there's no
way to make a pragma dynamically scoped. He said:
<blockquote>I think this raises some fundamental issues, but I'm not sure
exactly which.  It seems clear that one would like to be able to
write a correct tolower (ie, exactly equivalent to lc, as per the
POSIX documentation) in pure Perl.  One possibility is a TCL-like
&quot;uplevel&quot;, but I desperately hope that doesn't turn out to be the
best option.
</blockquote></P>

<P>
I asked why POSIX functions were being implemented in Perl instead of C,
and Andrew replied that in some cases it already works merely by magic:
Perl doesn't correctly turn on and off locale support lexically, so some
functions inherit the support for free. 
<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#HIETANIEMI">Jarkko</a> grumbled about locales in his customary manner, and said he'd take 
a look at the areas which needed 
<CODE>setlocale</CODE> calling, but then Andrew had a revelation:
<blockquote>Hmm, looks like I missed an essential point:  locale support is not
dependent on 'use locale' at all!  This seems to be intentional.
perl unconditionally calls setlocale() on startup, and never calls
it again (unless you use POSIX::setlocale() explictly).  So
POSIX::isalpha() respects $LANG by default, even if you never
mention the locale pragma.
</P>

<P>
It is only where (core) perl has a choice between calling a
locale-sensitive libc function, and doing things its own way (eg,
hard-coding character semantics), that the locale pragma currently
matters.  Since the string value of $! requires calling a
locale-sensitive function (strerror()), $! always respects locale.
</blockquote></P>

<P>
And you wonder why Jarkko throws his hands in the air at the mention of
anything locale-related...
<H3><a name="Coderef_INC">Coderef @INC</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#CLARK">Nicholas Clark </a> provided a patch which extended the little-known coderef-in-
<CODE>@INC</CODE> feature to allow passing an object; if you pass an object instead of a
 coderef, the 
<CODE>INC</CODE> method will be called on it. This has allowed him to create an
experimental pragma, 
<a href="http://www.flirble.org/~nick/P/ex-lib-zip-0.01.tar.gz"><CODE>ex::lib::zip</CODE></a> which lets you put a module tree inside a ZIP archive and Perl will
extract the modules it needs from it.
</P>

<P>
He then also explained what it was all about, in the hope that someone
would write some proper documentation. Nobody did so, (my fault, I
promised to but didn't get around to it) but his
extremely helpful explanation of the coderef-in-
<CODE>@INC</CODE> API, and the cheap source filter API it allows can be found
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-02/msg01780.html">here</a>.
</P>

<P>
Briefly, you can do 
</P>

</P><PRE>
    BEGIN {
        push @INC, \&somesub;
        sub somesub {
            my ($owncoderef, $wanted_file) = @_;
            # Produce a filehandle somehow
            if ($got_a_handle) {
                return *FH;
            } else {
                returm undef;
            }
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>
and have your subroutine intercept calls to 
<CODE>use</CODE>. The 
<CODE>ByteCache</CODE> module on CPAN makes use of this to cache just-in-time compiled
versions of modules.
<H3><a name="More_Memory_Leak_Hunting">More Memory Leak Hunting</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Some people started complaining about the lateness of 5.6.1, and 
<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#BURLISON">Alan</a> mentioned the he probably wouldn't be able to ship 5.6.1 in
Solaris yet because of what he saw as &quot;the large number of leaks&quot;.
<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#GURUSAMY">Sarathy </a> disagreed:
<blockquote>I strongly suspect you'll end up shipping no version of Perl with 
Solaris, then.  Every single version of Perl out there has more
unfixed &quot;leaks&quot; than 5.6.1-to-be, and some &quot;real&quot; ones to boot.
</P>

<P>
I say &quot;leaks&quot; because these are still totally hypothetical, given your
vantage point of a -DPURIFY enabled build with the arena cleanup
repressed (which is the right vantage point for someone who has set
out to clean up all leaks, I should add).  However, this is not the
real world.  In the real world, the arena cleanup is enabled and
appears to do its thing (however ugly you or I say it is).
</blockquote></P>

<P>
There was then some similarly ugly debate about what actually
constitutes a leak: Alan considered a leak anything which allocated
memory and lost the pointer to it; Sarathy was only considering
monotonic process growth. Nick Clark suggested that he could trigger
a leak in the Sarathy sense by repeatedly 
<CODE>use</CODE>ing modules and clearing out 
<CODE>%INC</CODE>, but this wasn't the case; the leak is due to some ugly fakery that
goes on when the compiler sees 
<CODE>use Module;</CODE>. Alan could, however, trigger a leak with 
</P>

</P><PRE>
    sub X { sub {} }
</PRE>

<P>
as the inner subroutine wasn't being properly reference counted.
Alan and I scrambled around looking for the 
<CODE>use</CODE> leak, and Alan found that the two were related. I'm not aware as to
whether or not he's fixed it.
</P>

<P>
In other news, Nicholas Clark is a wicked, wicked man and managed to compile the
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">Boehm Garbage Collector </a> into Perl. (As 
<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#SCHWARTZ">Randal </a> pointed out off-list, no more Boehm garbage!) and
 found a way to use it as a memory leak detector.
<H3><a name="Weird_Memory_Corruption">Weird Memory Corruption</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Weird bug of the week came from Jarkko, who found that
</P>

</P><PRE>
    $ENV{BAR} = 0;
    reset;
    if (0) {
      if ("" =~ //) {
      }
    }
</PRE>

<P>
caused all kinds of merry hell - on some platforms, it ran fine, on some
it segfaulted; the problems were not consistent across platforms,
meaning that some machines with identical setups produced differing
results. This is obviously maddening. Nick Clark made it even weirder:
<blockquote>./perl will pass.
/usr/local/bin/perl will SEGV.
They are byte for byte identical.
</blockquote></P>

<P>
Jarkko thought this was a recent problem, but Nick managed to reproduce
it in 5.005_02. Alan produced an 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-03/msg00176.html">impressive explanation</a> of what was going on, which I greatly encourage you to read if you want
to learn how to track this sort of thing down, but stopped short of an actual 
fix.
</P>

<P>
There was, of course, the usual discussion of how useless 
<CODE>reset</CODE> was anyway, including one suggestion of rewriting the op in pure Perl.
<H3><a name="Yet_More_Unicode_Wars">Yet More Unicode Wars</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

87 messages this week were spent attempting to formulate a sensible and
acceptable Unicode policy. The attempt failed. If you really want to
jump in and have a look,
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-02/msg01680.html">this</a> is as good a place to start as any.
<H3><a name="Switch_is_broken">Switch is broken</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Jarkko reported that for some reason, Switch 2.01 from CPAN has suddenly
started failing tests on bleadperl. It would be really, really, really
great if someone out there could look into why this is happening and try
to come up with an isolated bug report. Or even better, fix it.
<H3><a name="Various">Various</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Olaf Flebbe chimed in a bunch of EPOC fixes, for those of you running
Perl on your Psions; 
Sarathy fixed a long-standing parser bug.
Michael Stevens did some sterling work clearing up the POD markup of the
documentation. 
<a href="http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#BERRY">Craig Berry</a> turned in some updates to VMS's 
<CODE>configure.com</CODE>. Daniel Stutz and Ed Peschko both rewrote 
<CODE>perlcc</CODE>. 
</P>

<P>
David Mitchell deserves an honourable mention for a really useful first patch,
which lets 
<CODE>perl -Dt</CODE> tell you which variables are being accessed, as well as another debug
option, 
<CODE>-DR</CODE> which tells you the reference counts of SVs in the stack.
Very cool stuff, David, thanks.
</P>

<P>
Someone reported that 
<CODE>ExtUtils::Install</CODE> is naughty and doesn't check the return values of 
<CODE>File::Copy::copy</CODE>; this would be easy enough to fix up if anyone out there is interested.
(That's bug ID 20010227.005, by the way)
</P>

<P>
Until next week I remain, your humble and obedient servant,
</P>
