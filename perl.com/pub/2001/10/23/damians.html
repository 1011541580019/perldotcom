<p>London.pm technical meetings are always inspiring events with top
notch speakers. At our most recent gathering Richard Clamp and Mark
Fowler gave us "Wax::On, Wax::Off -- how to become a Perl sensei";
Paul Mison showed us how to make an infobot read the BBC news; Richard
Clamp and Michael Stevens explained "Pod::Coverage", their
contribution to Kwalitee assurance; and, for the first time ever, Leon
Brocard didn't talk about Graphing Perl.</p>
<p>However, the highlight of the evening was Simon Cozens's first public
demonstration of Parrot, the new virtual computer that will one
day run Perl 6.</p>
<p>After he'd finished the talk we expected, he pulled a crumpled piece
of paper from a secret pocket. This, he whispered, was an early draft
of Apocalypse 3 which he'd smuggled out at great personal risk from
under the very noses of the Design Team. An expectant hush fell as he
proceeded to reveal the highlights.</p>

<p>The reception his heroic effort received was... low key. Everyone
was pleased to get an early peek at what Larry was thinking, but there
were widespread mutterings about "all this needless complexity" and
"mere syntactic sugar". Almost everyone grumbled about the use of '<code>.</code>'
for dereferencing. Almost everyone groused about using '<code>_</code>' for
concatenation. And the reassurance that "It's only syntax" didn't seem
to appease the doubters.</p>
<p>And then we all went for beer and/or Chinese food.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last weekend. The Apocalypse was <a href="/pub/a/2001/10/02/apocalypse3.html">up on the website</a> and
Damian had just published his Exegesis when Simon Wistow (London.pm's
official scapegoat) warned the mailing list that he had:</p>
<blockquote><p>
   ... an impending sense of doom about Perl 6. The latest
   Apocalypse/Exegesis fill me with fear rather than wonder. I've got
   a horrible feeling that Perl 6 is trying to do too much at
   once.</p></blockquote>
<p>This provoked a firestorm of agreement. The general consensus was that
the latest Apocalypse was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    reinventing wheels which we already have in abundance. And those
    new wheels have syntax that is only going to confuse those who are
    already experienced perl5 users</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that what we have here is a failure to communicate.</p>
<p>Yes, Damian's efforts have been superb in providing examples of code
based on the Apocalypses, and I don't think anyone denies the sterling
work that Dan and his team are doing with Parrot. But people do seem
to be worried about Perl 6 being a rewrite for the Damians of this
world, not for the ordinary Joe.</p>
<p>Well, I'm here to tell you that this ordinary Piers doesn't have a
problem with Perl 6. In fact I'm excited and inspired by most of the
work that's been done so far, and I hope to convince you too.</p>
<h3><a name="perl6 doesn't look like perl">"Perl 6 doesn't look like Perl"</a></h3>
<p>Well, up to a point. The thing that you have to remember when reading
the sample code that Damian provides in his Exegeses is that he is
deliberately exercising all the new features in a condensed example.
The most recent code sample is initially scary because there's so
<em>much</em> stuff in Apocalypse 3. Admittedly, <code>$self.method()</code> looks
weird now, but then, <code>$self-&gt;method()</code> looked weird when Perl 5 was
introduced. And, on rereading Damian's example with an eye to what
<em>hasn't</em> changed, the whole thing still looks like Perl.</p>
<h3><a name="perl 6 just gives us syntax for stuff we can already do">"Perl 6 just gives us syntax for stuff we can already do"</a></h3>
<p>That's a mighty big 'just' there, partner. Consider the currying
syntax. Before this came along, currying was possible, but required an
unreasonable amount of manual work to implement. Just consider the
following, 'simple' example:</p>
<p>In perl 6 we have:</p>
<pre>
    $^_ + $^_</pre>
<p>In perl 5, if you didn't worry about currying you'd write:</p>
<pre>
    sub { $_[0] + $_[1] }</pre>
<p>If you <em>do</em> worry about currying, you'll have to write:</p>
<pre>
    do { 
        my $self;
        $self = sub {
            my ($arg1, $arg2) = @_;
            return $arg1 + $arg2             if @_==2;
            return sub { $self-&gt;($arg1,@_) } if @_==1;
            return $self;
        }
    }</pre>
<p>And I don't want to <em>think</em> about the hoops I'd have to jump through
in the case of a curried function with three arguments, or if I wanted
named arguments. Now, you could very well argue that you don't use
anonymous functions much anyway, so you're certainly not going to be
doing tricks with currying, and you may be right. But then, of course,
if you don't want to use them <em>you don't have to</em>.</p>
<p>However, I'm betting that before long it will be just another spanner
in your toolbox along with all the other gadgets and goodies that
Larry's shown us so far. Tools that you use without a second thought.</p>
<p>If you've ever done any academic computer science, you might have come
across Functional Programming, in which case an awful lot of what's
new in Perl 6 so far will be looking surprisingly familiar. The thing
is, until now, Functional Programming has been seen as only of concern
to academics and the kind of weirdoes who are daft enough to write
Emacs extensions and, dammit, Perl doesn't need it. There is even
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/28.html">an RFC</a> to this effect.</p>
<p>I remember saying almost exactly the same thing about another language
feature of 'purely academic interest' that got introduced with perl 5;
the closure.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but closures are old friends now; another tool
that gets pulled out and used where appropriate, with hardly a second
thought.</p>
<h3><a name="perl 6 doesn't give us anything that perl 5 doesn't.">"Perl 6 doesn't give us anything that Perl 5 doesn't."</a></h3>
<p>Yeah, and Perl 5 doesn't give us anything that a Universal Turing
Machine, Intercal, or Python don't. We use it because it 'fits our
brains'. The Perl 6 redesign is all about improving that fit.</p>









<h3><a name="apocalypse 3 is mostly mere syntactic sugar">"<a href="/pub/a/2001/10/02/apocalypse3.html">Apocalypse 3</a> is mostly mere syntactic sugar"</a></h3>
<p>You say that like it's a <em>bad</em> thing. Perl's creed has always been to
make the easy things easy and the hard things possible. In many ways,
Perl 6 is going further than that: making hard things easy. And
Apocalypse 3 continues this trend.</p>
<p>Well chosen syntactic sugar is good voodoo. It's Laziness with a
capital L, and Laziness, as we all know, is a virtue.</p>
<p>Let's look at what we get in Apocalypse 3.</p>
<h4>
<a name="item_The_hyper_operator%2E">The hyper operator.</a></h4>
<p>
Well, this is just a <code>foreach</code> loop isn't it? Yes, but as Damian
subsequently pointed out, would you rather write and maintain:
<pre>
    my @relative;
    my $end = @max &gt; @min ? @max &gt; @mean ? $#max : $#mean
                          : @min &gt; @mean ? $#min : $#mean;
    foreach my $i ( 0 .. $end ) {
        $relative[$i] = $mean[$i]) / ($max[$i] - $min[$i]);
    }</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
    my @relative = @mean ^/ (@max ^- @min);</pre>
<p>In the second case, the intent of the code is clear. In the first it's
obfuscated by the loop structure and set up code.</p>
<h4><a name="item_Chainable_file_test_ops">Chainable file test ops</a></h4>
<p>
Why hasn't it <em>always</em> worked like this? Ah yes, because the
internals of perl 5 wouldn't allow for it. This is an example of the
far reaching effects of some of the earlier Apocalypses giving us cool
stuff.
<p>Let's do the comparison again.</p>
<p>Perl 5:</p>
<pre>
    my @writable_files = grep {-f $_ &amp;&amp; -r _ &amp;&amp; -w _ &amp;&amp; -x _} @files;</pre>
<p>Perl 6:</p>
<pre>
    my @writable_files = grep { -r -w -x -f $_ } @files;</pre>
<p>Shorter and clearer. Huzzah.</p>
<h4><a name="item_Binary_%27%3B%27">Binary ';'</a></h4>
<p>
This one's a bit odd. We've not yet seen half of what's going to be
done with it, but I have the feeling that the multidimensional array
mongers are going to have a field day.
</p>
<h4><a name="item_%3D%3E_is_a_pair_builder">=&gt; is a pair builder</a></h4>
<p>Mmmm... pairs. Lisp flashbacks! Well, yes. But if hashes are to become
'bags' of pairs, then it seems that hash keys won't be restricted to
being simple strings. Which is brilliant. On more than several
occasions I've found myself wanting to do something along the
lines of
<pre>
    $hash{$object}++;</pre>
<p>and then later do</p>
<pre>
    @results = map  { $_.some_method }
               grep { $hash{$_} &gt; 1 }
                   keys %hash;</pre>
<p>Try doing that in Perl 5.</p>
<p>The use of pairs for named arguments to subroutines looks neat too,
and should avoid the tedious hash setup that goes at the top of any
subroutine that's going to accept named parameters in Perl 5.</p>
<h4><a name="item_Lazy_lists">Lazy lists</a></h4>
<p>
Lazy lists are cool, though I note that Damian couldn't squeeze a
compelling example of their usage in Exegesis 3. For some applications
they are a better mousetrap, and if you don't actually need them
they're not going to get in your way. I'm not sure if Larry has
confirmed it yet, but I do like the idea of being able to do:
<pre>
    my($first,$second,$third) = grep is_prime($_), 2 .. Inf;</pre>
<p>and have things stop when the first three primes have been found.</p>
<p>And having</p>
<pre>
    my($has_matches) = grep /.../ @big_long_list;</pre>
<p>stop at the first match would be even better.</p>
<h4><a name="item_Logical_operators_propagating_context">Logical operators propagating context</a></h4>
<p>
Where's the downside? This can only be a good thing. Multiway
comparison <code>0 &lt; $var &lt;= 10</code> is another example of unalloyed
goodness.
<p></p>
<h4><a name="item_Backtracking_operators">Backtracking operators</a></h4>
<p>
I'm not entirely sure I understand this yet. But it looks like it has
the potential to be a remarkably powerful way of programming (just
like regular expressions are, which do <em>loads</em> of backtracking). I
have the feeling that parser writers are going to love this, and
equation solvers, and...
<p>But again, if you don't need the functionality, don't use it. It'll
stay out of your way.</p>









<h4><a name="item_All_operators_get_%27proper%27_function_names%2E">All operators get 'proper' function names.</a></h4>
<p>
This one almost had me punching the air. It's brilliant. Especially
if, like me, you're the kind of person who goes slinging function
references around. (One of the things that I really like about Ruby is
its heady mix of functional style higher order functions and hard core
object orientation. It looks like Perl's getting this too.)
<p>Again, time to make with the examples. Consider the following perl
code from an Assertion package (this is in Perl 6, it's too hard to
write clearly in Perl 5).</p>
<pre>
    &amp;assert_with_comparator := {
        unless ($^comparator.($^a, $^b)) {
            throw Exception::FailedComparison :
                comparator =&gt; $^comparator,
                result     =&gt; $^a,
                target     =&gt; $^b
        }
    }</pre>
<pre>
    &amp;assert_string_equals := assert_with_comparator(&amp;operator:eq);
    &amp;assert_num_equals    := assert_with_comparator(&amp;operator:==);
    &amp;assert_greater_than  := assert_with_comparator(&amp;operator:&gt;);</pre>
<p>That's full strength Perl 6 that is, complete with currying, operators
as functions, <a href="#item_%3A%3D"><code>:=</code></a> binding, <code>:</code> used to disambiguate indirect object
syntax, the whole nine yards. And it is still obviously a Perl
program. The intent of the code is clear, even without comments, and
it took very little time to write. Of course, I am assuming an
Exception class, but we've already got that in Perl 5; take a look at
the lovely <code>Error.pm</code>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to rewrite <code>assert_with_comparator</code>, but just look at
the Perl 5 version of the last line of that example:</p>
<pre>
    *Assert::assert_greater_than =
        $assert_with_comparator-&gt;(sub { $_[0] &gt; $_[1] });</pre>
<p>Don't try and tell me that the intent is clearer in Perl 5 than in
Perl 6, because I'll be forced to laugh at you.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="item_binary_and_unary_%27%2E%27">binary and unary '.'</a></h4>
<p>
I confess that I'm still not sure I see where binary '<code>.</code>' is a win over
'<code>-&gt;</code>', especially given that Larry has mandated that most of the time
you won't even need it.
<p>Unary '<code>.</code>' is looking really cool. If I read the Apocalypse right, this
means that, instead of writing object methods like:</p>
<pre>
    sub method {
        my $self = shift;
        ...
        $self-&gt;{attribute} = $self-&gt;other_method(...);
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>We can write:</p>
<pre>
    sub method {
        ...
        $.attribute = .other_method(...);
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>Which is, once more clean, clear and perl like. This is the kind of
notation I want Right Now. And, frankly, it'd just look silly if you
replaced those '.'s with '<code>-&gt;</code>' (and should one parse
<code>$-&gt;attribute</code> as an instance variable accessor, or as <code>$- &gt;
attribute</code>). Okay, I'm convinced. Replace '<code>-&gt;</code>' with '<code>.</code>' already.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="item_Explicit_stringification_and_numification_operator">Explicit stringification and numification operators</a></h4>
<p>
Again, these have got to be good magic, especially with the <code>NaN</code> stuff
(though that's been the cause of some serious debate on perl6-language
and may not be the eventual name). In at least one of the modules I'm
involved in writing and maintaining, this would have been <em>so</em> useful:
<pre>
    # geq: Generic equals
    sub operator:geq is prec(\&amp;operator:eq($$)) ($expected, $got)
    {
        # Use numericness of $expected to determine which test to use
        if ( +$expected eq 'NaN') { return $expected eq $got }
        else                      { return $expected == $got }
    }</pre>
<pre>
    sub assert_equals ($expected, $got; $comment)
    {
        $comment //= &quot;Expected $expected, got $got&quot;;
        $expected geq $got or die $comment;
    }</pre>
<p>Hey! That looks just like Perl! (Except that, to do the same thing in
Perl 5, you have to jump through some splendidly non-obvious hoops.
Trust me, I've done that.)</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="item_%3A%3D">:=</a></h4>
<p>
This one had me scratching my head as I read the Apocalypse. On
reading the Exegesis, things become a good deal clearer. <a href="#item_%3A%3D"><code>:=</code></a> looks like
it's going to be an easy way to export symbols from a module, now that
typeglobs have gone away:
<pre>
    package Foo;
    sub import ($class, @args) {
        # This is an example, ignore the args
        &amp;{&quot;${class}::foo&quot;} := &amp;Foo::foo;
    }</pre>
<p>Of course, this isn't the only place where <a href="#item_%3A%3D"><code>:=</code></a> will be used. Thankfully
we'll be able to use it almost everywhere without having to remember
all the caveats that used to surround assigning to typeglobs. Here's
another example in Perl 6 of something that would be impossible in
Perl 5:</p>
<pre>
    $Sunnydale{ScoobyGang}{Willow}{Traits} = [qw/cute geeky/];</pre>
<pre>
    # Oooh Seasons 4 and 5 happened and I want
    # to use a trait object now</pre>
<pre>
    $traits := $Sunnydale{ScoobyGang}{Willow}{Traits};
    $traits = new TraitCollection: qw/sexy witch lesbian geek/;</pre>
<p>Nothing special there you say. Well, yes, but let's take a look at</p>
<pre>
    print $Sunnydale{ScoobyGang}{Willow}{Traits}
    # sexy witch lesbian geek
    # Or however a TraitCollection stringifies.</pre>
<p>You can <em>almost</em> do this in Perl 5, but only if you continue to use
an array:</p>
<pre>
    local *traits = $Sunnydale{ScoobyGang}{Willow}{Traits};
    @traits = qw/sexy witch lesbian geek/;</pre>
<p>If you want to switch to using a <code>TraitCollection</code>, you'll have to go
back and use the full specifier.</p>
<p>I think this is another of those bits of syntax that I'd like now,
please.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><a name="item_Binary_%3A">Binary :</a></h4>
<p>
This is going to make life so much easier for the parser if nothing
else. Right now, indirect object syntax can be very useful. However,
if you've ever tried to use it in anger, well, you've ended up using
it in anger because there are some subtle gotchas that will catch you
out. Binary : lets us disambiguate many of these cases and helps to
reclaim indirect object syntax as a useful way of working.
</p>
<p>And so on... What's not to like? The sugar is sweet, the consistency
is just right, and the old annoyances are going away.</p>









<h3><a name="perl 6 inspires fear.">"Perl 6 inspires fear."</a></h3>
<p>Well, maybe. But it also just flat out inspires. If you don't believe
me, take a look at the response to Perl 6 on CPAN. Damian's
<code>Attribute::Handlers</code> successfully attempts to graft some of Perl 6's
ease of manipulation of attributes back into Perl 5, and does a
remarkably good job of it. Just look at all the really cool new
modules that have sprung up around it. And that's just a small part of
what we're going to get with Perl 6.</p>
<p>There are many new modules that exist only to 'mutate' perl5 behaviour
-- <code>NEXT</code>, <code>Hook::LexWrap</code>, <code>Aspect</code>, <code>Switch</code>, <code>Coro</code> etc. I would argue that
many of these have arisen in response to discussions about making Perl
6 a far more mutable language than Perl 5. And, if nothing else, these
modules have gone some way to demonstrating that even now, Perl is
more flexible than we ever realised.</p>
<h3><a name="perl 6 is taking too long">Perl 6 is taking too long</a></h3>
<p>I'm not quoting anyone else here; that's me complaining. I want it all
and I want it now! But I also want a well thought out and coherent
design. The choice between doing it Right and doing it Now is not a
choice. Doing it Right is imperative.</p>
<p>The changes that Larry is making to the language will have far
reaching and probably unforeseen consequences. But that's no reason
for shying away from them. I've been programming in Perl for long
enough to remember the transition from Perl 4 to Perl 5, and I
remember delaying my own move to perl 5 for an embarrassingly long
time. I didn't understand the new stuff in 5 and I hadn't a clue why
anyone would want it, so I put off the move.</p>
<p>Eventually, I held my nose and jumped in. References were so cool. The
new, 'real', data structures meant an end to contortions like:</p>
<pre>
    $hash{key} = join &quot;\0&quot;, @list;</pre>
<pre>
    # and later...</pre>
<pre>
    @list = split /\0/, $hash{key};</pre>
<p>Within a remarkably short space of time almost everything that had
confused and scared me became almost second nature. Stuff that had
been a complete pain in Perl 4 was a breeze Perl 5 (who remembers
Oraperl now?) It seemed that all you had to remember was to change
<code>&quot;pdcawley@bofh.org.uk&quot;</code> to <code>&quot;pdcawley\@bofh.org.uk&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>The same thing is going to happen with Perl 6. Even if it doesn't, all
those perl 5 binaries aren't going to disappear from the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>What I'm most looking forward to are the gains we're going to see from
Perl becoming easier to parse. Over in the Smalltalk world they have
this almost magical thing called the 'Refactoring Browser' which is a
very smart tool for messing with your source code. Imagine being able
highlight a section of your code, then telling the browser to 'extract
method'.</p>
<p>The browser then goes away, works out what parameters the new method
will need, creates a brand new method which does the same thing as the
selected code and replaces the selected section with a method call.</p>
<p>This is Deep Magic. Right now it's an almost impossible trick to pull
off in Perl, because the only thing that knows how to parse Perl is
perl. It is my fond hope that, once we get Perl 6, it's going to be
possible to implement a Perl refactoring browser, and my work with
ugly old code bases will become far, far easier.</p>
<p>But even if that particular magic wand never appears, Perl 6 is still
going to give us new and powerful ways to do things, some of which
we'd never even have tried to do before. Internally it's going to be
fast and clean, and we're going to get real Garbage Collection at
last. If Parrot fulfils its early promise, we may well see Perl users
taking advantages of extensions written in Ruby, or Python, or
Smalltalk. World peace will ensue! The lion will lay down with the
lamb, and the camel shall abide with the serpent! Cats and dogs living
together! Ahem.</p>

<p>It's been a long strange trip from perl 1.0 to where we are today.
Decisions have been taken that made sense at the time, which today see
us lost in a twisty little maze of backward compatibility (or should
that be a little twisty maze...). Anyone who looks at the source code
for Perl 5 will tell you it's scary, overly complex, and a complete
nightmare to maintain. And that's if they understand it.</p>
<p>Perl 6 is our chance to learn from Perl 5, but Perl 6 is also going to
be Perl remade. If everything goes to plan (and I see no reason why it
won't) we will arrive at Perl 6 with the crud jettisoned and the good
stuff improved. We'll be driven by a gleaming, modern engine
unfettered by the limitations of the old one. We'll have a shiny new
syntax that builds on the best traditions of the old to give us
something that is both brand new and comfortingly familiar.</p>
<p>And there, in the Captain's chair, you'll still find Larry, smiling
his quiet smile, comfortable in the knowledge that, even if he doesn't
know exactly where we're going, it'll be a lot of fun finding out.
Over there, at the science officer's station, Damian is doing strange
things with source filters, haikus and Quantum. A calm voice comes up
from engineering; it's Dan, telling us that the new engines <em>can</em>
take it. And at the helm Nat Torkington gently steers Perl 6 on her
continuing mission towards new code and new implementations.</p>
<p>And Ensign Cawley? Well... there's a strange alien device called a
refactoring browser. I'm going to be replicating one for Perl.</p>
