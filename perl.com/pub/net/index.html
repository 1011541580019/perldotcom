      No, I haven't sold out; I haven't gone over to the dark side; I
      haven't been bought. I'm one of the last people to be using
      closed-source software by choice. But one of the traits of any
      self-respecting hacker is curiosity, and so when he hears about
      some cool new technology, he's almost obliged to check it out
      and see whether there's anything he can learn from it. So this
      particular Perl hacker took a look at Microsoft's .NET
      Framework, and, well, Mikey, I think he likes it.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is .NET?</h3>

    <p>
      When something's as incredibly hyped as Microsoft's .NET
      project, it's hard to convince people that there's a real
      working technology underneath it. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn't
      do itself any favors by slapping the .NET moniker on
      anything they can. So let's clarify what we're
      talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      .NET is applied to anything with the broad notion of "Web
      services" -- from the Passport and Hailstorm automated
      privacy-deprivation services and the Web-service-enabled versions
      of operating systems and application products to the C#
      language and the Common Language Runtime. But there is an underlying theme and it goes like this: The .NET <b>Framework</b> is an environment based on
      the Common Language Runtime and (to some extent) the C#
      language, for creating portable Web services.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for our exploration, the components of the .NET Framework
      that we care about are the Common Language Runtime and the C#
      language. And to nail it down beyond any doubt, these are things
      that you can download and use today. They're real, they exist
      and they work.
    </p>
    <h3>The .NET CLR</h3>
    <p>
      Let's begin with the CLR. The CLR is, in essence, a virtual
      machine for C# much like the Java VM, but which is specifically
      designed to allow a wide variety of languages other than C# to
      run on it. Does this ring any bells with Perl programmers? Yes,
      it's not entirely dissimilar to the idea of the Parrot VM, the
      host VM for Perl 6 but designed to run other languages as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's more or less where the similarity ends. For starters,
      while Parrot is chiefly intended to be ran as an interpreted VM
      but has a "bolted-on" JIT, CLR is expected to be JITted from the
      get-go. Microsoft seems to want to avoid the accusations of
      slowness leveled at Java by effectively requiring JIT compilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another "surface" distinction between Parrot and CLR is that the
      languages supported by the CLR are primarily statically typed
      languages such as C#, J#, (a variant of Java) and Visual Basic
      .NET. The languages Parrot aims to support are primarily
      dynamically typed, allowing run-time compilation, symbolic
      variable access, (try doing <code>${"Package::$var"}</code> in
      C#...) closures, and other relatively wacky operations.
    </p>
    

    
    <p>
      To address these sorts of features, the 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/project7.net/project_7.htm">Project
      7</a> research project was set up to provide .NET ports for a
      variety of "academic" languages. Unfortunately, it transpires
      that this has highlighted some limitations of the CLR, and so
      almost all of the implementations have had to modify their
      target languages slightly or drop difficult features. For
      instance, the work on <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/">Mercury</a>
      turned up some deficiencies in CLR's Common Type System that
      would also affect a Perl implementation. We'll discuss these
      deficiencies later when we examine how Perl and the .NET
      Framework can interact.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the other hand, let's not let this detract from what the
      CLR is good at - it can run a variety of different languages
      relatively efficiently, and it can share data between
      languages. Let's now take a look at C#, the native language of
      the CLR, and then see how we can run .NET executables on our
      favourite free operating systems.
    </p>
    <h3>C#</h3>
    <p>
      C# is Microsoft's new language for the .NET Framework. It shares
      some features with Java, and in fact looks extremely like Java
      at first glance. Here's a piece of C# code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
using System;

class App {
   public static void Main(string[] args) {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
      foreach (String s in args) {
         Console.WriteLine("Command-line argument: " + s);
      }
   }
}</code>
</pre>


    <p>
      Naturally, the Java-like features are quite obvious to anyone
      who's seen much Java - everything's in a class, and there's an
      explicitly defined <code>Main</code> function. But what's this -
      a Perl-like <code>foreach</code> loop. And that
      <code>using</code> declaration seems strangely familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to claim that C# is some
      bastard offspring of Perl and Java, or even that C# really has
      that much in common with Perl; it doesn't. But it is a
      well-designed language that does have a bunch of
      "programmer-friendly" language features that traditionally made
      "scripting" languages like Perl or Python faster for rapid code
      prototyping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's some more code, which forms part of a game-of-life
      benchmarking tool we used to benchmark the CLR against Parrot.
    </p>
<pre><code>
    static String generate(String input) {
        int cell, neighbours;
        int len = input.Length;
        String output = "";
        cell = 0; 
        do {
            neighbours = 0;
            foreach (int offset in new Int32[] {-16, -15, -14, -1, 1, 14, 15, 16}) {
                int pos = (offset + len + cell) % len;
                if (input.Substring(pos, 1) == "*")
                    neighbours++; 
            }
            if (input.Substring(cell, 1) == "*") {
                output += (neighbours &lt; 2 || neighbours &gt; 3) ? " " : "*";
            } else {
                output += (neighbours == 3) ? "*" : " ";
            } 
        } while (++cell < len); 
        return output;
    }</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      This runs one generation of the <a href="http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html">game
      of life</a>, taking an input playing field and building an
      output string. What's remarkable about this is that I wrote it
      after a day of looking at C# code, with no prior exposure to
      Java. C# is certainly easy to pick up.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can Perl learn from C#? That's an interesting question,
      especially as the Perl 6 design project is ongoing. Let's have a
      a quick look at some of the innovations in C# and how we might
      apply them to Perl.
    </p>
    <h4>Strong Names</h4>
    <p>
      We'll start with an easy one, since Larry has already said that
      something like this will already be in Perl 6: To avoid
      versioning clashes and interface incompatibilities, .NET has the
      concept of "strong names." Assemblies -- the C# equivalent of
      Java's <code>jar</code> files -- have metadata containing their
      name, version number, md5sum and cryptographic signature,
      meaning you can be sure you're always going to get the
      definitions and behavior you'd expect from any third-party code
      you run. More generally, assemblies support arbitrary metadata
      that you can use to annotate their contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach to versioning and metadata in Perl 6 was
      highlighted in Larry's <a
      href="/pub/a/2001/07/25/onion.html">State of
      the Onion</a> talk this year, and is also the solution used by
      JavaScript 2.0, as described by Waldemar Horwat at his <a
      href="/pub/a/2001/11/21/lightweight.html">LL1
      presentation</a>, so it seems to be the way the language world
      is going.
    </p>
    <h4>Properties</h4>
    <p>
      C# supports properties, which are class fields with explicit
      get/set methods. This is slightly akin to Perl's tying, but
      much, much slicker. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    private int MyInt;
    public int SomeInt {
        get {
            Console.WriteLine("I was got.\n");
            return MyInt;
        }
        set {
            Console.WriteLine("I was set.\n");
            MyInt = value;
        }
    }</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Whenever we access <code>SomeInt</code>, the <code>get</code>
      accessor is executed, and returns the value of the underlying
      <code>MyInt</code> variable; when we write to it, the
      corresponding <code>set</code> accessor is called. Here's one
      suggested way we could do something similar in Perl 6:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      my $myint;
      our $SomeInt :get(sub{ print "I was got!\n"; $myint })
                   :set(sub{ print "I was set!\n"; $myint = $^a });</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      C# actually takes this idea slightly further, providing
      "indexers", which are essentially tied arrays:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    private String realString;
    public String substrString[int idx] {
        get {
            return realString.Substring(idx, 1);
        }
        set {
            realString = realString(0, idx) + value + realString(idx+1);
        }
    }

    substrString[12] = "*"; // substr($string, 12, 1) = "*";</code>
</pre>
    <h4>Object-Value Duality</h4>
    <p>
      Within the CLR type system, (CTS) there are two distinct
      types (as it were) of types: reference types and value
      types. Value types are the simple, honest-to-God values:
      integers, floating point numbers, strings, and so on. Reference
      types, on the other hand, are objects, references, pointers and
      the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the twist: Each value type has an associated reference
      type, and you can convert values between them. So, if you've got
      an <code>int counter;</code>, then you can "box" it as an object like so:
      <code>Object CounterObj = counter</code>. More specifically,
      <code>int</code> corresponds to <code>Int32</code>. This gives
      us the flexibility of objects when we need to, for instance,
      call methods on them, but the speed of fixed values when we're
      doing tight loops on the stack. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While Perl is and needs to remain an essentially untyped
      language, optional explicit typing definitions combined with
      object-value duality could massively up Perl's flexibility as
      well as bringing some potential optimizations.
    </p>











    
    <h4>Chaining Delegates</h4>
    <p>
      Here's an extremely rare thing - a non-obvious use of operator
      overloading that actually makes some sense. In event-driven
      programming, you'll often want to assign callbacks to happen on
      a given event. Here's how C# does it: (The following code adapted
      from <a
      href="http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive253.html">Events
      in C#</a> by Sanju)
    </p>
    <pre><code>
delegate void ButtonEventHandler(object source, int clickCount);

class Button {
    public event ButtonEventHandler ButtonClick;

    public void clicked(int count) { // Fire the handler
        if (ButtonClick != null) ButtonClick (this,count);
    }
}

public class Dialog {
    public Dialog() {
        Button b = new Button();

        b.ButtonClick += new ButtonEventHandler(onButtonAction);
        b.clicked(1);
    }
}

public void onButtonAction(object source,int clickCount) {
    //Define the actions to be performed on button-click here.
}</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Can you see what's going on? The "delegate" type
      <code>ButtonEventHandler</code> is a function signature that we
      can use to handle button click events. Our <code>Button</code>
      class has one of these handlers, <code>ButtonClick</code>, which
      is defined as an <code>event</code>. In the <code>Dialog</code>
      class, we instatiate a new delegate, using the
      <code>onButtonAction</code> function to fulfill the role of a
      <code>ButtonEventHandler</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notice how we assign it to the <code>Button</code>'s
      <code>ButtonClick</code> field - we use addition. We can add
      more handlers in the same way:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    b.ButtonClick += new ButtonEventHandler(myButtonHandler);
    b.ButtonClick += new ButtonEventHandler(otherButtonHandler);</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      And now when the button's <code>clicked</code> method fires off
      the delegates, all three of these functions will be called in
      turn. We might decide that we need to get rid of one of them:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    b.ButtonClick -= new ButtonEventHandler(myButtonHandler);</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      After that, only the two functions <code>onButtonAction</code>
      and <code>otherButtonHandler</code> are active. Chaining
      delegates like this is something I haven't seen in any other
      language, and makes sense for event-based
      programming; it's something it might be good for Perl 6 to support.
    </p>
    <h3>Mono and Rotor - Running .NET</h3>
    <p>
      OK, enough talk about C#. Let's go run some.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the easiest way to do this at present is to do your
      development on a Windows box. Just grab a copy of the <a
      href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml">.NET
      Framework SDK</a>, (only 137M!) install it, and you have a C#
      compiler at your disposal which can produce .NET executables
      running on the Microsoft CLR. This is how I do my C#
      experimentation - I have a copy of Windows running on a virtual
      machine, sharing a filesystem with my OS X laptop. I do my
      editing in my favourite Unix editor, then pop over to the
      Windows session to run the <code>CSC</code> compiler. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that for some of us, however, that's not a great
      solution. Thankfully, the creative monkeys at <a
      href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a> have been feverishly
      working on bringing us an open-sourced .NET Framework
      implementation. The <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a>
      project comprises of an implementation of the Common Language
      Runtime plus a C# compiler and other goodies; a very easy way to
      get started with .NET is to pick up a release of Mono, and compile
      and install it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the usual <code>./configure;make;make install</code>, you
      have three new commands at your disposal: <code>mcs</code> is
      the Mono C# compiler; <code>mint</code> is the CLR Interpreter;
      and <code>mono</code> is its JITted cousin. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, Veronica, you can run .NET <code>EXE</code> files on
      Linux. Let's take the first C# example from the top of this
      article, and run it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
 % mcs -o hello.exe hello.cs
 % mono hello.exe A Test Program
Hello World
Command-line argument: A
Command-line argument: Test
Command-line argument: Program
RESULT: 0</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      And just to show you we're not messing you around:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
 % file hello.exe
hello.exe: MS Windows PE 32-bit Intel 80386 console executable</code>
</pre>
    <p>
      Mono isn't a particularly quick runtime, nor is it particularly
      complete, but it has a large number of hackers improving its
      base classes every day. It runs a large percentage of the .NET
      executables I throw at it, and the <code>mcs</code> compiler can
      now compile itself, so you can do all your development using
      open source tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option, once it appears, is Microsoft's <a
      href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/03/04/rotor.html">Rotor</a>
      project, a shared source CLR and compiler suite. Rotor aims to
      be the ECMA standard implementation of the .NET Framework;
      Microsoft has submitted the Framework for standardization, but
      in typical style, its own implementations add extra
      functionality not part of the standard. Oh, and in case the
      words "shared source" haven't jumped out at you yet, do not even
      <i>consider</i> looking at Rotor if you may work on Mono at some
      point. However, for the casual user, its comprehensive
      implementation means it will be a better short-term choice for
      .NET experimentation - again, once it's released.
    </p>
    <h3>CLR Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      Before we finish considering how Perl and the .NET Framework
      relate to each other, let's take a more in-depth look at the
      internals of the Common Language Runtime compared to our own Parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the CLR is a stack-based virtual machine, as opposed
      to Parrot's register approach. I don't know why this approach
      was taken, other than, I imagine, "because everyone else does
      it." CLR runs a bytecode language, which Microsoft calls MS-IL
      when it is talking about their implementation of CLR, and what
      it calls CIL (Common Intermediate Language) to ECMA. It's
      object-oriented assembler, a true horror to behold, but it
      works. Here's a fragment of the IL for our Hello example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    .method public static 
           default void Main(string[] args)  cil managed 
    {
        // Method begins at RVA 0x2090
        .entrypoint

    <p>
      In order to optimize CLR for JITting, it imposes a number of
      restrictions on the IL. For instance, the stack may only be used
      to store parameters and return values from operations and calls;
      you can't access arbitrary points in the stack; more
      significantly, the types of values on the stack have to be
      statically determinable and invariant.  That's to say, at a
      given call in the code, you know for sure what types of things
      are on the stack at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The types themselves are part of the Common Type System,
      something every language compiling to .NET has to conform to. As
      we have mentioned, CTS types are either value types or reference
      types. There's a smaller subset of CTS called the Common Language
      Specification, CLS. Languages <B>must</b> implement CLS types,
      and may implement their own types as part of the CTS. The CLS
      ought to be used in all "outward-facing" APIs where two
      different languages might meet; the idea being the data passed
      between two languages is guaranteed to have a known meaning and
      semantics. However, this API restriction is not enforced by the
      VM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Types which can appear on the stack are restricted again; you're
      allowed int32, int64, int, float, a reference, a "managed"
      pointer or an unmanaged pointer. "Management" is determined by
      where the pointer comes from (trusted code is managed) and
      influences what it's allowed to see and how it gets GCed. Local
      arguments may live somewhere other than on the main stack - this
      is implementation-defined - in which case they have access to a
      richer set of types; but since you have a reference to an
      object, you should be OK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other value types include structures and enumerations. Since
      value types are passed around on the stack, you can't really
      have big structures, since you'd be passing loads of
      data. There's also the typed reference, which is a reference
      plus something storing what sort of reference it is. Reference
      types are kept in the heap, managed by garbage collection, and
      are referenced on the stack. This is not unlike what Parrot does
      with PMC and non-PMC registers.
</p>
    <p>
      Like Java, the CLR has a reasonably small number of
      operations. You can load/store constants, local variables,
      arguments, fields and array elements; you can create and
      dereference pointers; you can do arithmetic; you can do
      conversion, casting and truncating; there are branch ops
      (including a built-in lookup-table switch op) and method call
      ops; there's a special tail-recursion method-call op; you can
      throw and handle exceptions; you can box and unbox, converting
      value types to reference types and vice verca; you can
      create an array and find its length; you can handle typed
      references. And that's essentially it. Anything else is outside
      the realm of the CLR, and has to be implemented with external
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent paper comparing the CLR and the JVM has been
      produced by the team working on Component Pascal; they've ported
      CP to both virtual machines, and so are very well-placed to run
      a comparison. See the <a
      href="http://www2.fit.qut.edu.au/CompSci/PLAS//ComponentPascal/">GPCP

    <h3>Perl and .NET</h3>
    <p>
      How can we connect Perl and .NET? Well, let's look at the
      pieces of work that have already been done in this
      area. ActiveState have been leading research, with their
      experimental <a
      href="http://www.activestate.com/Initiatives/NET/Research.html">Perl
      for .NET Research</a> and <a
      href="http://www.activestate.com/PerlNET/">PerlNET</a> projects.
</p>
    <p>
      Perl for .NET Research was a brave idea; Jan Dubois essentially
      wrote a Perl interpreter in C#, and used the standard Perl
      compilation technique of combining an embedded interpreter with
      a serialized representation of the Perl program. The resulting
      compiler is a C# analog of the <code>B::CC</code> module, and
      then runs the <code>CSC</code> compiler to compile the C#
      representation of the Perl program, linking in the Perl
      interpreter, into an executable. To be honest, I couldn't get
      Perl for .NET Research to produce executables, but I could study
      it enough to see what it was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      PerlNET, now included with AS's Perl Dev Kit, takes a rather
      different approach. This time the Perl interpreter sits
      "outside" the .NET Framework, communicating with it through
      DLLs. This allows for .NET Framework code to call into Perl, and
      also for Perl to make calls into the .NET Framework library. For
      instance, one may write:
    </p>
    <pre>
    use namespace "System";
    Console->WriteLine("Hello World!");
</pre>
    <p>
      to call the <code>System.Console.WriteLine</code> method in the
      .NET Framework runtime library.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, neither of these initiatives compile Perl to MS-IL in
      the usual sense of the word. This is surprising, since it would
      be an interesting test of the flexibility of the Common Type
      System. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the possible avenues I'd like to see explored in terms of bringing .NET and Perl closer
      together. Other possibilities include crossover between CLR and
      Parrot - I'd love to see .NET executables run on top of Parrot
      and Parrot bytecode files convertable to .NET; I'd like to see a
      Perl 6 interpreter emit MS-IL; I'd like to see Perl programs
      sharing data and objects with other languages on top of some
      virtual machine. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like it or not, there's a good chance that the .NET
      Framework is going to be a big part of the technological scene
      in the future. I hope after this brief introduction, you're a
      little more prepared for it when it happens, and we have some
      direction as to how Perl fits into it.
