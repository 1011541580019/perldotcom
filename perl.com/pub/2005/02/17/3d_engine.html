<br clear="all">
<p>This article is the third in a series aimed at <a
href="/pub/au/Broadwell_Geoff">building a full 3D engine in Perl</a>.  The <a
href="/pub/a/2004/12/01/3d_engine.html">first article</a> started with basic
program structure and worked up to displaying a simple depth-buffered scene in
an OpenGL window.  The <a href="/pub/a/2004/12/29/3d_engine.html">second
article</a> followed with a discussion of time, view animation, SDL events,
keyboard handling, and a nice chunk of refactoring.</p>

<p><em>Editor's note: see also the next article in the series, <a href="/pub/a/2005/08/04/3d_engine.html">profiling your application</a>.</em></p>

<p>Later in this article, I'll discuss movement of the view position,
continue the refactoring work by cleaning up <code>draw_view</code>, and begin
to improve the look of our scene using OpenGL lighting and materials.
Before I cover that, your feedback to the previous articles has
included a couple of common requests: screenshots and help with porting
issues.  If you're having problems running SDL_Perl and the
<a href="/2005/02/17/examples/perl_opengl_3_examples.tar.gz">sample code</a>
from these articles on your system, or might be able to help
the Mac OS X and Win32 readers, take a look at the next section.
Otherwise, skip down to the <a href="#Screenshots">Screenshots</a> section, where the main
article begins.</p>

<h3>Known Porting Issues</h3>

<h4 id="General">General</h4>

<p>Some versions of SDL_Perl require that the program load SDL::Constants
to recognize <code>SDL_QUIT</code> and other constants.  As this change should
be transparent to other users, I have merged that into the latest
version of the sample code, retroactive to the first use of an SDL
constant.</p>

<h4>FreeBSD</h4>

<p>See the suggestions at the beginning of the
<a href="/pub/a/2004/12/29/3d_engine.html">second article</a>.</p>

 <csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/911" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<!-- sidebar ends -->

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>

<p>I spent some time research the porting issues on Mac OS X but am as yet unable
to figure out a simple procedure for building SDL_Perl from scratch.  Recent
emails on the <i>sdl-devel</i> mailing list seem to indicate that Mac OS X builds
for recent SDL_Perl sources are problematic right now, but older releases seem
to be even worse.  There have been some packaging attempts in the past, but none
that I have found so far install a fully configured set of SDL_Perl libraries
into the system <code>perl</code>.  I'm no Mac porting expert, so I appreciate any help on
this; please post a comment in this month's article discussion if you have a
suggestion or solution.</p>

<h4>Slackware</h4>

<p>According to comments by Federico (<code>ironfede</code>) in last month's
<a href="/pub/a/2004/12/29/3d_engine.html?page=last#thread">article discussion</a>,
Slackware ships with a version of SDL_Perl that requires
SDL::Constants.  This is not an issue for the current version
of the sample code, which I fixed as mentioned above in the
<a href="#General">General</a> issues paragraph.</p>

<h4>Win32</h4>

<p>Win32 porting went as did Mac OS X porting.  I was quite excited when chromatic
pointed me to some old Win32 PPM packages, but sadly they don't include a
working version of SDL::OpenGL.  Building manually was &quot;interesting&quot; at best, as
I have no access to a Microsoft compiler and precious little experience using
<code>gcc</code> under Win32.  As with the Mac folks, I appreciate any help from the
readers.  Please post a comment in this month's article discussion if you have
a suggestion or solution for your fellows.</p>

<h3 id="Screenshots">Screenshots</h3>

<p>Thankfully, screenshots are much easier to handle than porting issues.  I'd like
the user to be able to take a screenshot whenever desired.  The obvious way to
accomplish that is to bind the screenshot action to a key; I chose function key
<code>F4</code> at random.  First I added it to the <code>bind</code> hash:</p>

<pre><code>        bind   =&gt; {
            escape =&gt; 'quit',
            f4     =&gt; 'screenshot',
            left   =&gt; '+yaw_left',
            right  =&gt; '+yaw_right',
            tab    =&gt; '+look_behind',
        }</code></pre>

<p>The new key must have an action routine, so I altered that lookup hash as
well:</p>

<pre><code>    $self-&gt;{lookup}{command_action} = {
          quit         =&gt; \&amp;action_quit,
          screenshot   =&gt; \&amp;action_screenshot,
        '+yaw_left'    =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+yaw_right'   =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+look_behind' =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
    };</code></pre>

<p>I need to wait until drawing completes for the entire scene before I
can take a snapshot, but event processing happens before drawing begins.
To work around this, I set a state variable marking that the user has
requested a screenshot, rather than perform the screenshot immediately:</p>

<pre><code>sub action_screenshot
{
    my $self = shift;

    $self-&gt;{state}{need_screenshot} = 1;
}</code></pre>

<p>The code checks this state variable in a new line at the end of <code>end_frame</code>,
after the drawing has completed and it has synced the screen with the
image written into OpenGL's color buffer:</p>

<pre><code>sub end_frame
{
    my $self = shift;

    $self-&gt;{resource}{sdl_app}-&gt;sync;
    $self-&gt;screenshot if $self-&gt;{state}{need_screenshot};
}</code></pre>

<p>The <code>screenshot</code> routine is surprisingly short but dense:</p>

<pre><code>sub screenshot
{
    my $self = shift;

    my $file = 'screenshot.bmp';
    my $w    = $self-&gt;{conf}{width};
    my $h    = $self-&gt;{conf}{height};

    glReadBuffer(GL_FRONT);
    my $data = glReadPixels(0, 0, $w, $h, GL_BGR,
                            GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE);
    SDL::OpenGL::SaveBMP($file, $w, $h, 24, $data);

    $self-&gt;{state}{need_screenshot} = 0;
}</code></pre>

<p>The routine starts by specifying a filename for the screenshot and
gathering the width and height of the screen.  The real work begins
with the call to <code>glReadBuffer</code>.  Depending on the OpenGL driver, the
hardware, and a number of advanced settings, OpenGL may have provided
<em>several</em> color buffers in which to draw and read images.  In fact,
the default behavior on most systems is to draw onto one buffer, known
as the <em>back buffer</em>, and display a separate buffer, known as the
<em>front buffer</em>.  After completing the drawing for each frame, the
<code>SDL::App::sync</code> call moves the image from the back buffer to the
front buffer so the user can see it.  Behind the scenes, OpenGL
generally handles this in one of two different ways, depending on the
underlying implementation.  Software OpenGL implementations, such as
Mesa, copy the data from the back buffer to the front buffer.  Hardware-accelerated systems can swap internal pointers so that the
back buffer becomes the front buffer and vice versa.  As you can
imagine, this is much faster.</p>

<p>This extra work brings a great benefit.  Without double buffering, as
soon as one frame completes, the next frame immediately clears
the screen to black and starts drawing again from scratch.  Depending
on the relative speed difference between the user's monitor and the
application, this would probably appear to the user as a flickering,
dark, perpetually half-drawn scene.  With double buffering, this
problem is almost gone.  The front buffer shows a solid stable image
while all of the drawing is done on the back buffer.  Once the drawing
completes, it takes at most a few milliseconds to sync up and start
displaying the new frame.  To the human eye, the animation appears
solid, bright, and (hopefully) smooth.</p>

<p>In this case, I want to make sure that I take a screenshot of exactly
the same image the user sees, so I tell OpenGL that I want to read the
image in the front buffer (<code>GL_FRONT</code>).</p>

<p>At this point, it's safe to read the image data into a Perl buffer in
the proper format.  The first four arguments to <code>glReadPixels</code> specify
the lower-left corner and size of the sub-image to read.  The next two
arguments together tell OpenGL what format I would like for the data.
I specify that I want to read the entire window and that I want the
data in the correct format for a BMP file--one unsigned byte for
each of the red, green, and blue color channels for each pixel, but in
reverse order.</p>

<p>Once I have the data from OpenGL I use the SDL_Perl utility routine
<code>SaveBMP</code> to save the image into a file.  The arguments are the
filename, image width, image height, color depth (24 bits per pixel),
and data buffer.  Finally, the routine resets the <code>need_screenshot</code>
state flag and returns.</p>

<p>At this point you should be able to take a screenshot each time you press the
<code>F4</code> key.  Of course, I'd like to show several screenshots during this article as
the code progresses.  The current code overwrites the previous screenshot file
every time I request a new one.  Because I number each runnable version of the
code, I used a quick workaround resulting in a different screenshot filename
for each code step.  I first load one of the core Perl modules to strip
directories from a path:</p>

<pre><code>use File::Basename;</code></pre>

<p>Then I use the filename of the script itself as part of my screenshot
filename:</p>

<pre><code>    my $file = basename($0) . '.bmp';</code></pre>

<p>This may be all you need for your application, or you may want to
add some code to number each file uniquely.  This code is enough to
fix my problem, so I've left the more powerful version as an
exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Here then is the first screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step042.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>The observant reader will notice that this image is not a BMP file; it's a
PNG image, which is both much smaller than a BMP and more friendly to web
standards.  There are many tools available that can perform this conversion.
Any good image editor can do it. In this case that's overkill--I instead used
the <code>convert</code> program from the <a
href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> suite of utilities:</p>

<pre><code>convert step042.bmp step042.png</code></pre>













<h3>Moving the Viewpoint</h3>

<p>That view is more than a tad overplayed.  The user can't even move the
viewpoint to see the back or sides of the scene.  It's time to
change that.  I started by defining some new key bindings:</p>

<pre><code>        bind   =&gt; {
            escape =&gt; 'quit',
            f4     =&gt; 'screenshot',
            a      =&gt; '+move_left',
            d      =&gt; '+move_right',
            w      =&gt; '+move_forward',
            s      =&gt; '+move_back',
            left   =&gt; '+yaw_left',
            right  =&gt; '+yaw_right',
            tab    =&gt; '+look_behind',
        }</code></pre>

<p>I then updated the <code>command_action</code> <code>lookup</code> hash to handle these as
movement keys:</p>

<pre><code>    $self-&gt;{lookup}{command_action} = {
          quit          =&gt; \&amp;action_quit,
          screenshot    =&gt; \&amp;action_screenshot,
        '+move_left'    =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+move_right'   =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+move_forward' =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+move_back'    =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+yaw_left'     =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+yaw_right'    =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
        '+look_behind'  =&gt; \&amp;action_move,
    };</code></pre>

<p><code>init_view</code> needs to initialize two more velocity components and
matching deltas:</p>

<pre><code>    $self-&gt;{world}{view} = {
        position    =&gt; [6, 2, 10],
        orientation =&gt; [0, 0, 1, 0],
        d_yaw       =&gt; 0,
        v_yaw       =&gt; 0,
        v_forward   =&gt; 0,
        v_right     =&gt; 0,
        dv_yaw      =&gt; 0,
        dv_forward  =&gt; 0,
        dv_right    =&gt; 0,
    };</code></pre>

<p><code>action_move</code> needs a new movement speed to match the existing yaw
speed and some additions to <code>%move_update</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    my $speed_move       = 5;
    my %move_update      = (
        '+yaw_left'     =&gt; [dv_yaw     =&gt;  $speed_yaw ],
        '+yaw_right'    =&gt; [dv_yaw     =&gt; -$speed_yaw ],
        '+move_right'   =&gt; [dv_right   =&gt;  $speed_move],
        '+move_left'    =&gt; [dv_right   =&gt; -$speed_move],
        '+move_forward' =&gt; [dv_forward =&gt;  $speed_move],
        '+move_back'    =&gt; [dv_forward =&gt; -$speed_move],
        '+look_behind'  =&gt; [d_yaw      =&gt;  180        ],
    );</code></pre>

<p>So far, the changes are mostly hash updates instead of procedural code;
that's a good sign that the existing code design has some more life
left.  When conceptually simple changes require significant code
modification, especially special cases or repetitive blocks of code,
it's time to look for a refactoring opportunity.  Thankfully, these
changes are in initialization and configuration rather than special cases.</p>

<p>One routine that requires a good bit of new code is
<code>update_view</code>.  I added these lines to the end:</p>

<pre><code>    $view-&gt;{v_right}        += $view-&gt;{dv_right};
    $view-&gt;{dv_right}        = 0;
    $view-&gt;{v_forward}      += $view-&gt;{dv_forward};
    $view-&gt;{dv_forward}      = 0;

    my $vx                   =  $view-&gt;{v_right};
    my $vz                   = -$view-&gt;{v_forward};
    $view-&gt;{position}[0]    += $vx * $d_time;
    $view-&gt;{position}[2]    += $vz * $d_time;</code></pre>

<p>That routine is beginning to look a bit repetitious and has several
copies of very similar lines of code, so it goes on the list of places
to refactor in the future.  There are not yet enough cases
to make the best solution obvious, so I'll hold off for a bit.</p>

<p>The new code starts by applying the new velocity deltas in the same
way that it updates <code>v_yaw</code> earlier in the routine.  It converts the right and
forward velocities to velocities along the world axes by noting that
the view starts out with &quot;forward&quot; parallel to the negative Z axis and
&quot;right&quot; parallel to the positive X axis.  It then multiplies the X and Z
velocities by the time delta to arrive at a position change, which it
adds into the current view position.</p>

<p>This version of the code works fine as long as the user doesn't rotate
the view.  When the view rotates, &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;right&quot; don't match
the new view directions.  They still point down the -Z and +X axes
respectively, which can prove very disorienting for high rotations.
The solution is a bit of trigonometry.  The idea is treat the initial
X and Z velocities as components of the total velocity vector,
and rotate that vector through the same angle that the user rotated
the view:</p>

<pre><code>    my $vx                   =  $view-&gt;{v_right};
    my $vz                   = -$view-&gt;{v_forward};
    my $angle                = $view-&gt;{orientation}[0];
    ($vx, $vz)               = rotate_xz($angle, $vx, $vz);
    $view-&gt;{position}[0]    += $vx * $d_time;
    $view-&gt;{position}[2]    += $vz * $d_time;</code></pre>

<p>The two middle lines are the new ones.  They call <code>rotate_xz</code> to do
the vector rotation work and then set <code>$vx</code> and <code>$vz</code> to the returned
components of the rotated velocity vector.  <code>rotate_xz</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>sub rotate_xz
{
    my ($angle, $x, $z) = @_;

    my $radians = $angle * PI / 180;
    my $cos     = cos($radians);
    my $sin     = sin($radians);
    my $rot_x   =  $cos * $x + $sin * $z;
    my $rot_z   = -$sin * $x + $cos * $z;

    return ($rot_x, $rot_z);
}</code></pre>

<p>After converting the angle from degrees to radians, the code
calculates and saves the sine and cosine of the angle.  It then
calculates the rotated velocity components given the original
unrotated components.  Finally, it returns the rotated components to
the caller.</p>

<p>I'll skip the derivation here (you're welcome), but if you're curious
about how and why this calculation performs a rotation, there are
numerous books that explain the wonders of vector mathematics in
amazing detail.  O'Reilly's
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/physicsgame/">Physics for Game Developers</a>,
by David M. Bourg, includes a high-level discussion of rotation.
Charles River Media's
<a href="http://www.charlesriver.com/titles/lengyelmath2.html">Mathematics for 3D Game Programming &amp; Computer Graphics</a>,
by Eric Lengyel, includes a deeper discussion though I, for one, have
college math flashbacks every time I read it.  Speaking of which, any
college textbook on linear algebra should include as much detail as
you desire.</p>

<p>This code requires a definition for <code>PI</code>, provided by the following
line near the top of the program, right after requesting warnings
from Perl:</p>

<pre><code>use constant PI =&gt; 4 * atan2(1, 1);</code></pre>

<p>The <code>constant</code> module evaluates possibly complex calculations during the
compile phase and then converts them into constants at runtime.  The
above calculation takes advantage of a standard trig identity to derive a
value for <code>PI</code> accurate to as many digits as the system can deliver.</p>

<p><code>update_view</code> now does the right thing, no matter what angle the view
is facing.  It doesn't take long to find a more interesting view:</p>

<h3>Let There Be Lighting!</h3>

<p>Okay, so maybe that's not <em>much</em> more interesting, admittedly. 
This scene needs a little mood lighting instead of the flat colors
I've used so far (especially because they make it hard to see the
shape of each object clearly).  As a first step, I turned on OpenGL's
lighting system with a new line at the end of <code>prep_frame</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);</code></pre>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step045.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>Far from lighting the scene, the view is now almost black.  If you
look very carefully and your monitor and room lighting are forgiving,
you should be able to just make out the objects, which are very dark
gray on the black background.  In order to see anything, I must enable
both <code>GL_LIGHTING</code> and one or more lights to provide light to the
scene.  Without a light, the objects are dark gray instead of true
black because OpenGL, by default, applies a very small amount of light
to the entire scene, known as <em>ambient</em> light.  To show the objects
more brightly, I turned on the first OpenGL light with another new line
at the end of <code>prep_frame</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);</code></pre>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step046.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>Now the objects are brighter, but they're still just gray.  When
calculating colors with lighting enabled, OpenGL uses a completely
different set of parameters from the colors used when lighting is
disabled.  Together these new parameters make up a <em>material</em>.
Complex interactions between the parameters that make up a material
can result in very interesting color effects, but in this case, I'm not
trying to create a complex effect.  I want my objects to have their
old colors back without worrying about the full complexity that
materials provide.  Thankfully, OpenGL provides a way to state that
the current material should default to the current color.  To do this,
I add yet another line to the end of <code>prep_frame</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    glEnable(GL_COLOR_MATERIAL);</code></pre>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step047.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>At this point, the objects once again have color, but each of the
faces is still the same shade rather than appearing to be lit by a
single light source somewhere.  The problem is that OpenGL does not
know whether each face points toward or away from the light and, if
so, by  how much.  The angle between the face and the light determines how
much light falls on the surface and, therefore, how bright it should
appear.  It is possible to calculate the angle of each face in my
scene from the location of its vertices, but this is not always the
right thing to do (especially when dealing with curved surfaces), so
OpenGL does not calculate this internally.  Instead, the program needs
to do the direction calculations and tell OpenGL the result, known as
the <em>normal vector</em>.</p>

<p>Luckily, in <code>draw_cube</code> the faces align with the coordinate axes so
that each face points down one of them (positive or negative
X, Y, or Z).  I don't have to do any calculation here, just tell
OpenGL which normal vector to associate with each face:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_cube
{
    # A simple cube
    my @indices = qw( 4 5 6 7   1 2 6 5   0 1 5 4
                      0 3 2 1   0 4 7 3   2 3 7 6 );
    my @vertices = ([-1, -1, -1], [ 1, -1, -1],
                    [ 1,  1, -1], [-1,  1, -1],
                    [-1, -1,  1], [ 1, -1,  1],
                    [ 1,  1,  1], [-1,  1,  1]);
    my @normals = ([0, 0,  1], [ 1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0],
                   [0, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 0], [0,  1, 0]);

    glBegin(GL_QUADS);

    foreach my $face (0 .. 5) {
        my $normal = $normals[$face];
        glNormal(@$normal);

        foreach my $vertex (0 .. 3) {
            my $index  = $indices[4 * $face + $vertex];
            my $coords = $vertices[$index];
            glVertex(@$coords);
        }
    }
    glEnd;
}</code></pre>

<p>The new lines are the definition of the <code>@normals</code> array and the two
lines at the top of the <code>$face</code> loop that select the correct normal
for each face and pass it to OpenGL using <code>glNormal</code>.</p>

<p>The boxes are now shaded reasonably and it's clear that the light
is coming from somewhere behind the viewer; the front faces are
brighter than the sides.  Unfortunately, the axes are now dark again:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step048.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>I did not specify any normal for the axis lines because the concept
doesn't make a whole lot of sense for lines or points.  However,
with lighting enabled, OpenGL needs a set of normals for every lit
object, so it goes back to the current state and uses the most
recently defined normal.  For the very first frame this is the default
normal, which happens to point towards the default first light, but for
succeeding frames it will be the last normal set in <code>draw_cube</code>.
The latter definitely does not point toward the light, and the axes end
up dark.</p>

<p>I'd rather the axis lines didn't take part in lighting calculations at
all and kept their original bright colors, regardless of any lighting
(or lack thereof) in the scene.  To do this, I removed the line that
enables <code>GL_LIGHTING</code> in <code>prep_frame</code> and inserted two new
lines near the top of <code>draw_view</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_view
{
    glDisable(GL_LIGHTING);

    draw_axes();

    glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);</code></pre>

<p>Now lighting is off before drawing the axis lines and back on
afterward.  The axis lines have bright colors again, but rotating
the view exposes a new problem. When the view rotates, the direction of
the light changes as well:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step049.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>Because of the way that OpenGL calculates light position and direction, any
lights defined before the view is set are fixed to the viewer like the light on
a miner's helmet.  To fix a light relative to the simulated world, define the
light instead after setting the view.  I removed the line enabling
<code>GL_LIGHT0</code> in <code>prep_frame</code> and moved it to the new
routine <code>set_world_lights</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_world_lights
{
    glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
}</code></pre>

<p>I then updated <code>draw_frame</code> to call the new routine after setting the
view:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_frame
{
    my $self = shift;

    $self-&gt;set_projection_3d;
    $self-&gt;set_view_3d;
    $self-&gt;set_world_lights;
    $self-&gt;draw_view;
}</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't work.  OpenGL only updates its internal
state with the light's position and direction when they 
change explicitly, not when the light is enabled or disabled.  I've
never set the light's parameters explicitly, so the original default
still stands.  This issue is easy to fix with another line in
<code>set_world_lights</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_world_lights
{
    glLight(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);

    glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
}</code></pre>

<p>In one of the few OpenGL interface decisions that actively annoys me,
the new line sets the <em>direction</em> of the light, not its position.
OpenGL defines all lights as one of two types: <em>directional</em> or
<em>positional</em>.  OpenGL assumes directional lights are very far away
so that anywhere in the scene the direction from the light to each
object is effectively the same.  Positional lights are nearer and
OpenGL must calculate the direction from the light to every vertex of
every object in the scene independently.  As you can imagine, this is
much slower, but produces more interesting lighting effects.</p>

<p>The key to choosing between these two types is the last parameter of
the <code>glLight</code> call above.  If this parameter is <code>0</code>, the light is
directional and the other three coordinates specify the direction
from which the light comes.  In this case, I've specified that the
light should come <em>from</em> the +Z direction.  If the last parameter is
<code>1</code>, then OpenGL makes the light positional and uses the other three
coordinates to set the light's position within the scene.  For now,
I'll skip the gory details of what happens when a value other than <code>0</code>
or <code>1</code> is used, but in short, the light will be positional and extra
calculations determine the actual position used.  Most of the time
it's best to ignore that case.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I explicitly specified <code>0.0</code> and
<code>1.0</code> instead of <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.  This is a
workaround for a bug in <code>glLight</code> in some versions of SDL_Perl when it is
presented with integer arguments instead of floating-point arguments.</p>

<p>With this line added, the light now stays fixed in the world, even when
the user moves and rotates the view:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step051.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>













<h3>A Lantern</h3>

<p>Of course, sometimes a light connected to the viewer is exactly the
intention.  For example, perhaps the desired effect is for the player
to hold a lantern or flashlight to light dark places.  Both of
these are localized light sources that light nearby objects quite a
bit, but distant objects only a little.  The primary difference between
them is that a flashlight and certain types of lanterns cast light
primarily in one direction, often in a cone.  Most
lanterns, torches, and similar light sources cast light in all
directions (barring shadows from handles, fuel tins, and the like).</p>

<p>Non-directed light is a little simpler to implement, so I'll start
with lantern light.  I wanted the light rooted at the viewer's
position, so I defined the light before setting the view:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_frame
{
    my $self = shift;

    $self-&gt;set_projection_3d;
    $self-&gt;set_eye_lights;
    $self-&gt;set_view_3d;
    $self-&gt;set_world_lights;
    $self-&gt;draw_view;
}</code></pre>

<p>I refer to viewer-fixed lights as <em>eye lights</em> because OpenGL refers to
the coordinate system it uses for lights as <em>eye coordinates</em>, and a
light defined this way as maintaining a particular position &quot;relative
to the eye.&quot;  Here's <code>set_eye_lights</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_eye_lights
{
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);

    glEnable(GL_LIGHT1);
}</code></pre>

<p>Here I set the second light exactly the same way I set the first.
Note that it doesn't matter that I actually define the second light
in my program before the first.  Each OpenGL light is independently
numbered and always keeps the same number, rather than acting like a
stack or queue numbered by order of use.</p>

<p>Sadly, the new code doesn't seem to have any effect at all.  In
reality, there really is a new light shining on the scene--unlike
<code>GL_LIGHT0</code>, which defaults to shining bright white, all of the other
lights default to black and provide no new light to the scene.  The
solution is to set another parameter of the light:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_eye_lights
{
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_DIFFUSE,  1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

    glEnable(GL_LIGHT1);
}</code></pre>

<p>The front faces of each object should appear considerably brighter.
Moving around the scene shows that the eye light brightens a
surface only dimly lit by the world light:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step053.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>If you watch carefully, however, you'll notice that the lighting
varies by the view rotation--not position.  I defined the light as
directional with the light coming from behind the viewer, rather than
positional, with the light coming from the viewer directly.  I hinted
at the fix earlier--changing the <code>GL_POSITION</code> parameter as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);</code></pre>

<p>The light now comes from <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> in eye coordinates, right at
the viewpoint.  Moving around and rotating shows that this version has
the intended effect.</p>

<p>The simulated lantern still shines as brightly on far-away objects as
it does on near ones.  A real lantern's light falls off rapidly with
distance from the lantern.  OpenGL can do this with another setting:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_eye_lights
{
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_DIFFUSE,  1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION, 0.5);

    glEnable(GL_LIGHT1);
}</code></pre>

<p>This case tells OpenGL to include a dimming term in its equations
proportional to the distance between the light and the object.
Physics-minded readers will point out that physically accurate dimming
is proportional to the square of the distance, and OpenGL does
allow this using <code>GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION</code>.  However, a host of
factors (including the lighting equations that OpenGL uses and the
non-linear effects of the graphics hardware, monitor, and human eye)
make this more accurate dimming look rather odd.  Linear dimming turns
out to look better in many cases, so that's what I used here.  It is
also possible to combine different dimming types, so that the dimming
appears linear for nearby objects and quadratic for distant ones, which
you may find a better tradeoff.  The <code>0.5</code> setting tells OpenGL how
strong the linear dimming effect should be for my scene.</p>

<p>Moving around the scene, you should be able to see the relatively
subtle dimming effect in action.  Don't be afraid to leave it subtle
instead of turning the dimming effect way up.  Some moods call for
striking lighting effects, while others call for lighting effects that
the viewer notices only subconsciously.  In some visualization
applications, lighting subtlety is a great virtue, allowing the human
visual system's amazing processing power to come to grips with a
complex scene without being overwhelmed.</p>

<h3>A Flashlight</h3>

<p>I really happen to like the way a flashlight casts its cone of light,
so I converted the omnidirectional light of the lantern to a directed
cone.  OpenGL refers to this type of light as a <em>spotlight</em> and
includes several light parameters to define them.  The first change
is a new setting in <code>set_eye_lights</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_SPOT_CUTOFF, 15.0);</code></pre>

<p>This sets the angle between the center of the light beam and the edges
of the cone.  OpenGL accepts either 180 degrees (omnidirectional) or
any value between 0 and 90 degrees (from a laser beam to a hemisphere
of light).  In this case, I chose a centerline-to-edge angle of 15
degrees, making a nice 30-degree-wide cone of light.</p>

<p>This change indeed limits the cone of light, but also reveals an ugly
artifact.  Move to a point just in front of the left front corner of
the white cube and rotate the view to pan the light across the yellow
box.  You'll see the light jump nastily from corner to corner, even
disappearing entirely in between.  Even when a corner is lit, the
shape of the light is not very conelike:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step056.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>OpenGL's standard lighting model only performs the lighting calculations at
each vertex, interpolating the results in between.  For models that have many
small faces and a resulting high density of vertices, this works relatively
well.  It breaks down nastily in scenes containing objects with large faces and
few vertices, especially when a positional light is close to an object.
Spotlights make the problem even more apparent, as they can easily shine
<em>between</em> two vertices without lighting either of them; the polygon then
appears uniformly dark.</p>

<h3>Ode to Rush</h3>

<p>Advanced OpenGL functionality paired with recent hardware can solve this
problem with per-pixel lighting calculations.  Older hardware can fake it with
light maps and similar tricks.  Rather than using advanced functionality, I'll
use a simpler method for improving the lighting, known as <i>subdivisions</i>.  (Those
of you scratching your heads over the Rush reference can now breathe a
collective sigh of relief.) Subdivisions have their own problems, as I'll show
later, but those issues explain a lot about the design of graphics APIs, so
they're worth a look.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the basic idea is to subdivide each face into many
smaller faces, each with its own set of vertices.  For curved objects such as
spheres and cylinders, this is essential so that nearby objects appear to curve
smoothly.  For objects with large flat faces, such as boxes and pyramids, this
merely has the side effect of forcing the per-vertex lighting calculations to
be done many times across each face.</p>

<p>Before I can use subdivided faces, I need to prepare by refactoring
<code>draw_cube</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_cube
{
    # A simple cube
    my @indices = qw( 4 5 6 7   1 2 6 5   0 1 5 4
                      0 3 2 1   0 4 7 3   2 3 7 6 );
    my @vertices = ([-1, -1, -1], [ 1, -1, -1],
                    [ 1,  1, -1], [-1,  1, -1],
                    [-1, -1,  1], [ 1, -1,  1],
                    [ 1,  1,  1], [-1,  1,  1]);
    my @normals = ([0, 0,  1], [ 1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0],
                   [0, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 0], [0,  1, 0]);

    foreach my $face (0 .. 5) {
        my $normal = $normals[$face];
        my @corners;

        foreach my $vertex (0 .. 3) {
            my $index  = $indices[4 * $face + $vertex];
            my $coords = $vertices[$index];
            push @corners, $coords;
        }
        draw_quad_face(normal    =&gt; $normal,
                       corners   =&gt; \@corners);
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Instead of performing the OpenGL calls directly in <code>draw_cube</code>, it
now calls <code>draw_quad_face</code>.  For each large face it creates a new
<code>@corners</code> array filled with the vertex coordinates of the corners of
that face.  It then passes that array and the face normal to
<code>draw_quad_face</code>, defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_quad_face
{
    my %args    = @_;
    my $normal  = $args{normal};
    my $corners = $args{corners};

    glBegin(GL_QUADS);
    glNormal(@$normal);

    foreach my $coords (@$corners) {
        glVertex(@$coords);
    }
    glEnd;
}</code></pre>

<p>This function performs exactly the OpenGL operations that
<code>draw_cube</code> used to do.  I've also used a different argument-passing
style for this routine than I have previously.  In this case, I pass named
arguments because I know that I will add at least one more argument very soon
and that there's a pretty good chance I'll want to add more later.  When the
arguments to a routine are likely to change over time, and especially when
callers might want to specify only a few arguments and allow the rest to take
on reasonable defaults, named arguments are usually a better choice.  The
arguments can either be a hashref or a list stuffed into a hash.  This time, I
chose the latter method.</p>

<p>After refactoring comes testing, and a quick run showed that everything
worked as expected.  Safe in that knowledge, I rewrote
<code>draw_quad_face</code> to subdivide each face:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_quad_face
{
    my %args    = @_;
    my $normal  = $args{normal};
    my $corners = $args{corners};
    my $div     = $args{divisions} || 10;
    my ($a, $b, $c, $d) = @$corners;

    # NOTE: ASSUMES FACE IS A PARALLELOGRAM

    my $s_ab = calc_vector_step($a, $b, $div);
    my $s_ad = calc_vector_step($a, $d, $div);

    glNormal(@$normal);
    for my $strip (0 .. $div - 1) {
        my @v = ($a-&gt;[0] + $strip * $s_ab-&gt;[0],
                 $a-&gt;[1] + $strip * $s_ab-&gt;[1],
                 $a-&gt;[2] + $strip * $s_ab-&gt;[2]);

        glBegin(GL_QUAD_STRIP);
        for my $quad (0 .. $div) {
            glVertex(@v);
            glVertex($v[0] + $s_ab-&gt;[0],
                     $v[1] + $s_ab-&gt;[1],
                     $v[2] + $s_ab-&gt;[2]);

            $v[0] += $s_ad-&gt;[0];
            $v[1] += $s_ad-&gt;[1];
            $v[2] += $s_ad-&gt;[2];
        }
        glEnd;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>The new routine starts by adding the new optional argument <code>divisions</code>,
which defaults to 10.  This specifies how many subdivisions the face
should have both &quot;down&quot; and &quot;across&quot;; the actual number of sub-faces
is the square of this number.  For the default 10 divisions, that comes
to 100 sub-faces for each large face, so each cube has 600 sub-faces.</p>

<p>The next line labels the corners in counterclockwise order.  This puts
corner A diagonally across from corner C, with B on one side and D on
the other.</p>

<p>As the comment on the next line indicates, I've simplified the math
considerably by assuming that the face is at least a parallelogram.
With this simplification, I can calculate the steps for one division
along sides AB and AD and use these steps to position every sub-face
across the entire large face.</p>

<p>I can't just calculate the step as a simple distance to move, because I
have no idea which direction each edge is pointing and wouldn't know
which way to move for each step.  Instead, I calculate the vector
difference between the vertices at each end of the edge and divide
that by the number of divisions.  The code does the same calculation twice, so
I've extracted it into a separate routine:</p>

<pre><code>sub calc_vector_step
{
    my ($v1, $v2, $div) = @_;

    return [($v2-&gt;[0] - $v1-&gt;[0]) / $div,
            ($v2-&gt;[1] - $v1-&gt;[1]) / $div,
            ($v2-&gt;[2] - $v1-&gt;[2]) / $div];
}</code></pre>

<p>Returning to <code>draw_quad_face</code>, it stores the vector steps in
<code>$s_ab</code> (the step along the AB side) and <code>$s_ad</code> (the
step along the AD side).  Next it sets the current normal, which for a flat
face remains the same across its entirety.</p>

<p>Finally, I can begin to define the sub-faces themselves.  I've taken advantage
of the OpenGL quad strip primitive to draw the sub-faces as a series of parallel
strips extending from the AB edge to the CD edge.  For each strip, I first need
to calculate the location of its starting vertex.  I know this is on the AB
edge, so the code starts at A and adds an AB step for each completed strip.
For the first strip, this puts the starting vertex at A.  For the last strip,
the starting vertex will be one step (one strip width) away from B.  It
initializes the current vertex <code>@v</code> with the starting vertex and
will keep it updated as it moves along each strip.</p>

<p>It then begins a strip of quads with <code>glBegin(GL_QUAD_STRIP)</code>.  To
define the strip, I've specified the locations of each pair of vertices
across from each other along its length.  For each pair, it uses the
current vertex and a calculated vertex one step further along the
AB direction.  The code then moves the current vertex one step along the
length of the strip (the AD direction).  Once the strip is complete, it
ends it with <code>glEnd</code> and loops again for the next strip.</p>

<p>All of this complexity makes quite a visual difference:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step058.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>It's clear that the light has a definite shape to it, but the lighting
is so jagged that it's distracting.  One way to fix this is to 
increase the number of divisions, making smaller sub-faces.  This
requires a simple addition to the <code>draw_quad_face</code> call in
<code>draw_cube</code>:</p>

<pre><code>        draw_quad_face(normal    =&gt; $normal,
                       corners   =&gt; \@corners,
                       divisions =&gt; 30);</code></pre>

<p>The result is quite a bit less jagged:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step059.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the jaggies are smaller but still obviously there--and the closer the viewer is to an object the bigger they appear.
There are also nine times as many sub-faces to draw (30/10 squared)
and the program now runs considerably slower.  If you're lucky enough
to have a recent system with fast video hardware and don't notice the
slowdown, use 100 or so for the number of divisions.  You'll
probably see it.</p>













<h3>Softening the Edges</h3>

<p>Clearly, increasing the number of subdivisions only goes so far to
improve the rendering, while simultaneously costing dearly in
performance.  I'll try a different tack and go back to what I know
about a flashlight.  Most flashlights cast a beam that is brighter in
the center than at the edge.  (Some have a dark circle in the very
center, but I'm ignoring that for now.)  I can take advantage of this
to create a more accurate image and also soften the large
jaggies considerably.  First, I backed out my change to the
<code>draw_quad_face</code> call:</p>

<pre><code>        draw_quad_face(normal    =&gt; $normal,
                       corners   =&gt; \@corners);</code></pre>

<p>Then I changed one spotlight parameter for the flashlight in
<code>set_eye_lights</code> and added another:</p>

<pre><code>    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_SPOT_CUTOFF,   30.0);
    glLight(GL_LIGHT1, GL_SPOT_EXPONENT, 80.0);</code></pre>

<p>With the change to <code>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</code>, I've widened the beam to twice
its original angle.  At the same time, I've told OpenGL to make it
quite a bit dimmer at the edges using <code>GL_SPOT_EXPONENT</code>, hopefully
hiding any jaggies.  The new parameter has a somewhat confusing name
that refers to the details of the equation that determines the
strength of the off-center dimming effect.  In a theme seen throughout
the mathematics of computer graphics, the dimming is a function of the
cosine of the angle between the center line and the vertex being lit.
In fact, the dimming factor is the cosine raised to the exponent
specified by <code>GL_SPOT_EXPONENT</code>.  Why use the cosine of the angle?
It turns out to be cheap to calculate--cheaper than calculating the
angle itself--and also gives a nice smooth effect.</p>

<p>With luck, the new beam will appear about the same width to the eye as
the old one:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step060.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>Good enough.  The image looks better without the massive performance
strain of high subdivision levels.</p>

<h3>Refactoring Drawing</h3>

<p>There's still something not right, but it will take a few more objects
in the scene to show it.  <code>draw_view</code> is already a repetitive
hardcoded mess and it's been on the &quot;to be refactored&quot; list for a
while, so now seems a good time to clean it up before I add to the
mess.</p>

<p><code>draw_view</code> performs a series of transformations and state settings
for each object drawn.  I want to move to a more data-driven design,
with each object in the simulated world represented by a data
structure specifying the needed transformations and settings.
Eventually, these structures may become full-fledged blessed objects,
but I'll start simple for now.</p>

<p>I initialized the data structures in <code>init_objects</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub init_objects
{
    my $self = shift;

    my @objects = (
        {
            draw        =&gt; \&amp;draw_axes,
        },
        {
            lit         =&gt; 1,
            color       =&gt; [ 1, 1,  1],
            position    =&gt; [12, 0, -4],
            scale       =&gt; [ 2, 2,  2],
            draw        =&gt; \&amp;draw_cube,
        },
        {
            lit         =&gt; 1,
            color       =&gt; [ 1, 1, 0],
            position    =&gt; [ 4, 0, 0],
            orientation =&gt; [40, 0, 0, 1],
            scale       =&gt; [.2, 1, 2],
            draw        =&gt; \&amp;draw_cube,
        },
    );

    $self-&gt;{world}{objects} = \@objects;
}</code></pre>

<p>Each hash includes the arguments to the various transformations to
apply to it, along with a reference to the routine that actually
draws the object and a flag indicating whether the object should be
subject to OpenGL lighting.  The object array then becomes a new part
of the world hash for easy access later.</p>

<p>I called this routine at the end of <code>init</code> as usual:</p>

<pre><code>    $self-&gt;init_objects;</code></pre>

<p>I also replaced <code>draw_view</code> with a version that interprets the data
into a series of OpenGL calls:</p>

<pre><code>sub draw_view
{
    my $self    = shift;

    my $objects = $self-&gt;{world}{objects};

    foreach my $o (@$objects) {
        $o-&gt;{lit} ? glEnable (GL_LIGHTING)
                  : glDisable(GL_LIGHTING);

        glColor(@{$o-&gt;{color}})        if $o-&gt;{color};

        glPushMatrix;

        glTranslate(@{$o-&gt;{position}}) if $o-&gt;{position};
        glRotate(@{$o-&gt;{orientation}}) if $o-&gt;{orientation};
        glScale(@{$o-&gt;{scale}})        if $o-&gt;{scale};

        $o-&gt;{draw}-&gt;();

        glPopMatrix;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>The new routine iterates over the world object array, performing each
requested operation.  It either skips or defaults any unspecified values.
First up is the choice to enable or disable <code>GL_LIGHTING</code>, followed
by setting the current color if requested.  The code next checks for and
applies the usual transformations and finally, calls the object draw
routine.</p>

<p>For simplicity and robustness, I've unconditionally wrapped the
transformations and draw routine in a matrix push/pop pair rather
than trying to detect whether they need the push and pop.  OpenGL
implementations tend to be highly optimized with native code, and any
detection I did would be Perl.  Chances are good that such an
&quot;optimization&quot; would instead slow things down.  This way, my code
stays cleaner and even a misbehaving draw routine that performed
transformations internally without cleaning up afterwards will not
affect the next object drawn.</p>

<p>A quick test showed that this refactored version still worked.  Now I
could add a few more objects to demonstrate the remaining lighting
issue.  I specified several more boxes programmatically by inserting a
new loop before the end of <code>init_objects</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    foreach my $num (1 .. 5) {
        my $scale =   $num * $num / 15;
        my $pos   = - $num * 2;
        push @objects, {
            lit         =&gt; 1,
            color       =&gt; [ 1, 1,  1],
            position    =&gt; [$pos, 2.5, 0],
            orientation =&gt; [30, 1, 0, 0],
            scale       =&gt; [1, 1, $scale],
            draw        =&gt; \&amp;draw_cube,
        };
    }

    $self-&gt;{world}{objects} = \@objects;
}</code></pre>

<p>For each box, just two parameters vary: position and Z scale.  I chose the
position to set each box next to the last, progressing along the -X axis.  The
scale is set so that the height and width of each box remains the same, but the
depths vary from very shallow for the first box to fairly deep for the
last.</p>

<p>The loop specifies five boxes in total and begins by calculating the X
position and Z scaling (depth) for the current box.  The next few
lines simply create a new hash for the new box and push it onto the
object array.</p>

<p>Finally, there was one last change--the bright world light overwhelms the
problematic effect from the flashlight.  This is an easy fix; I commented out
the line that enables it:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_world_lights
{
    glLight(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);

#     glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
}</code></pre>

<p>By panning to the left across the scene until the viewpoint is in
front of the new boxes, the problem becomes obvious:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step062.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>The brightness of the lighting varies immensely depending on the depth
of the box!  This rather unintuitive outcome is an unfortunate side
effect of how OpenGL must handle normals.  A normal specifies the
direction of the surface associated with a vertex.  If a rigid object
rotates, its surfaces rotate, so all of its normals must rotate as
well.  OpenGL handles this by transforming normal coordinates as it
would vertex coordinates.  This runs into trouble with any
transformations other than translation and rotation.  OpenGL
calculations assume that normals are normalized (have unit length).
Scaling the normal breaks this assumption and results in the effect
seen above.</p>

<p>To fix this, I told OpenGL that normals may not have unit length and that
OpenGL must normalize them before other calculations are performed.  This is
not the default behavior because of the performance cost of normalizing each
vector.  An application that can ensure normals are always unit length after
transformation can keep the default and run a little faster.  I want to allow
arbitrary scaling of objects, so I enabled automatic normalization with another
line at the end of <code>prep_frame</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    glEnable(GL_NORMALIZE);</code></pre>

<p>That fixed the problem:</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/02/17/graphics/step063.png" width="400" height="400" alt=""  /></p>

<p>With that bug killed, I reenabled the world light by uncommenting
the <code>glEnable</code> line in <code>set_world_lights</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sub set_world_lights
{
    glLight(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);

    glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
}</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>During this article I've moved pretty quickly, covering screenshots,
movement of the viewpoint, the beginnings of lighting in OpenGL, and
subdivided faces for the boxes.  Along the way, I took the chance to
refactor <code>draw_view</code> into a more data-driven design and made the
scene a little more interesting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these new changes have slowed things down quite a bit.  OpenGL
has several features that can improve performance considerably.  Next time, I'll
talk about one of the most powerful of these: display lists.  I'll also
introduce basic font handling and run with the performance theme by adding an
FPS display to the engine.</p>

<p>Until next time, have fun and keep hacking!</p>
