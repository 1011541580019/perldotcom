            <p>Welcome to yet another Perl Summary brought to you by music and pizza
(although the pizza is late in arriving). Like many summaries before it, we
start with an attempt at non sequitur and Perl 6 Language.</p>

<h3>Perl 6 Language</h3>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b3eee67e168e307c/1e865f9b0b1b2eec?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#1e865f9b0b1b2eec">Idiomatic
Perl 6</a></h4>

<p>St&eacute;phane Payrard expressed a desire for more Perl 6 sample code. Luke
Palmer issued the following, possibly foolish, response: "Post some 'how do I's...?' to the list, and I'll reply with code." Austin Hastings posed a couple, but
there's no response yet ...</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/7399190967f8b425/3ab0fa30a7a3c812?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#3ab0fa30a7a3c812">Generalized
Tainting</a></h4>

<p>Yuval Kogman posted an interesting musing about contagious properties (if
you pull a value from someone with a contagious property, the property comes
along, too). There were no responses, but it sounds interesting.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b60b94553109d196/c23ee29694e0cdf9?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#c23ee29694e0cdf9"><code>Stick</code>/<code>Pick</code></a></h4>

<p>Richard H. suggested a new pair of functions,
<code>stick</code>/<code>pick</code>, which would have modifiers such that
<code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code>,
and <code>splice</code> could all be calls to stick or pick with appropriate
modifiers. Unfortunately, I think he posted it to the Google Groups interface,
as it is there but not on the list. :-(</p>
<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/1424" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<h4><a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d31481c114e88a11/6fee65a60d6e190b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#6fee65a60d6e190b">Perl 6 IDE, Again</a></h4>

<p>Matisse Enzer re-raised the question of the feasibility of an IDE for Perl
6. Unfortunately, I think he re-raised it on Google Groups.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/96503cca52fd9c56/b335e917f3c0db0e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#b335e917f3c0db0e">1x6
vs. 6</a></h4>

<p>The dimension slice issues continue to grind with new suggestions from David
Green and Craig DeForest.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a2ddf112aa0bbf40/82e94fb1cfb404aa?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#82e94fb1cfb404aa">Lifespan of Loop Counters</a></h4>

<p>Joe Gottman wants an easy way to restrict the lifespan of his loop counter
to his loop. Some folks (myself included) did not like the answer of wrapping it
in a scope. Others (myself excluded) thought the answer "don't use
<code>loop</code>, use <code>for</code>" was a bit of a cop-out.</p>

<h4><a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c0aac33183670ccb/afb1c80562a9bf40?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#afb1c80562a9bf40"><code>Forany</code> &amp; <code>Forall</code></a></h4>

<p>Jonathan Lang wondered how to check if a condition is true for any element
of an array or for all elements. The answer is to use the aptly named junction
creators of <code>any()</code> and <code>all()</code>.</p>

<h3>Perl 6 Compiler</h3>

<p>I've already reached p6c with no pizza. :-( Ah well, it was a light week.</p>

<h3>Parrot Internals</h3>

<p>I've already reached p6i and still no pizza :-(. Although it was close,
after I wrote the <code>=head2</code> my door buzzed. It was just a locked-out
neighbor, but that would have been impressive timing.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/13efa03d11995889/fc4726ffd175662b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#fc4726ffd175662b"><em>Blib</em>
in 25 Seconds</a></h4>

<p>Peter Christopher asked for a 25-second summary of the <em>./blib</em>
directory.  Apparently this is harder than Hamlet in 30 seconds, which already
exists.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/144b250f3845ed3b/10ac67a3f6383aab?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#10ac67a3f6383aab">Searching
Archives</a></h4>

<p>Peter Christopher wanted to know if there was a way he could search the
mailing list archives. Steve Fink pointed him to groups.google.com and the ever-popular discussion topic "aardvarks."</p>

<h4>Dynclasses with External Dependencies</h4>

<p>Bernhard Schmalhofer wondered if there was a reasonable way to check for
external dependencies for dynamic PMCs that does not involve the core Parrot
configure step. Later he supplied a patch with his GDBMHash pmc, which
motivated the question. Leo applied it and hinted at a mythical multi-stage configure.</p>

<p>Bernhard Schmalhofer provided a patch, making the above cleanup all over.
Leo and Sam applied different parts of it.</p>

<h4>Black-ops Parrot</h4>

<p>Robert Spier posted a link to the new listing for Parrot on CIA.  Nicholas
Clark dove for cover.</p>

Problems on the Website</a></h4>

<p>Dave Brondsema noticed that PDDs 4-6 had not found their way to the website
properly. Will Coleda fired off a patch.</p>

<h4>Cleaning Old Tickets</h4>

<p>Will Coleda, in his never-ending role as RT janitor, closed out a few
obsolete tickets. Thanks, Will.</p>

and Timely Destruction</a></h4>

<p>Leopold Toetsch raised the recurring issue of timely destruction. It turns
out that timely destruction is hard. Various people made various suggestions.
Let me state one thing clearly as if I don't, Dan doubtless will: Parrot will
<em>not</em> use reference counting of any kind. There are a great many reasons
for this some of which Luke Palmer explained.</p>

Should Have Been <code>PMC*</code></a></h4>

<p>Peter Christopher provided a patch fixing a pointer declaration bug. Leo
applied it.</p>

for the Compiler FAQ</a></h4>

<p>Some time ago, a compiler FAQ started to contain answers to questions that
people posted to the list. Will Coleda posted two such questions, but there has
been no response.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1187c8a987294a13/7cc29b214379aff8?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#7cc29b214379aff8"><em>Languages/Perl6</em></a></h4>

<p>Will Coleda wondered what would come of the <em>languages/perl6</em> stuff
as PGE now has its own SVN repository. No one answered.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8b091009f3fc224d/1b000bb26d5cf99b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#1b000bb26d5cf99b">Parakeet
with Broken Wings</a></h4>

<p>Will added an RT ticket for Parakeet, which broke in a recent shuffle.</p>

Parrot</a></h4>

<p>Will found out that he could crash Parrot by doing stuff with GCed memory.
Leo admitted that he could.</p>

<h4>Collecting Academic Garbage</h4>

<p>Shevek asked for a good place to read about garbage collection
techniques. Garrett Goebel pointed him to just such a page.</p>

<p>Leo suggested a VTABLE change to facilitate MMD and method lookup.  The thread had several suggestions and questions.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/04/fowles">Food</a></h4>

<p>Matt Fowles's pizza arrived. The reader then speculated that either (he
writes slowly or it arrived quickly) or (he writes quickly or it arrived
slowly), depending on various readers' estimates of pizza-delivery time and
expected word-per-minute summarization.</p>

<p>Dan has returned to us. Hopefully he will be able to advance the quest for
meta-objects and interoperability.</p>

            <p>Imagine a city protected by a small army of soldiers. The city's future growth requires a larger force; so a few determined lieutenants go to nearby towns and enlist aid from their police departments. These forces will come to the
aid of the larger city when the time comes.</p>

<p>This is the Phalanx project, but the city is Perl, our soldiers are
automated tests, and the nearby towns are the modules of CPAN.</p>

<p>Flashback to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/">OSCON
2003</a>. Larry Wall had just given his <a
href="/pub/a/2003/07/16/soto2003.html">7th annual State of
the Onion</a> where he'd announced the <a
href="http://www.poniecode.org/">Ponie</a> project. Ponie is to be Perl 5.10,
but running on the new Parrot virtual machine that forms the basis of Perl 6,
instead of C.</p>

<p>I was talking with Leon Brocard about the massive amount of testing that
would be necessary to test a new implementation of Perl. Everything we know,
and all our assumptions, would change. How would we know that 2+2=4 all the
time? How would we know that object inheritance works? Will XS modules work the
way they should? We would need a huge test suite, more than Perl has now, to
make sure Ponie really is still Perl 5. The CPAN would make a great source of real-world testing.</p>
<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/1424" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<p>Most CPAN modules of any popularity come with a test suite, so it would be
easy to add more tests to the distributions. This would help those who worked
on Ponie to make sure they had more and more tests to test against, and would
help the module author by having more tests written for his code.</p>

<h2>Which Modules?</h2>

<p>I didn't imagine that we'd run Ponie against all of the CPAN, and wanted to
follow the Pareto principle and go after the top 10%. However, with CPAN at
about 4,000 modules when Phalanx started (now 6,000), it would have been too
large an effort to work on 400 modules. Instead, I picked a nice round 100, or
2.5% of the distributions available.</p>

<p>What makes a "top 100 module"? Ideally, I'd like to know which modules had
the most real-life use, but that's impossible. I decided a relative comparison
of the number of downloads of modules would be a close enough approximation.
(The astute reader is probably already thinking of problems with this approach,
but rest assured that I've thought of them as well.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/100/">Phalanx Top 100 Modules</a>
are those most downloaded in 45 days from the main CPAN mirror, with some
adjustments. I excluded search engine bots and anything that was apparently
mirroring CPAN. I also made the executive decision that any given IP address
that downloaded more then 450 modules in 45 days was a bot.</p>

<h2>Why the Name "Phalanx"?</h2>

<p>In ancient Greece, the phalanx was a military formation where hundreds of
soldiers formed a shield wall. Each man stood shoulder to shoulder with the men
next to him, their shields overlapping. As it is with the shields of the men in
the phalanx, it is with the numerous and overlapping tests of the Phalanx
project.</p>

<p>For any set of code, the more automated tests you have, the more protection
you have. If you can write a test for something, you probably should. Consider
these simple tests of a <code>Project</code> object's constructor and an
accessor, tested with Perl's testing framework:</p>

<pre><code>my $project = Project-&gt;new( name =&gt; "Phalanx" );
isa_ok( $project, "Project" );
is( $project-&gt;name, "Phalanx", "Name set correctly" );</code></pre>

<p>Some might say, "It's only an accessor, why should we test it?" It's worth
testing because when it doesn't work in production, you won't see the error at
the point of the accessor. Instead, some piece of code that uses the
<code>Project::name</code> accessor will fail, and you'll spend hours tracing
the failure back to the accessor.</p>

<p>This sort of approach -- strength in numbers, each test building on others --
was the basis of the phalanx. So, too, will it be with Perl's tests.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The primary goal of Phalanx is to increase the quality of a given module's
test suite, mostly by increasing the amount of the module's code that the tests
cover. However, there are secondary goals because we're working with the code
anyway.</p>

<p>The first sub-goal is to find hidden bugs. As we add tests to modules, we
hope to uncover broken functionality. Indeed, the team working on
HTML::TreeBuilder uncovered a bug in the module's code while they added
tests.</p>

<p>In addition to adding to the testing, team members should verify the code's
documentation and fill in any missing areas. Comparing code to inline
documentation may uncover hidden features that only someone reading the code
would know about. These should be documented and tested.</p>

<p>The principle here is this: Code, tests, and documentation must all agree with
each other. If the code does one thing, the documentation describes it
accurately, but the tests check for a different behavior, then there's a bug.
It might even be the two that agree with each other that are wrong. It's
possible even to find that all three might disagree with each other. Old code
can be like that sometimes.</p>

<p>Two other sub-goals are about humans. Phalanx provides an easy way for
people to wet their feet in the open source process. The very nature of Phalanx
is collaborative, where each team working on a module submits patches to the
module for review and approval. The module's author still maintains control,
but works with the team to decide what direction testing should take.</p>

<p>Second, Phalanx provides a playground for people with an interest in automated testing who don't know how or where to start. Like <a
href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/">chromatic</a>'s <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=perl+test+kata+site%3Aperl.com">Perl
testing kata</a>, adding tests to existing code actually exercises each team member's
skills.</p>

<h2>Getting People to Sign Up</h2>

<p>Once I'd created the Phalanx 100 and the guiding principles, and put up <a
href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/">the Phalanx website</a>, I had to find some
hoplites.  (Hoplites are the Greek soldiers that made up the ancient
phalanxes.) I announced the project and a dozen eager hoplites volunteered.
Each hoplite wrote to the author about his intent, to make sure the author was onboard with the idea. No sense in making changes and preparing patches for an author who will reject them. The author may also have input and suggestions, such as areas in the code that need more attention than others. Once the preparation was complete, the hoplite was to add tests and verify
documentation.</p>

<p>This process turned out to be a dismal failure.</p>

<p>Twelve different hoplites adopted 12 distributions and produced exactly zero
code in the first year. I don't mind pointing fingers, because I was one of the
12. It seems that on projects like this, working solo means motivation is hard
to maintain. Each of the hoplites I talked to explained that he started with
the best of intentions, but had trouble finding the time to follow through, and
the motivation fell by the wayside.</p>

<p>This year, I tried a different approach, enlisting the support of Perl Mongers groups, starting with my home group, Chicago.pm. I then took to the
conference circuit, giving lightning talks at YAPC::NA and OSCON asking for
interested parties to join up with the team. Since then, SouthFlorida.pm,
London.pm, and Perl Seminar New York have all joined up. We still coordinate with
the module author, and also report progress centrally at our new <a
href="http://phalanx.kwiki.org/">Phalanx wiki</a>, but now I hope that with a
group, it will be easier to keep motivation high.</p>

<h2>Phalanx Tools</h2>

<p>Over time, as we've built up an infrastructure for Phalanx, three tools have
proven themselves to be crucial to collaboration.</p>

<p>First were the triplets of email, web, and wiki, which allow information to be swapped on progress.  The
<a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-qa">perl-qa mailing
list</a> hosted at lists.perl.org is home to many Perl folks interested in
testing. The <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/">Phalanx webpage</a> lets me
post information for all hoplites to see. The <a
href="http://phalanx.kwiki.org/">Phalanx wiki</a> allows hoplites and groups to
post project progress.</p>

<p>Second, centralized
version control is crucial since we have multiple collaborators on an individual module,. Fortunately, Robert and Ask of perl.org are
graciously hosting a <a href="http://svn.perl.org/phalanx/">Subversion
repository for the Phalanx teams</a>.</p>

<p>Third, Paul Johnson's excellent <code>Devel::Cover</code> package has been
invaluable in identifying shortcomings of test suites.
<code>Devel::Cover</code> analyzes the running of the tests, and then
identifies which lines of code the suite has exercised or "covered." If a line
of code isn't covered by a test, it provides the hoplites a great place to
start, by writing a test case to exercise the uncovered code.</p>

<p><code>Devel::Cover</code> presents metrics on percentages of coverage, but
Phalanx doesn't try necessarily to increase coverage to 100%. We've found that
there's a level of diminishing returns when exercising extreme corner cases,
especially cases based on platform-specific dependencies. What we've found is
that the real value is finding the big areas of neglect and patching those up.
Sometimes you can even find big wins, like when I found unused and un-removed
code in <code>WWW::Mechanize</code>.</p>

<h2>How You Can Join</h2>

<p>If automated testing interests you, or you're looking for a way to add to the
CPAN, we'd love to have you join.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><em>Join the <a
href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-qa">perl-qa</a>
list.</em></p>

<p>The perl-qa list is the official mailing list of the Phalanx project. Sign
up and introduce yourself.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Find a module that interests you.</em></p>

<p>Find a module that could benefit from your attention. Many hoplites pick
modules that they use in day-to-day life. There's also no requirement that the
module you work on is from the Phalanx 100.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Find kindred souls.</em></p>

<p>Phalanx seems to go better when hoplites team up to work together.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You can (and should)  join our ranks and add to our numbers, as we help take Perl
that much closer to Perl 6.</p>

            <p>Welcome to another Perl 6 summary. This summary explores such thrilling
issues as multi-dimensional slices of Chinese food. After all, the amount of
sauce any piece of Chinese food can absorb is proportional to its surface area,
which is a direct function of the number of dimensions in which you slice it

<h4>Code as Comment</h4>

<p>St&eacute;phane Payrard wanted to know if there is an easy way to alias
arguments to a function, thus allowing a longer version for readability when
calling the function and a short version inside the function. Larry suggested
<code>$s is named&lt;subject&gt;</code>, which I like. The thread then devolved into

<h3>Perl 6 Compiler</h3>

<h4>Pascal -&gt; Pcode -&gt; Parrot -&gt; Profit</h4>

<p>Sven Schubert asked about the feasibility of putting Pascal on Parrot.  He
noted that with the infrastructure mentioned in "Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials,"
the problem would not be too bad. Apparently, "Essentials" makes a few promises
that we have yet to live up to, but we are working towards it. In the meantime, St&eacute;phane Payrard suggested a way for him to kill two birds with
one stone: Pcode.</p>

<p>Simon Glover asked why ResizablePMCArray was so different from all of its
Resizable*Array bretheren. The answer is that Leo improved it. This brings up
an obvious task for someone looking for a reasonably friendly chunk of Parrot
to work on. Rationalizing the implementation of the various Resizable*Arrays
would probably be a good task for a novice looking to dig into something.
Perhaps one who is on winter break...</p>

<h3>On Being Wrong</h3>

<p>When I decided to study computer science, I installed Linux on my computer
and bought a copy of "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie.  I
have been trying to solve software problems ever since. After much heartache, I
decided that if I was to continue programming I would have to come to terms
with being wrong, because I quickly discovered that being wrong is a big part
of the development cycle: you code, compile, view the errors, and then code
some more. I found it helpful to actually say "I am wrong" when the compiler
complained, to remind myself where the fault lay. It made finding problems a
lot easier when I accepted responsibility for the errors.</p>

<h3>Enjoy the Ride</h3>

<p>To deal with the frustration of constantly being wrong, I began to view
programming more as a game that I enjoyed than as an epic battle, and I started
looking at things from the compiler's perspective. This view has improved my
overall approach to software immensely. I was also fortunate to discover <em><a
href="http://www.perldebugged.com/">Perl Debugged</a></em> by Peter Scott and
Ed Wright. The authors provide a wealth of information about debugging and
testing Perl scripts, but they also emphasize that the right mental attitude is
often the key to a programmer's success. Basically, they say that you should
enjoy what you do.</p>

<p>Bugs come in many flavors, from syntax errors to errors of logic. Perl's
interpreter will catch most typos, especially if you <code>use warnings</code>,
but some can be tricky--and errors of logic are often even harder to tease
out.</p>

<p>Here is a common syntax error:</p>

<pre><code>if ($two_plus_two = 5) {
   print "two plus two is five"; 
} else {
   # I never seem to get here...
}</code></pre>

<p>Here is common logical error:</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>I know of software companies that let their customers find their bugs for
them.</li>

<li>These companies are worth millions of dollars.</li>

<li>If I let my customers find my bugs for me, I will be worth millions of
dollars.</li>

</ol>

<p>This particular error can lead to embarrassing code such as the
following:</p>

<pre><code>sub handle_error() {

print &lt;&lt;END;

   Dear Friend,
      We realize this may be a difficult time 
      for you, but there has been an SQL error. 
      Please email us for further assistance, 
      or try entering your obituary again. 
      Thank you. 

END
}</code></pre>
<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/970" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<p>Now, anyone who wants to sleep easy at night will want to avoid shameful
code like this, because slowly but surely, users are becoming less tolerant of
buggy code. If you haven't done so already, you will want to read through
Michael G. Schwern's <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Tutorial">Test::Tutorial</a> and get
started. Test-based development, combined with quality assurance, can enable a
company to offer its customers a rare and valuable commodity: reliable
software. In the future, the world of software may very well be divided between
the companies that incorporate testing into their development cycle and those
that used to be in business.</p>

<h3>Parts of a Test</h3>

<p>When the compiler stops complaining, many developers are happy to declare
victory and move on to the next project, but for the tester (often just the
developer with his hat on backwards), things are just becoming interesting.
Testers begin by breaking the program into sections, as Lydia Ash does in
<em><a
href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471430218.html">The
Web Testing Companion</a></em>. She notes the following five basic software
functions:</p>

<ol>

<li>Accepting input</li>
<li>Giving output</li>
<li>Saving data</li>
<li>Manipulating data</li>
<li>Removing data</li>

</ol>

<p>To begin testing, start at the top of the list and work down, one section at
a time. At this point in the process, you really understand why everyone always
tells you to write modular code. It is much easier to work through the list if
you've broken your program into the functions <code>get_input()</code>,
<code>display_members()</code>, <code>add_member()</code>,
<code>update_info()</code>, and <code>delete_member()</code>.</p>

<h3>Where to Look</h3>

<p>When asked where to look for bugs, software testers sometimes speak of the
"joints" between program components, "equivalence classes," and "edge values."
These are the primary points of weakness in an application.</p>

<p>An example of a joint is the place where your software interacts with a
third-party module. It's important to make sure that all of the components send
and receive what you think they should.</p>

<p>An equivalence class is a class of data that follows the same data path
through the program. Consider a program that divides the number 50 by whatever
number the user enters and either returns a positive integer or tells them why
the answer is not a positive integer. You might have the following classes:
negative numbers; the number zero; the numbers 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50; numbers
greater than 50; and non-numbers.  Consider the following incomplete but
well-intentioned code:</p>

<pre><code>sub factor_of_50 {
    my $divisor = shift;
    my $result  = 50 / $divisor;

    return $result if $result == int( $result );
    return "$divisor is negative" if $result &lt; 0;
    return "$result is not an integer";
}</code></pre>

<p>In this case, good tests should start with -1, 0, 1, 49, and 51, the edge
values for this program, to test the different paths through the code. Edge
values define the limits of the program, values near and past the stated
minimum and maximum that the program should handle. In the example above, you'd
also want to enter a string of letters and punctuation to see how the program
handles it. Then, compare the test results to the program's specification, which
tells you which inputs should work and what outputs the users should see.</p>

<h3>Specifications</h3>

<p>Any non-trivial program needs to have a specified list of what it should do.
This list of requirements lays a foundation on which to build the software and
against which testers can test.  There must be a specification of quality from
the beginning, or else there is no way to tell if the program has passed or
failed a given test. Functional specifications tell you about the program's
logic, while non-functional specifications include things like the speed of the
application, usability issues for a user interface, and security.</p>

<h3>Writing Tests</h3>

<p>Once you have a specification, you can make a test inventory--a list of all
the tests you need to write in order to prove that the software meets the
specifications. Of course, you need to eliminate all the bugs that crash the
program and as many more as you can find, but when do you say enough is
enough?</p>

<p>In <em><a
href="http://he-cda.wiley.com/WileyCDA/HigherEdTitle/productCd-047143020X,courseCd-CX4700.html">Software
Testing Fundamentals</a></em>, Marnie Hutcheson describes her Most Important
Tests method. This process tries to determine which tests will be most valuable
to run. Essentially, it is a way to present management with the opportunity to
weigh the tradeoffs between further testing and pushing the product to market
sooner.</p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>Reporting is, of course, crucial to testing. You test, trying to get the
software to fail, so that you can report the bugs you find back to the
development team, so they can fix things before the software's release. A
clear, informative bug report is the only one worth writing. Here is a template
for a web application's bug report from <em>The Web Testing Companion</em>.</p>

<p>SERVER CONFIG<br />
Operating System: &lt;Operating system and hardware, if applicable.&gt;<br />
Software Build: &lt;Build-number of your software.&gt;<br />
Topology: &lt;If you have multiple topologies where you test your
server in-house.&gt;</p>

<p>CLIENT<br />
OS: &lt;Operating system, service packs, and other dependent DLL versions, if applicable&gt;<br />
Browser: &lt;Browser and version&gt;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION<br />
&lt;Brief description of the problem&gt;</p>

<p>Repro (short for reproduction)</p>

<ol>

<li>&lt;Very descriptive steps showing how to recreate the problem&gt;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>

</ol>

<p>Result:<br />
&lt;Description of exactly what happens after the last repro step&gt;</p>

<p>Expected Results:<br />
&lt;Description of what should have happened after the last repro step&gt;</p>

<p>Notes:<br />
&lt;Add any information about when this was last verified or what
this might be related to here&gt;</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>When all the tests have finshed, the tester turns the repro reports in to
the development team and starts looking forward to the next project. If there
are any bugs found, the developer is back to square one: debugging. The process
has come full circle.  Hopefully, after a few more iterations, everyone can go
out and have a paintball war.</p>

<p>Software development and software testing require two different mindsets.
Sometimes it is hard for one person to switch back and forth between them, but
testing is essential to the success of any non-trivial software project in the
same way that editing is essential for any non-trivial writing project. Without
it, progress is ponderous, at best.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I'd like to list the nine debugging rules from David J.
Agans' excellent book, <em><a
href="http://www.debuggingrules.com/Debugging_CH1.PDF">Debugging</a></em>.  His
book clarifies these essential debugging concepts and is mandatory reading for
anyone who fixes things:</p>

<ol>

<li>Understand the system</li>
<li>Make it fail</li>
<li>Quit thinking and look</li>
<li>Divide and conquer</li>
<li>Change one thing at a time</li>
<li>Keep an audit trail</li>
<li>Check the plug</li>
<li>Get a fresh view</li>
<li>If you didn't fix it, it isn't fixed</li>

</ol>

<p>Welcome to a New Year of Perl 6 Summaries. I have been doing biweekly
summaries over the holiday season, but I plan on returning to weekly ones now.
Hopefully "World of Warcraft" won't prevent me, we shall see. But if anyone
starts a Perl guild, drop me a line. ;-)</p>

<h3>Perl 6 Language</h3>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d31481c114e88a11/d0f04d9a743aa82f?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#d0f04d9a743aa82f">Perl
IDE</a></h4>

<p>Matisse wondered if an IDE for Perl would be possible given its dynamic
nature. The consensus arrived at last time was that an IDE that worked for
"nice" code would be possible, but a fully general one would be extremely
difficult and quite possibly impossible.</p>
<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/1424" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6b65058e24a8ade6/22c37bb71487eedd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#22c37bb71487eedd">Premature
Optimization</a></h4>

<p>Jona... has a rant about low-level data types and premature optimizations.
So Google tells me, but I can't find it in my Gmail account... Perhaps he
posted directly to Google continuation enhanced arcs.  I wish people would not
do that....</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/412763eaeaf1bdc1/564a42de31ffddf5?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#564a42de31ffddf5">Strictness
of fully qualified globals</a></h4>

<p>Alexey Trofimenko wanted to know if Perl 6 would have a way to catch
mistakes like <code>$OtherPackage::NmaeWithTypo</code> when using strict.  The
thread seemed to wander off without answering his question, although it did
note that perhaps <code>OtherPackage::$NmaeWithTypo</code> would make more
sense.</p>

<h3>Perl 6 Compiler</h3>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/14f0b29da5bceea4/28126089cb1f7921?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#28126089cb1f7921">Using
ASCII 0 as a terminating character</a></h4>

<p>Nicholas Clark pointed out that Perl 5 allows the use of <code>\0</code> as
a quoting character for <code>q{}</code>. He felt that this was useful and
should remain in Perl 6. Patrick agreed.</p>

<h3>Parrot</h3>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5221412d6ef39e17/e49a3e8b266c5ef1?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#e49a3e8b266c5ef1">P5
was the new P2</a></h4>

<p>Last time, I reported that Sam and Leo wanted to pass P5 in P2 as well.  Sam
reported later that he was no longer confident in this idea. I guess I should de-nudge Dan....</p>

<h4><a

<p>Chromatic applied his previously threatened patch with a polite thanks to
himself.</p>

<h4><a

<p>Matt Diephouse noted that the error from reading past the EOF in PIR was not
really informative. Patches welcome.</p>

examples in PDD16</a></h4>

<p>Simon Glover noticed a section in PDD16 that just stops mid-sentence. He
suggested that it be either finished or removed. No answer...</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e169f5cdf871ab52/1723230e7dcbc8ac?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&amp;_doneTitle=Back&amp;&amp;d#1723230e7dcbc8ac">MMD
and <code>VTABLE_find</code></a></h4>

<p>Leo and Sam continued their discussion of how to implement MMD. The
conversations stopped, but I am not sure that it progressed. Perhaps some
guidance would be helpful...</p>

<h4><a

discussions</a></h4>

<p>A.M. Kuchling noted that PyCon will take place on March 23-25 in Washington, D.C. Many
folk will be there including the authors of IronPython and Jython. The deadline
for submissions was Dec. 31, 2004, but that does not mean that people cannot
attend, learn a whole bunch, and take over the world.</p>

<p>Will noted that <em>dynclasses/*py*</em> broke the build. Sam fixed it with
alacrity.</p>

<p>Adrian Lambeck provided a patch to make mod_parrot work with parrot-0.1.1.
Nicholas Clark applied it.</p>

<p>In my previous article, I provided <a
href="/pub/a/2004/10/28/bricolage_installation.html"
title="Installing Bricolage">a guided tour of the Bricolage installation
process</a>.  If you followed along, you should now have a nice, functioning
installation of Bricolage 1.8 all ready to go. But as <a
href="http://www.com-www.com/weirdal/mrpopeil.html" title="Mr. Popeil">Mr.
Popeil</a> used to say, <em>"But wait, there's more!"</em></p>

<p>Like many other applications, Bricolage comes with a runtime configuration
file. This file, named <em>bricolage.conf</em>, lives in the <em>conf</em>
subdirectory of your Bricolage root. It contains a list of settings that tell
Bricolage how to find things, how to connect to the database, which optional
features to include, and other good stuff. This article provides a guided tour
of all of the configuration settings in <em>bricolage.conf</em> to enable you
to configure things exactly the way you need them, so that you can manage your
sites more effectively with Bricolage.</p>

<h3><a id="configurationformat">Configuration Format</a></h3>

<p>The format of <em>bricolage.conf</em>, derived from the <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/" title="Perl Cookbook in the
O'Reilly Catalog"><q>Perl Cookbook</q></a>, is quite simple. A directive
appears on a single line, followed by a space, an equal sign, and then the
value. Anything after a pound sign (<q>#</q>) is a comment. Typical entries
look like this:</p>

<pre><code>APACHE_BIN   = /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
APACHE_CONF  = /usr/local/bricolage/conf/httpd.conf
LISTEN_PORT  = 80
SSL_PORT     = 443
SSL_ENABLE   = No</code></pre>

<p>Most <em>bricolage.conf</em> configuration options are one of two types:
Boolean values or strings. A Boolean configuration directive can be either
enabled or disabled, but you have several ways in which to do so.  To enable a
Boolean directive, simply set its value to <q>Yes</q>, <q>On</q>, or <q>1</q>
(the number one). To disable it, set it to <q>No</q>, <q>Off</q>, or <q>0</q>
(zero). String values follow the equal sign. They can be as long as necessary,
but cannot break across lines.</p>

<h3><a id="apacheconfiguration">Apache Configuration</a></h3>



<p>The first section of <em>bricolage.conf</em> configures Bricolage to use the
Apache web server. Because Bricolage runs on top of Apache but uses its own
startup scripts, it needs to know where to find Apache resources so that it can
configure and start Apache properly. Bricolage's default method of dynamically
configuring Apache therefore relies on these directives. The installation sets
many of them for you, but not all, so it's worth it to have a look to see if
you need to tweak any of them:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="apachebin"><code>APACHE_BIN</code></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This directive tells Bricolage where to find your Apache
<em>httpd</em> executable, which it uses to start itself up.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="apachecon"><code>APACHE_CON</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive points to the <em>httpd.conf</em> file. This, of course, is
the famous Apache configuration file. It, too, needs configuration to run
Bricolage (the Bricolage installer configures the default <em>httpd.conf</em>
in the <em>conf</em> subdirectory of your Bricolage root directory), and
Bricolage, in turn, uses this directive to tell <em>httpd</em> where to find
the configuration file when it starts up.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="listenport"><code>LISTEN_PORT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the TCP/IP port on which Bricolage will listen for requests. It uses
the HTTP standard port 80 by default, but you can <a
href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/howtos/2004/04/19/virtual_host_config/"
title="How to run Bricolage on a Virtual Host and on Non-Standard Ports">change
Bricolage to use another port</a> if you already have another server listening
on port 80.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="sslport"><code>SSL_PORT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the TCP/IP port on which Bricolage will listen for secure sockets
layer (SSL) requests. It defaults to the standard HTTP SSL port 443, but again,
you can change it to another port if something else is already using port 443.
SSL is disabled by default, however, so read on for details on how to turn it
on.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="sslenable"><code>SSL_ENABLE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive turns on SSL support. You must have either
<code>mod_ssl</code> or Apache-SSL installed and properly configured in your
Apache server. Not quite a Boolean configuration directive, the possible values
for <code>SSL_ENABEL</code> are <q>No</q> (or <q>Off</q> or <q>0</q> [zero]),
<q>mod_ssl</q>, or <q>apache-ssl</q>. SSL is a useful feature for keeping
communications encrypted between the server and users' browsers.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="alwaysusessl"><code>ALWAYS_USE_SSL</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>By default, an SSL-enabled Bricolage installation uses SSL only for logging
in to Bricolage and in the user profile (where users can change their
passwords). Users can elect to encrypt all communications by checking the
<q>Always use SSL</q> checkbox when logging in, but some security policies may
require the encryption of <em>all</em> communications. In such cases, enable
this Boolean directive to force the encryption of <em>all</em> communications
between the Bricolage server and users' browsers.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="sslcertificatekeyfile"><code>SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE</code></a></dt>
<dt><a id="sslcertificatefile"><code>SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>These directives specify the location of your SSL keys. If you've configured
<code>mod_ssl</code> or Apache-SSL, you should already be familiar with these
files. They help to encrypt and decrypt requests between the server and the
browser. If you use <code>make certificate</code> to generate your SSL
certificate during the Apache build process, by default your server key file
will be <em>server.key</em> in the <em>conf/ssl.key</em> subdirectory of your
Apache root directory, while the server public key file will be
<em>server.crt</em> and in the <em>conf/ssl.crt</em> subdirectory. Bricolage
uses these directives to set the Apache <code>SSLCertificateKeyFile</code> and
<code>SSLCertificateFile</code> directives, respectively, in its dynamic
configuration of Apache.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="namevhost"><code>NAME_VHOST</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive roughly corresponds to the Apache <em>httpd.conf</em>
<code>NameVirtualHost</code> directive. Set it to the IP address on which the
Bricolage Apache server will listen for requests. If you have only one IP
address on your server, the simplest thing to do is to leave this directive set
to <q>*</q>, which applies to all IP addresses. Again, Bricolage uses this
directive in its dynamic configuration of Apache.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="vhostservername"><code>VHOST_SERVER_NAME</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the virtual host name under which to run Bricolage.  Bricolage
requires a full host or virtual host to run and will use this directive to
configure the virtual host dynamically. Leave it set to <q>_default_</q> to use
the default host name set in your <em>httpd.conf</em> file.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="manualapache"><code>MANUAL_APACHE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<!-- prod: intertextual link here; please verify across pages -->

<p>Bricolage uses Apache::ReadConfig to configure the httpd daemon.  There is
no <em>httpd.conf</em> include file. If you want to take control of your
Bricolage Apache server by manually configuring it, enable this Boolean
directive. It will generate a file, <em>bric_httpd.conf</em>, in the
<em>bricolage</em> subdirectory of your temporary directory (see the <a
href="#tempdir">TEMP_DIR</a> directive for the location of the temporary
directory). This file will contain all of the Apache configuration directives
that Bricolage uses to configure Apache dynamically. Restarting Bricolage will
rewrite this file, but if you want to use it and edit it manually, copy it to
the <em>conf</em> subdirectory of your Bricolage root directory, disable the
<code>MANUAL_APACHE</code> directive, and then change the section of the
<em>httpd.conf</em> file that configures Bricolage from:</p>

<pre><code>PerlPassEnv BRICOLAGE_ROOT
PerlModule Bric::App::ApacheConfig</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>Include /usr/local/bricolage/conf/bric_httpd.conf
PerlPassEnv BRICOLAGE_ROOT
PerlModule Bric::App::ApacheStartup</code></pre>

<p>Here <em>/usr/local/bricolage/conf/bric_httpd.conf</em> is the full path
name to the newly generated <em>bric_httpd.conf</em> file. You can now tweak
this file to your heart's content. Just be sure to generate a new one after
each upgrade of Bricolage, as certain directives may change between
releases.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="sysuser"><code>SYS_USER</code></a></dt>
<dt><a id="sysgroup"><code>SYS_GROUP</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>These directives configure the system user and group used by Bricolage. They
should contain the same value as the <code>User</code> and <code>Group</code>
<em>httpd.conf</em> directives, usually <q>nobody</q> or <q>www</q>. Any files
written to the file system by Bricolage will be owned by this user and
group.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a id="databaseconfiguration">Database Configuration</a></h3>

<p>The next major section of the Bricolage configuration file configures the
database. Bricolage uses PostgreSQL 7.3 or later for its data store. Connecting
to that database requires several attributes, not least of which are the
username and password.  These are all set during installation, but it's worth
being familiar with them in case things change down the line.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="dbname"><code>DB_NAME</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The name of the database that stores Bricolage's data. The installer will
set this for you. The default value, <q>bric</q>, works well in most
situations, but it might be set to a different name if you entered one during
installation, perhaps because you already had another database named
<q>bric</q>; Why would you want to do that? Perhaps you have multiple Bricolage
installations on the same host. Another reason it might be different is that
your ISP provides you with a single database that they name according to their
own naming conventions. At any rate, you're unlikely to need to change the
value of this directive.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="dbuser"><code>DB_USER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The username that Bricolage will use when connecting to the database. Again,
you are unlikely to need to change this directive, especially because, when
Bricolage creates the database, it specifically assigns permissions for this
user to access the appropriate tables, sequences, and such. Note that, for
security reasons, you should <em>never</em> use the PostgreSQL superuser for
this directive.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="dbpass"><code>DB_PASS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The password for the <code>DB_USER</code> to use to connect to the
PostgreSQL database. You'll need to change this directive if the password ever
changes in the database.  Depending on your PostgreSQL server's security model,
it might not matter what the password is. For example, if the PostgreSQL is on
the same host as your Bricolage server and trusts local users (the default
configuration), it will ignore the password. Consult your PostgreSQL <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/client-authentication.html"
title="Documentation for PostgreSQL Client Authentication">authentication
settings</a> (in the server's <em>pg_hba.conf</em> file) or check with your
PostgreSQL DBA if you have questions.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="dbhost"><code>DB_HOST</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the host name of your PostgreSQL server. If it's on the same host as
your Bricolage server, it will likely be commented out, thereby letting
Bricolage default to <q>localhost</q>.  Otherwise, it will be a different host
name or IP address.  Change this setting if ever your PostgreSQL server moves
to a different host or has its host name or IP address changed.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="dbport"><code>DB_PORT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The TCP/IP port on which your PostgreSQL server listens for connections.
This directive will be commented out if you've installed PostgreSQL locally and
you're using Unix sockets instead of TCP/IP for its connectivity (a good idea
for security-conscious environments). It will also be commented out if
Bricolage should use the default PostgreSQL port of 5432.  Otherwise, if
Bricolage must connect to the PostgreSQL server via TCP/IP on a port other than
5432, set this directive to the appropriate port number.</p>

</dd>
</dl>













<h3><a id="directorysettings">Directory Settings</a></h3>

<p>Bricolage stores a lot of files on your server's file system, generally in
well-named directories below your Bricolage root directory. Sometimes you may
want them installed elsewhere, perhaps for the purposes of conserving disk
space or distributing I/O between different partitions. If you want to move any
of these directories to a location other than that set by the installer, copy
over any existing files to ensure that Bricolage continues to operate
correctly.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="tempdir"><code>TEMP_DIR</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage creates several temporary files as it runs, for its cache, user
sessions, and the like. If you selected the <q>multi</q> option when installing
Bricolage, this directive will point to a directory named <em>tmp</em> under
your Bricolage root. Otherwise, it will point to your system's global
<em>tmp</em> directory.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="masoncomproot"><code>MASON_COMP_ROOT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The Bricolage UI uses <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/" title="Mason
HQ">HTML::Mason</a>. All of the components to power the UI live in this
directory, generally a subdirectory of your Bricolage root named <em>comp</em>.
However, media files uploaded to Bricolage also go in this directory, which
means that it can become quite large if you manage a lot of media documents. It
might be useful, therefore, to move this directory to a separate partition.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="masondataroot"><code>MASON_DATA_ROOT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Mason compiles the Bricolage UI components into object files and stores them
in this directory. For the most part you don't need to worry about where these
files live (the default is the <em>data</em> directory under the Bricolage root
directory), although Bricolage will read from it quite a lot as it loads the
object files into memory, so disk I/O is important. It's unlikely to grow too
except...</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="burnroot"><code>BURN_ROOT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive tells Bricolage where to store formatting templates, object
files, and burned files that are ready for distribution. As such, it can also
grow quite large, especially if you've published or previewed a lot of
documents. Bricolage never deletes these files so that you always have a
canonical directory of the distribution files output by Bricolage. However, the
default location for the <code>BURN_ROOT</code> is under the directory
specified by the <code>MASON_DATA_ROOT</code> directive.  If you encounter disk
space problems, you might want to move this directory to another partition.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a id="xml::writerconfiguration">XML::Writer Configuration</a></h3>

<p>The Bricolage Mason burner is responsible for pushing documents through
Mason formatting templates. If you're writing templates that output XML (and
I'll demonstrate writing templates in a later article, so hang in there!), you
might want to simplify things by using an <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Writer/" title="XML::Writer on
CPAN">XML::Writer</a> object to generate the XML.  Bricolage simplifies things
by providing these directives to create a globally available XML::Writer object
for use in all Mason templates.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="includexmlwriter"><code>INCLUDE_XML_WRITER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Enable this Boolean directive to tell Bricolage to create an XML::Writer
object that's globally available as <code>$writer</code> to all Mason
templates. Bricolage is smart enough to configure the XML::Writer object to
output XML to Mason's buffer, so that you can even mix standard Mason output in
your templates with XML::Writer output.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="xmlwriterargs"><code>XML_WRITER_ARGS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Use this directive to specify a list of options to pass to the XML::Writer
constructor when <code>INCLUDE_XML_WRITER</code> is enabled. This directive is
a string containing a Perl expression to pass to XML::Writer. The <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Writer/Writer.pm#Writing_XML" title="Read
the XML::Writer documentation on CPAN">XML::Writer documentation</a> has the
full list of possible parameters.  Common parameters include
<code>NEWLINES</code> to trigger the output of new lines between XML elements,
and <code>DATA_INDENT</code> to indent nested XML elements by a certain number
of characters.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a id="authenticationconfiguration">Authentication Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Several configuration directives affect the behavior and security of the
Bricolage authentication system. Bricolage handles its own authentication,
storing passwords in the database as MD5-encrypted hashes and recording
authentication in a browser cookie. In a security-conscious environment, it
pays to be familiar with these directives and even to review their settings
periodically.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="authttl"><code>AUTH_TTL</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive specifies the time-to-live, in seconds, for an authentication
session. Each time an authenticated user sends a request to the server, the
elapsed time resets to zero. You could therefore set <code>AUTH_TTL</code> to
3600 seconds for a one-hour time-to-live, and a user would be able to use
Bricolage all day, as long as each request was less than an hour apart (but she
might have to re-authenticate after lunch). This directive is especially useful
in environments where users access Bricolage from public workstations and
forget to log out. The default value of 28800 (eight hours) is probably too
long in a production environment.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="authsecret"><code>AUTH_SECRET</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage stores the user authentication session locally and keys it off of
an MD5 string stored in a browser cookie. The MD5 string comes from the
browser's IP subnet, the expiration time, the user name, and the last access
time. Because such a string is potentially replicable by someone trying to
crack the system, Bricolage also uses a random string of characters to salt the
MD5 string. <code>AUTH_SECRET</code> is the string used for this purpose. The
installer generates it for you, but you might want to change it now and then,
in order to keep it random and meet the specifications of your security policy.
All users will need to re-authenticate after you change
<code>AUTH_SECRET</code> and restart Bricolage.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="loginlength"><code>LOGIN_LENGTH</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive specifies a minimum user name length. Each user must have a
user name of at least this number of characters.  The default, <q>5</q>, is
generally adequate, and allows the default <q>admin</q> user name to work
properly.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="passwdlength"><code>PASSWD_LENGTH</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive corresponds to the <code>LOGIN_LENGTH</code> directive, but
applies to passwords. The password length in Bricolage is unlimited, but it's
generally a good idea to ensure that they all contain a minimum number of
characters. The default is <q>5</q>.</p>

<h3><a id="distributionconfiguration">Distribution Configuration</a></h3>

<p>When Bricolage previews or publishes documents, it pushes them through
formatting templates (written in Mason, Template Toolkit, or HTML::Template)
and writes the resulting files to disk. It then distributes those files to the
appropriate servers specified in the destination manager in the user interface.
(A later article will explain more of the Bricolage administrative interface.)
Many run-time configuration directives affect the behavior of the Bricolage
distribution server.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="enabledist"><code>ENABLE_DIST</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<!-- prod: intertextual link here; please verify across pages -->

<p>This Boolean directive enables Bricolage distribution. The only reason to
disable distribution is if you set up a separate distribution server. To my
knowledge, no one has actually done this, even though Bricolage supports it.
The <a href="#queuepublishjobs">QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS</a> directive is more
popular to reduce Bricolage server overhead.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="distattempts"><code>DIST_ATTEMPTS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage distributes files via file system copy, FTP, SFTP, or
WebDAV&#x2014;depending on your destination configuration. We all know that
failures can occasionally occur. Bricolage will attempt to distribute a file
after a failed distribution and will do it multiple times. Set the
<code>DIST_ATTEMPTS</code> directive to the number of times it should attempt
to distribute a file before giving up.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="previewlocal"><code>PREVIEW_LOCAL</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This Boolean directive enables Bricolage's internal preview server. This is
just a URI in the Bricolage UI that knows to serve previewed content rather
than the UI. This is handy for evaluating Bricolage, but be sure to disable it
in a production environment, especially if your front-end server needs to serve
something other than static HTML. The recommended approach is to set up a
separate preview server that is identical to your production server and
configure a destination to distribute and redirect previews to that server.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="previewmason"><code>PREVIEW_MASON</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>With the <code>PREVIEW_LOCAL</code> directive enabled, if the content you're
generating includes Mason calls, you can enable this boolean directive to make
Bricolage's internal preview server evaluate the Mason code before serving
documents.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="defmediatype"><code>DEF_MEDIA_TYPE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This string directive identifies the default media type (also called a
<q>MIME type</q>) of files for which Bricolage cannot determine the media type.
The default value, <q>text/html</q>, covers a lot of typical files in a Web
content management environment, such as <em>.php</em> or <em>.jsp</em> files.
To add new types for Bricolage to recognize, use the media type manager in the
UI.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="enablesftpmover"><code>ENABLE_SFTP_MOVER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>By default, Bricolage does not support distribution via secure FTP (SFTP). If
you need it, install the required Net::SFTP module, enable this directive, and
restart Bricolage.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="sftphome"><code>SFTP_HOME</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>If you've enabled SFTP distribution, use this directive specify a home
directory for SFTP to use, especially if you want to use public and private SSH
keys. Consult the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/net-SFTP/"
title="Net::SFTP on CPAN">Net::SFTP</a> documentation for details.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="enablesftpv2"><code>ENABLE_SFTP_V2</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Enable this directive to prefer SSH2 support for SFTP distribution. You'll
also need to install more Perl modules from CPAN. Consult the Net::SFTP
documentation for details.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="sftpmovercipher"><code>SFTP_MOVER_CIPHER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Net::SFTP uses the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-SSH-Perl/"
title="Net::SSH::Perl on CPAN">Net::SSH::Perl</a> module to handle the SSH side
of things. This module supports multiple encryption ciphers. If you prefer one,
specify it via this directive.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="enablewebdavmover"><code>ENABLE_WEBDAV_MOVER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage also supports distribution via <a href="http://www.webdav.org/"
title="WebDav Resources">WebDAV</a>, a standard for distributing documents via
the HTTP protocol. DAV, as it is also known, has support in multiple web
servers including Microsoft's IIS and Apache 2. If you'd like to distribute
document files to your production server or servers via DAV, install the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-DAV/" title="HTTP::DAV on
CPAN">HTTP::DAV</a> module, enable this Boolean directive and restart
Bricolage.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="queuepublishjobs"><code>QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>By default, when a user schedules a document to publish immediately, the
Bricolage server will immediately execute the distribution. If users publish a
lot of documents or you're bulk publishing large sections of your site at once,
this can really slow down the Bricolage UI for other users. This is even true
even if you've scheduled a bulk of documents to publish at a future date and
time, because the way the default <em>bric_dist_mon</em> script works is to
tickle the Bricolage server to distribute documents.</p>

<p>The way around this problem is to enable the <code>QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS</code>
boolean directive and then use the <em>bric_queued</em> program instead of
<em>bric_dist_mon</em>.  With <code>QUEUE_PUBLISH_JOBS</code> enabled, the
Bricolage server will <em>never</em> burn and distribute documents, even if a
user schedules them to publish <em>yesterday</em>. Instead,
<em>bric_queued</em> handles all of the burning and distribution itself,
without having the Bricolage server expend resources on the task. With this
approach, be sure to run <em>bric_queued</em> from a fairly aggressive cron
job.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="ftpunlinkbeforemove"><code>FTP_UNLINK_BEFORE_MOVE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>When Bricolage distributes files via FTP, it uploads them with a temporary
file name, and then, when the transfer is complete, it renames the file to the
final name. However, if an earlier version of the file is already present, the
rename might fail. (This depends on your FTP server, but Microsoft's IIS is the
server that led us to add this feature.) In such a case, enable this directive
and Bricolage will delete any existing instance of the file before renaming the
temporary file.</p>

<h3><a id="alertconfiguration">Alert Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Bricolage has an interface for sending alert emails when it logs events that
meet certain criteria against objects. Bricolage needs to know a few things
before it can send the alerts.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="smtpserver"><code>SMTP_SERVER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage uses an SMTP server to send alert email messages. The default
value for this directive, <q>localhost</q>, is fine if you use a Unix system
with sendmail (or some other SMTP server) running locally. If your organization
has a dedicated SMTP server or if your Bricolage host has none of its own,
change the value of this directive.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="alertfrom"><code>ALERT_FROM</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Set this directive to an email address that you want to appear in the
<q>From</q> header of alert emails. I typically set it to something like
<q>Bricolage Admin &lt;www@example.com&gt;</q>, but use whatever is appropriate
for your organization.  If your users are inclined to reply to alert emails,
you may want to set up a special <code>ALERT_FROM</code> email address that has
an auto-responder to let the user know that the reply will go unread.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="alerttometh"><code>ALERT_TO_METH</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This string directive indicates which header to use for specifying alert
recipients in email alerts. The possible values are <q>To</q> and
<q>Bcc</q>.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="userinterfaceconfiguration">User Interface Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Some configuration directives enable you to affect how the Bricolage user
interface works in subtle ways. If you haven't used the Bricolage browser-based
interface much yet, some of these won't make much sense just now. Feel free to
come back and look again when you're you've had some experience with the
Bricolage interface and want to make it behave more according to your own
notions of correctness.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="fullsearch"><code>FULL_SEARCH</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>By default, when you search for objects in the Bricolage admin interfaces,
or for stories, media, or templates in the asset library, the Bricolage UI
appends a wildcard character to the end of your search string. Thus if you
search for <q>foo</q>, the search will return results for all records that
<em>start with <q>foo</q></em>. If, however, you set the
<code>FULL_SEARCH</code> Boolean directive to a true value, all searches in the
Bricolage UI will become substring searches. So a search for <q>foo</q> will
return all records where <q>foo</q> appears anywhere in a record.</p>

<p>The downside to this approach is that it prevents PostgreSQL from using its
database indexes. In principal, this is only a problem if you have a large
number of objects in Bricolage. If, say, you had 100,000 stories in Bricolage,
you would notice that story searches would be noticeably slower with
<code>FULL_SEARCH</code> enabled than with it disabled. Leave it disabled if
you expect to manage a lot of documents. Your users can always manually prepend
the wildcard character (<q>%</q>) to the front of search queries if they want a
substring search.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="allowworkflowtransfer"><code>ALLOW_WORKFLOW_TRANSFER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage workflows are made up of a series of desks. In general, workflows
have their own desks, but desks can appear in more than one workflow. In such a
case, documents moved to such a shared desk in one workflow will be visible on
the same desk in another workflow. This is great for managing common tasks
across workflows, such as translation or legal review.  The upshot is that, by
default, a document placed on a desk in one workflow cannot be transferred from
that desk to another desk in a different workflow.  Users can only move it to
other desks in the workflow in which it originated.  Set the
<code>ALLOW_WORKFLOW_TRANSFER</code> Boolean directive to a true value to
remove this constraint, so that a document placed on a desk in one workflow can
be moved from that desk to other desks in other workflows that the desk is
in.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="allowallsitescx"><code>ALLOW_ALL_SITES_CX</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>When managing multiple sites in Bricolage, the user interface will display a
<q>site context</q> select list. Only the workflows for the selected site will
be displayed. If you want to allow users to see all of the workflows for all of
the sites that they have permission to access, set this Boolean directive to a
true value to add an <q>All Sites</q> option to the <q>Site context</q> select
list. But beware! If you have access to a lot of sites, you'll have access to a
bewildering number of workflows when you select this option!</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="yearspanbefore"><code>YEAR_SPAN_BEFORE</code></a></dt>
<dt><a id="yearspanafter"><code>YEAR_SPAN_AFTER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>For the input of dates in Bricolage, the user interface offers select lists
for the day, month, and year. By default, the years available in the
<q>Year</q> select list have a limit of the ten years before and after the
value for the year or the current year.  If you need more years in your select
list, set these directives to the number of years before and after the current
value or current year. For example, if you manage a site of historical
photographs with Bricolage, you might need to select years that range back over
100 years. In such a case, set <code>YEAR_SPAN_BEFORE</code> to <q>100</q>. A
science fiction book review site, on the other hand, might need years much
farther in the future. For such a case, set <code>YEAR_SPAN_AFTER</code> to the
appropriately high number.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="defaultfilename"><code>DEFAULT_FILENAME</code></a></dt>
<dt><a id="defaultfileext"><code>DEFAULT_FILE_EXT</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The file names generated for story documents are set on a per-output channel
basis. The user interface offers default values for these settings in the
output channel profile. The default file name is <q>index</q>, and the default
file name suffix is <q>html</q>. If, say, you were outputing content to an IIS
server, you might want to set the <code>DEFAULT_FILENAME</code> directive to
<q>default</q> and the <code>DEFAULT_FILE_EXT</code> directive to <q>htm</q>,
instead. It's not a big deal either way, though, because you can actually set
the values you need for each output in the user interface. These are just the
displayed defaults, settable as directives for the ultimate in laziness.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="enableocassetassociation"><code>ENABLE_OC_ASSET_ASSOCIATION</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Document models are associated with output channels in Bricolage. When you
create a new document based on a model, it will automatically have the output
channel associations defined by the model. If you'd like users to be able to
change the associations&#x2014;say, to assign output channels defined by the
model to be optionally associated with documents based on that model&#x2014;set
this directive to a true value. If, however, the added complexity of output
channel associations will only confuse your users, set this directive to a
false value to remove the user interface for changing document output channel
associations.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="enablecategorybrowser"><code>ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>When editing a story document in Bricolage, you'll see a select list of all
categories that you have READ permission to access to allow you to optionally
add the story to a new category. Most of the time, however, you'll only add a
story to one or two categories, and then never change these settings.
Therefore, if you have a lot of categories in your Bricolage installation (and
there are systems in production with over 2000 categories), it's wasteful to
load them all every time you edit a story document when you'll never change
them again.</p>

<p>In such a case, set the Boolean <code>ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER</code>
directive to a true value and restart Bricolage. This will change the story
profile to offer a link to a category browser, which enables you to search for
the category or categories to associate with a story. Now, not only will you no
longer load all categories every time you access the story profile (and the
story profile is, for content producers, the most commonly accessed page in the
Bricolage UI), but you'll only load those you search for in the category
browser. I highly recommend that every Bricolage admin to set this directive to
a true value.</p>

<h3><a id="documentmanagementconfiguration">Document Management
Configuration</a></h3>

<p>These directives relate to how Bricolage manages documents.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="publishrelatedassets"><code>PUBLISH_RELATED_ASSETS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage allows you to create relationships between documents.  These can
point to <q>related stories</q> or add images to a document, among other
things. By default, when you publish a document, Bricolage will also try to
publish any related documents. This will help to prevent 404s or broken image
problems.  In some cases, you might not want this behavior, so set the
<code>PUBLISH_RELATED_ASSETS</code> Boolean directive to a false value.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="storyuriwithfilename"><code>STORY_URI_WITH_FILENAME</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Story documents in Bricolage must have unique URIs. URIs consist of a
story's category and optionally other parts of the story, such as its cover
date and its slug (a one-word description of a story). They do not, however,
consist of the file name. This is in keeping with W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html" title="&#x201c;Cool URIs don't
change&#x201c;, by Tim Berners-Lee">suggestions</a>.  The idea is that the
story has a directory URI, and there may be several forms of the story with
different file names in that directory, such as <q>index.html</q> for HTML,
<q>rdf.xml</q> for RDF, and <q>index.pdf</q> for PDFs.</p>

<p>However, some organizations have Website policies that demand the inclusion
of file names in the URI. This is so that different documents can be in the
same directory. A common example might be a <q>About Us</q> directory with
separate <q>/about/index.html</q>, <q>/about/contact.html</q>, and
<q>/about/copyright.html</q> documents. Such URIs are not possible by default
in Bricolage, which requires that all stories have unique URIs, because each of
these stories would have the same URI, namely <q>/about</q>. To get around this
issue, set the <code>STORY_URI_WITH_FILENAME</code> Boolean directive to a true
value. From then on, all stories will include their file names in their URIs.
Be careful, though! Existing stories will not have their URIs changed.  Decide
how you want to set this directive when you start using Bricolage, and never
change it.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="allowsluglessnonfixed"><code>ALLOW_SLUGLESS_NONFIXED</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The URIs for story documents are determined by patterns specified on a
per-output channel basis. There are two different URI formats in each output
channel, one for fixed documents and one for non-fixed documents. Non-fixed
documents typically use parts of the cover date in their URIs, while fixed URIs
do not. Each document model has a flag set to indicate whether documents based
on the model will use the fixed for non-fixed URI patterns. The result is that,
for non-fixed stories, you might have URIs like
<q>/reviews/books/2004/12/23/princess_bride</q>. Here the URI format includes
the slug, a one-word summary of the contents of a story (the
<q>princess_bride</q> part of this example). However, slugs are optional in
stories, even non-fixed stories. If you want to force all non-fixed stories to
include the slug in order to guarantee the creation of more meaningful URIs,
set this Boolean directive to a true value.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="autogenerateslug"><code>AUTOGENERATE_SLUG</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This Boolean directive complements the <code>ALLOW_SLUGLESS_NONFIXED</code>
directive. If you want to keep the slug optional but generate one when a user
neglects to type one in, set <code>AUTOGENERATE_SLUG</code> to a true value.
This will cause Bricolage to generate a simple slug based on the title of the
story. For example, a story with the title <q>Essential Perl 6</q> would have
the slug <q>essential_perl_6</q> generated for it.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="apache::sizelimitconfiguration">Apache::SizeLimit
Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Bricolage is a large application that includes many CPAN modules as well as
its own 120,000+ lines of code. When you start it up, its processes can take up
30MB of memory or more. In general this isn't a problem, because Apache shares
that memory between child processes. As each process handles requests, however,
its size can swell independent of other processes. If you're performing
resource intensive activities, such as publishing a lot of documents at once,
the process that handles the request can become quite large. Because Perl (and,
by extension, <code>mod_perl</code>) does not return memory to the system, this
can give the appearance that you have a memory leak.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is to use the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/mod_perl-1.29/lib/Apache/SizeLimit.pm"
title="Apache::SizeLimit on CPAN">Apache::SizeLimit</a> module distributed with
<code>mod_perl</code> to check your <code>mod_perl</code> processes
periodically and kill them when they exceed a certain size. Bricolage has
integrated support for Apache::SizeLimit that these directives can quickly
enable and configure.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="checkprocesssize"><code>CHECK_PROCESS_SIZE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This Boolean directive turns on the Apache::SizeLimit support.  After you
set it to a true value and restart Bricolage, it will use the settings in the
following directives to decide how often to check your processes and to kill
them when they get to be too big.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="maxprocesssize"><code>MAX_PROCESS_SIZE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This is the maximum size, in bytes, that processes can reach before
Apache::SizeLimit will kill them.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="checkfrequency"><code>CHECK_FREQUENCY</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive determines how often Apache::SizeLimit will check the size of
your <code>mod_perl</code> processes. If you set it to <q>5</q>, it will check
a process after every fifth request handled by that process. The default is
<q>1</q>.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="minsharesize"><code>MIN_SHARE_SIZE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive indicates the minimum amount of shared memory the process
must employ to avoid being considered a candidate for termination. Consult the
Apache::SizeLimit documentation for more information. The default is <q>0</q>,
meaning that all Apache <code>mod_perl</code> processes will have their sizes
checked.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="maxunsharedsize"><code>MAX_UNSHARED_SIZE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive sets a limit on the amount of unshared memory a process may
consume to not be a candidate for termination. You can use this directive to
tweak your settings if you find that Apache::SizeLimit terminates processes
while they are still mainly using shared memory. The default is <q>0</q>.</p>

<h3><a id="virtualftpserverconfiguration">Virtual FTP Server
Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Bricolage pushes story documents through formatting templates to generate
output when you preview or publish them. Formatting templates can use Mason,
Template Toolkit, or HTML::Template. If you have a lot of different types of
story documents, or just elements of story documents, you'll likely end up with
a lot of templates to manage. Editing templates in the browser interface's
<code>textarea</code> fields can be a pain. A better approach is to use the
Bricolage virtual FTP server, which provides access to all Bricolage templates
via FTP. If the security of your password isn't a serious consideration
(because FTP sends passwords in the clear, and maybe you work behind a firewall
or over a virtual private network), enable the virtual FTP server and edit
Bricolage templates from within your favorite FTP-enabled editor (Emacs, Vim,
HomeSite, etc.). Here's how.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="enableftpserver"><code>ENABLE_FTP_SERVER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This boolean directive enables the virtual FTP server.  Set it to a true

href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/current/api/bric_ftpd.html" title="bric_ftpd
man page"><em>bric_ftpd</em></a> application, and get to work! Just connect to
your Bricolage FTP server on the port specified by the <code>FTP_PORT</code>
directive, login with your Bricolage username and password, and you can browse
templates by site, output channel, and category.</p>

</dd>

<dd>

<p>If your host has more than one IP address, specify one of them here to have

Bricolage root directory.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="ftpdeployonupload"><code>FTP_DEPLOY_ON_UPLOAD</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>As of Bricolage 1.8 and later, the Bricolage FTP server will save templates
to your private sandbox when you upload them. This means that they will be
checked out to you, appear in your personal workspace in the UI, and execute
when you (and only you) preview stories that use them. To check in and deploy a
template to use in production when other users preview and publish documents,
simply append the string <em>.deploy</em> to the end of the file name when you
upload it and Bricolage will do the rest.</p>

<p>Prior to version 1.8.0, the Bricolage virtual FTP server checked out,
updated, checked in, and deployed templates on every upload.  If for some
reason you prefer this approach (and to be honest, I can't imagine why
<em>anyone</em> would!), set the <code>FTP_DEPLOY_ON_UPLOAD</code> directive to
a true value and restart <em>bric_ftpd</em>.</p>

tail the FTP log (specified by the <code>FTP_LOG</code> directive) to diagnose
the problem.</p>

</dl>
<h3><a id="preloadingconfiguration">Preloading Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Because Bricolage runs on Apache 1.3, the parent process loads all of its
code at startup time, before it forks off any children. This is memory
efficient, because most modern operating systems use a copy-on-write forking
design. This means that the children all share memory with the parent until
they write to that memory, at which time the kernel copies that memory to the
child process.</p>

<p>When loading a lot of code, children never overwrite much of it.  It's
highly advantageous to load as much code as you think you'll need into the
parent process at startup time, to prevent each of the children from loading it
themselves and taking up that much more memory. These directives help you to do
just that.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="perlloader"><code>PERL_LOADER</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This string directive can be any Perl code you like, as long as it's all on
one line in the <em>bricolage.conf</em> file. Bricolage will execute this code
at startup time, in the namespace used by the Mason burner. This is very useful
for loading Perl modules that your templates use, so that you're not loading
them in each child process. The default value loads <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/mod_perl-1.29/Util/Util.pm"
title="Apache::Util on CPAN">Apache::Util</a>, which has many useful HTML
output utility functions, and <a
href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/current/api/Bric::Util::Burner"
title="Bric::Util::Burner documentation">Bric::Util::Burner</a>, which exports
several constants that you can use in templates to tell what type of burn is
being executed (preview or publish).  Other common modules you might want to
load here include <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/" title="CGI on
CPAN">CGI.pm</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-RSS/"
title="XML::RSS on CPAN">XML::RSS</a> to assist with HTML and RSS output,
respectively. You can load anything here, really.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="loadlanguages"><code>LOAD_LANGUAGES</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Bricolage has localizations for multiple languages, including German,
Portuguese, Italian, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Russian. The localization
libraries are Perl modules loaded at server startup time. For the most
efficient use of memory, load the languages you expect to use most often by
specifying the appropriate language codes (such as <q>en</q> for English,
<q>pt_pt</q> for Portuguese, <q>de_de</q> for German, etc.) in a
space-delimited list via the <code>LOAD_LANGUAGES</code> directive.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="loadcharsets"><code>LOAD_CHAR_SETS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>This directive functions just like the <code>LOAD_LANGUAGES</code>
directive, except that it loads the libraries that convert to and from UTF-8.
Bricolage allows individual users to use different character sets when
accessing the Bricolage UI, including ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, Big5, ShiftJIS,
GB-2312, and others. To save memory overhead, specify each character set that
you expect your users will need to use day-to-day in Bricolage in a
space-delimited list in the <code>LOAD_CHAR_SETS</code> directive.</p>

<h3><a id="thumbnailconfiguration">Thumbnail Configuration</a></h3>

<p>As of Bricolage 1.8.0, Bricolage can generate thumbnail versions of image
files uploaded for media documents. All you need to do is install the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Imager/" title="Imager on CPAN">Imager</a>
module from CPAN (along with the necessary libraries for the image formats you
use&#x2014;see the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/src/TONYC/Imager-0.44/README" title="Imager
README">Imager README</a> file for details) and configure thumbnail support via
these directives.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="usethumbnails"><code>USE_THUMBNAILS</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Set this Boolean directive to a true value and restart Bricolage to have
thumbnails generated for all image files in Bricolage.  You must have Imager
installed, of course. You might also want to consider installing media type
icons specific to particular types of non-image files. See the <em>README</em>
file and script in <em>contrib/copy_gnome_icons</em> in the Bricolage sources
for information on which icon files to use and how to install them using the
<em>copy_gnome_icons</em> script.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="thumbnailsize"><code>THUMBNAIL_SIZE</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Set this directive to the maximum dimension of thumbnail images, in pixels.
Bricolage will use this number to constrain the size of the thumbnail so that
its greatest dimension does not exceed this number. For example, if
<code>THUMBNAIL_SIZE</code> has its default value, <q>75</q>, and you upload a
150 x 100 pixel image file, Bricolage will generate a 75 x 50 pixel
thumbnail.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a id="htmlareaconfiguration">htmlArea Configuration</a></h3>

<p>Bricolage 1.8.0 added support for WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
editing via the <a href="http://www.htmlarea.com/" title="htmlArea
Website">htmlArea</a> JavaScript editor, though it has this feature disabled by
default. To enable it, download and install htmlArea 3.0 (in beta release as of
this writing) in the <em>comp/media/htmlarea</em> directory under your
Bricolage root.  Then configure it via these directives and restart Bricolage.
You will then be able to specify a <q>WYSIWYG</q> field type in document
element definitions, and content editors can take advantage of htmlArea's
WYSIWYG features when editing content in those fields.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="enablehtmlarea"><code>ENABLE_HTMLAREA</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>Set this Boolean directive to a true value to enable Bricolage's htmlArea
support. You must have htmlArea installed in the <em>comp/media/htmlarea</em>
directory under your Bricolage root.</p>

</dd>
<dt><a id="htmlareatoolbar"><code>HTMLAREA_TOOLBAR</code></a></dt>
<dd>

<p>The htmlArea editor offers a lot of WYSIWYG features as controls (buttons)
in its interface. The controls handle tasks such as copy, paste, italicize,
boldface, link, etc. By default, Bricolage enables only a subset of these
controls. The subset excludes layout type features such as font selection and
color, line justification, and the like. The idea is to provide only the tools
needed for users to easily add semantically meaningful markup rather than
layout markup, so as to keep content independent of presentation.  If you
really need to allow your users to use six different type faces in twelve
colors, you can enable the htmlArea controls for these features via the
<code>HTMLAREA_TOOLBAR</code> directive.  The value of the directive is a
comma-separated list of single-quoted strings with brackets at either end. See
the htmlArea documentation for a <a
href="http://www.htmlarea.com/htmlarea_2/documentation.html#setup3"
title="&#x201c;htmlArea documentation: How can I change what controls are
displayed on the toolbar?&#x201c;">complete list of supported controls</a>.</p>

<p>Now you have all the information you need to configure how Bricolage
operates to your heart's content. My next article will explore the nitty-gritty
of defining document models in Bricolage.</p>
