<p>Perl is in danger of becoming a fading language--new programmers are
learning Java and Python in college, and companies like Google hardly use Perl
at all.  If you are afraid that Perl may be in danger of becoming irrelevant
for medium-to-large projects, then read on.</p>

<h3>The Scary Part</h3>

<p>I have discussed the future of Perl with managers from companies that
currently use it and find that they worry about the future of Perl. One company
I spoke with here in San Francisco is rewriting their core application in Java.
Another company worries they will not be able to find new Perl programmers down
the road.  Yet another uses Perl for major projects, but suffers from
difficulty in refactoring their extensive code base.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why companies care about the future of Perl. I offer
a part of a solution: better tools for Perl can be a major part of keeping Perl
relevant and effective as the primary language for medium and large
projects.</p>
<!-- sidebar begins -->

<!-- sidebar ends -->
<p>When measuring the effectiveness of a development environment (people,
language, tools, processes, etc.), a key measure is how expensive and painful it
is to make changes to existing code. Once a project or system has grown to
thousands of lines of code in dozens (or hundreds) of modules, the cost of
making changes can escalate to the point where the team is afraid to make any
significant change. Excellent tools are one of the ways to avoid this unhappy
situation, or at least reduce its impact.  Other factors are excellent
processes and, of course, excellent people.</p>

<h3>21st-Century Integrated Development Environments for Perl</h3>

<p>I propose that more, high-quality development tools will help keep Perl
relevant and alive in medium and large project environments.  My focus in this
article is on IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments, and primarily those
with a graphical interface.</p>

<p>An IDE is an integrated set of tools for programming, combining a source
code editor with a variety of other tools into a single package. Common
features of modern IDEs include refactoring support, version control,
real-time syntax checking, and auto-completion of code while typing.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear right at the outset that a team of highly skilled
Perl programmers, using only tools that have been around for years (such as
<code>emacs</code>, <code>vi</code>, <code>cvs</code>, and <code>make</code>)
can and do build large, sophisticated, and successful projects.  I am not
worried about those programmers. I am worried about the larger population of
programmers with one to five years of experience, and those who have not yet begun to
program: the next generation of Perl programmers.</p>

<p>Great tools will not make a bad programmer into a good programmer, but they
will certainly make a good programmer better.  Unfortunately, the tools for
Perl are years behind what is available for other languages, particularly
Java.</p>

<p>One powerful example is the lack of graphical IDEs for Perl with excellent
support for refactoring.  Several IDEs for Java have extensive refactoring
support.  Only one for Perl, the <a href="http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/">EPIC plugin
for Eclipse</a>, supports even a single refactoring action.</p>

<p>For an example of how good IDEs have inspired at least one Perl developer,
see <a href="/pub/au/Kennedy_Adam">Adam Kennedy</a>'s <a
href="/pub/a/2005/06/09/ppi.html">Perl.com article on his
new PPI module</a> and <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Refactor/">Scott Sotka's
Devel::Refactor module</a> (used in EPIC).</p>

<p>I acknowledge that a graphical IDE is not the be-all of good tools.  Just as
some writers reject word processors in favor of typewriters or hand-written
manuscripts, some programmers reject graphical IDEs and would refuse a job that
required them to use one.  Not everyone has (nor should have) the same tool
set, and there are things a pencil can do that <code>vi</code> and
<code>emacs</code> will never do. That said, IDEs have wide use in businesses
doing larger projects, and for many programmers and teams they provide major
increases in productivity.</p>

<p>Another important point is that while this article discusses over a dozen
specific tools or features, having all the tools in a single package produces
the biggest value. An IDE that provides all of these features in a single
package that people can easily install, easily extend, and easily maintain
across an entire development team has far more value than the sum of its
parts.</p>

<p>There is a big win when the features provided by an IDE immediately upon
installation include all or almost all of the tools and features discussed here
and where the features "know" about each other. For example, it is good if you
enter the name of a non-existent subroutine and the real-time syntax checker
catches this. It is much better if the code-assist feature then pops up a
context menu offering to create a stub for the subroutine or to correct the
name to that of an existing similar subroutine or method from another class that is
available to the current file. (This is standard behavior for some Java
IDEs.)</p>

<h3>What Would a 21st-Century Perl Tool Set Contain?</h3>

<p>Perl needs a few great IDEs--not just one, but more than one so that
people have a diverse set to choose from.  Perl deserves and needs a few great
IDEs that lead the pack and set the standard for IDEs in other languages.</p>














<p>I am well aware that the dynamic nature of Perl makes it harder to have a
program that can read and understand a Perl program, especially a large and
complex one, but the difficulty in comprehending a Perl program makes the value
of such a tool all the greater, and I have faith that the Perl community can
overcome some of the built-in challenges of Perl. Indeed, it is among the
greatest strengths of Perl that Perl users can adapt the language to their
needs.</p>

<p>A great Perl IDE will contain at least the following, plus other features I
haven't thought of. (And, of course, there must be many of those!)</p>

<ul>

<li>A <a href="#Syntax-coloring_text_editor">syntax-coloring text

display syntax errors as you type.</li>

methods when you type in an object reference, for example.</li>

</ul>

<p>Most of the screen shot examples in this article use the EPIC Perl IDE.  At
present, it has the largest amount of the features on my list (although it
certainly doesn't have all of them).</p>

<h4><a id="Syntax-coloring_text_editor" />Syntax-Coloring Text Editor</h4>

<p>Most of you have probably seen this. It is available under <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>,
BBEdit, and TextPad. Just about every decent text editor will colorize source
code so that keywords, operators, variables, etc., each have their own
color, making it easier to spot syntax errors such as forgetting to close a
quote pair.</p>

<h4><a id="Syntax-checking" />Real-Time Syntax Checking</h4>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/syntax_check.gif" width="309" height="135" alt="real-time syntax check example"
/><br />
<em>Figure 1. Real-time syntax checking</em></p>

<p>The IDE in Figure 1 shows that line 4 has an error because of the missing
<code>)</code> and that line 5 has an error because there is no declaration of
<code>$naame</code> (and <code>use strict</code> is in effect).</p>

<p>A key point here is that the IDE shows these errors right away, before you
save and compile the code. (In this example, the EPIC IDE lets you specify how
often to run the syntax check, from 0.01 to 10.00 seconds of idle time, or only
on demand.)</p>

<p>As nice as this is, it would be even better if the IDE also offered ways to
fix the problem, for example, offering to change <code>$naame</code> to
<code>$name</code>. Figure 2 shows an IDE that does exactly that; unfortunately,
for Java, not Perl.</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/syntax_help.gif" width="427" height="150" alt="syntax help from the IDE" /><br
/><em>Figure 2. Syntax help from the IDE</em></p>

<p>It would be great if Perl IDEs offered this kind of help.</p>

<h4><a id="Version_control_integration" />Version Control Integration</h4>

<p>All non-insane large projects use version control software. The most common
version control software systems are probably CVS, Perforce, Subversion, and
Visual SourceSafe.  Figure 3 shows an IDE comparing the local version of a file
to an older version from the CVS repository.</p>

<table width="250" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="secondary">
<a href="/2005/08/25/graphics/cvs_compare.gif" onclick="window.open('/2005/08/25/graphics/cvs_compare.gif','fullsize','toolbar=no,width=910,height=593,status=no,location=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,menubar=yes');return false"><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/cvs_compare_sm.gif" vspace="4" alt="Figure 3" width="220" height="143" border="0" /></a><br />

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>CVS integration is available in many modern code editors, including <code>emacs</code>,
<code>vim</code>, and BBEdit, as well as graphical IDEs such as Eclipse and Komodo Pro.
Subversion integration is available as a plugin for Eclipse; Komodo Pro
supports Perforce and Subversion.</p>













<h4><a id="Code-assist" />A Code-Assist Editor</h4>

<p>Suppose that you have just typed in an object reference and want to call a
method on the object, but you are not sure what the method name is. Wouldn't it
be nice if the editor popped up a menu listing all of the methods available for
that object? It might look something like Figure 4.</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/auto_completion.gif" width="399" height="335" alt="automatic code completion" /><br
/><em>Figure 4. Automatic code completion</em></p>

<p>In this example, the IDE is able to figure out which class the object
<code>$q</code> is an instance of and lists the names of the available methods.
If you type a <code>p</code>, then the list shows only the method names
beginning with <code>p</code>. If you type <code>pa</code>, then the list shows
only the <code>param()</code> and <code>parse_params()</code> methods.</p>

<h4><a id="refactoring_support" />Excellent Refactoring Support</h4>

<p>The easier it is to do refactoring, the more often people will do it. The
following list contains the most common refactorings.  Your personal list will
probably be a little different. All of these are things you can do "manually,"
but the idea is to make them into one or two-click operations so that you will
do them much more often. (For a extensive list of refactoring operations, see
<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/">Martin Fowler's alphabetical list
of refactorings</a>.)</p>

<h5><a id="Extract_SubroutineMethod" />Extract Subroutine/Method</h5>

<p>The IDE should create a new subroutine using the selected code and replace
the selected code with a call to the new subroutine, with the proper
parameters. Here's an example of using the Extract Subroutine refactoring from
Eclipse/EPIC (which uses the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Refactor/">Devel::Refactor</a>
module).</p>

<p>First, you select a chunk of code to turn into a new subroutine, and then
select Extract Subroutine from a context menu. You then get the a dialog box
asking for the name of the new subroutine (shown in Figure 5).</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/extract_subroutine_before.gif" width="500" height="329" alt="code before Extract
Subroutine refactoring" /><br /><em>Figure 5. Code before Extract Subroutine
refactoring</em></p>

<p>The IDE replaces the selected code with a call to the new subroutine, making
reasonable guesses about the parameters and return values (Figure 6). You may
need to clean up the result manually.</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/extract_subroutine_after.gif" width="500" height="45" alt="code after Extract
Subroutine refactoring" /><br /><em>Figure 6. Code after Extract
Subroutine</em></p>

<p>Figure 7 shows the new subroutine created by the IDE.  In this case, it needs
no changes, but sometimes you will need to adjust the parameters and/or return
value(s).</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/extract_subroutine_newsub.gif" width="314" height="241" alt="the new subroutine
created by Extract Subroutine" /><br /><em>Figure 7. The new subroutine created
by Extract Subroutine</em></p>

<p>Ideally, the editor should prompt you to replace similar chunks of code with
calls to the new subroutine.</p>













<h5><a id="Rename_SubroutineMethod" />Rename Subroutine/Method</h5>

<p>The IDE should find all the calls to the subroutine throughout your project
and offer to change them for you. You should be able to see a preview of all of 
the places a change could occur, and to accept or reject each one on a case-by-case
basis. The action should be undoable.</p>

<h5><a id="Rename_Variable" />Rename Variable</h5>

<p>Like Rename Subroutine, this feature should find all occurrences throughout
the project and offer to make the changes for you.</p>

<h5><a id="Change_SubroutineMethod_signature" />Change Subroutine/Method
Signature</h5>

<p>The IDE should be able to make reasonable guesses about whether each
subroutine or method call is supplying the proper parameters. Partly this is to
enable the <a href="?page=2#Syntax-checking">real-time syntax checking mentioned
above</a>,  and partly this is to enable you to select a subroutine declaration
and tell the IDE you want to refactor it by adding or removing a parameter. The
IDE should then prompt you for the change(s) you want to make, do its best
to find all of the existing calls to the subroutine, and offer to correct the
subroutine calls to supply the new parameters.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is an especially tricky thing to do in Perl, where
subroutines fish their parameters out of <code>@_</code>. So the IDE would have
to look carefully at how the code uses <code>shift</code>, <code>@_</code>, and
<code>$_[]</code> in order to have a reasonable guess about the parameters the
subroutine is expecting. In many common cases, though, a Perl IDE could make a
reasonable guess about the parameters, such as in the following two examples,
so that if you added or removed one, it could immediately prompt you about
making corrections throughout the project:</p>

<pre><code>sub doSomething {
    my $gender = shift;
    my $age    = shift;
    # Not too terribly hard to guess that $gender and $age are params
}

sub anotherThing {
    my ($speed,$direction) = @_;
    # No magic needed to guess $speed and $direction are params.
}</code></pre>

<h5><a id="Move_SubroutineMethod_to_different" />Move Subroutine/Method</h5>

<p>This refactoring operation should give you a list or dialog box to choose
the destination file in your project. The IDE should allow you to preview all
of the changes that it would make to accomplish the move, which will include
updating a call to the subroutine/method to use the proper class. At a minimum,
the IDE should show you or list all of the calls to the subroutine so you can make
the appropriate changes yourself. Ideally, the IDE should make a guess about
possible destinations; for example, if <code>$self</code> is a parameter to the
method being moved, then the IDE might try assuming the method is an object
(instance) method and initially only list destination classes that inherit from
the source class, or from which the source class inherits.</p>

<h5><a id="Change_package_name" />Change a Package Name</h5>

<p>As with Rename Subroutine and Rename Variable, when changing a package name,
the IDE should offer to update all existing references throughout your
project.</p>

<h4><a id="Tree_view_of_source" />Tree View and Navigation of Source Files
and Resources</h4>

<p>Another useful feature of good IDEs is being able to view all of the code
for a project, or multiple projects, in a tree format, where you can "fold" and
"unfold" the contents of folders. All of the modern graphical IDEs support this,
even with multiple projects in different languages.</p>

<p>Being able to view your project in this manner gives you both a high-level
overview and the ability to drill down into specific files, and to mix levels
of detail by having some folders show their contents and some not.</p>

<p>For example, Figure 8 shows a partial screen shot from ActiveState's Komodo
IDE.</p>

<p><img src="/pub/2005/08/25/graphics/komodo_code_tree.gif" width="204" height="318" alt="tree view of code in Komodo"
/><br /><em>Figure 8. Tree view of code in Komodo</em></p>

<h4><a id="support_for_unit_tests" />Support for Creating and Running Unit
Tests</h4>

<p>Anyone who has installed Perl modules from CPAN has seen unit tests--these
are the various, often copious, tests that run when you execute the <code>make
test</code> part of the installation process. The vast majority of CPAN modules
include a suite of tests, often using the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness">Test::Harness</a> and/or <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple">Test::More</a> modules. A good
IDE will make it very easy to both create and run unit tests as you develop
your project.</p>













<p>The most basic form of support for unit tests in an IDE is simply to make it
easy to execute arbitrary scripts from within the IDE.  Create a
<em>test.pl</em> for your project and keep adding tests to it or to a
<em>t/</em> subdirectory as you develop, and keep running the script as you
make changes. All modern IDEs provide at least this minimal capability.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated level of support for unit tests might resemble the Java
IDE feature for tests written in JUnit, where you can select an existing class
file (a <em>.pm</em> file in Perl) and ask the IDE to create a set of stub
tests for every subroutine in the file. (See <a
href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> and the Perl module <code><a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Unit/">Test::Unit</a></code> for more on
unit tests.) Furthermore, the IDE should support running a set of tests and
giving simple visual feedback on what passed/failed. The standard approach in
the JUnit world is to show either a "green bar" (all passed) or "red bar"
(something failed) and then allow you to see details on failures. Other
nice-to-have features include calculating code-coverage, providing statistical
summaries of tests, etc.</p>

<p>Figure 9 shows a successful run of a Java test suite with Eclipse.</p>

<p>A stack trace of the failure message appears in another part of the window
(cropped out here to save space).  If you double-click on the test that failed
(<code>testInflate</code>), the IDE will open the file
(<code>BalloonTest</code>, in this case) and navigate to the test function.</p>

<p>The central idea is that the IDE should make it as painless as possible to
add and modify and run tests, so you will do more of it during development.</p>

<h4><a id="Language-specific_help" />Language-Specific Help</h4>

<p>This is a fairly straightforward idea--the IDE should be able to find and
display the appropriate documentation for any keyword in your code, so if you
highlight <code>push</code> and ask for help, you should see the
<code>push</code> entry from the Perl documentation. If you highlight a method
or subroutine or other symbol name from an imported module, the IDE should
display the module's documentation for the selected item. Of course, this
requires that the documentation be available in a consistent, machine-readable
form, which is only sometimes true.</p>

<h4><a id="Debugger" />Debugger with Real-Time Display of Results</h4>

<p>All modern IDEs offer support for running your code under a debugger,
usually with visual display of what's going on, including the state of
variables. The <a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/Komodo/3.1/komodo-doc-debugperl.html#debugperl_top">Komodo
IDE supports debugging Perl that is running either locally or remotely</a>.</p>

<p>Typical support for debugging in an IDE includes the ability to set
breakpoints, monitor the state of variables, etc.  Basically, the IDE should
provide support for all of the features of the debugger itself.  Graphical IDEs
should provide a visual display of what is going on.</p>

<h4><a id="Automatic_reformatting" />Automatic Code Reformatting</h4>

<p>This means automatically or on-demand re-indenting and other reformatting of
code. For example, when you cut and paste a chunk of code, the IDE should
support reformatting the chunk to match the indentation of its new location. If you change the number of spaces or tabs for each level of indentation, or
your convention for the placement of curly braces, then the IDE should support
adjusting an entire file or all files in your project.</p>

<h4><a id="handling_of_multiple_languages" />Seamless Handling of Multiple
Languages</h4>

<p>Many large software projects involve multiple languages. This is almost
universally true in the case of web applications, where the user interface
typically uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the back end uses one or more of
Perl, PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. It is very helpful to have development
tools that seamlessly integrate work done in all of the languages.  This is
becoming quite common. For example, both Komodo and Eclipse support multiple
languages.</p>

<h4><a id="Automated_build_and_test" />Automated Building and Testing</h4>

<p>This feature can be very basic by making it easy to run an arbitrary script
from within the IDE and to see its output. This could be as simple as having
the IDE configured to have a one-click way of running the traditional Perl
module build-and-test commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test</code></pre>

<p>A more advanced version of this feature might involve having the IDE create
stub code to test all of the subroutines in an existing file, or to run all of the
scripts in a specified directory under <code>Test::Harness</code>, or to run a
set of tests using <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Test::Unit::TestRunner">Test::Unit::TestRunner</a>
or <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Test::Unit::TkTestRunner">Test::Unit::TkTestRunner</a>.
(The latter provides a GUI testing framework.)</p>













<h3>Conclusion and Recommendations</h3>

<p>While there are many tools for helping Perl development, the current state
of the Perl toolbox is still years behind those of other languages--perhaps three to five years
behind, when compared to Java tools. While there are several tools for Java that
have all the features described above, virtually none for Perl have all of them.
On the other hand, things are looking up; they are better now than a year ago.
It's possible to close that gap in a year or two.</p>

<p>A couple of obvious areas where improvements could be somewhat easy are
adding more features to EPIC and Komodo.  EPIC is open source, so there is
potentially a wider pool of talent that could contribute. On the other hand,
Komodo has a company with money behind it, so people actually get paid to
improve it. Hopefully both tools will get better with time.</p>

<p>Another interesting possibility is the development of new IDEs or adding to
existing ones by using <a
href="/pub/a/2005/06/09/ppi.html">Adam Kennedy's PPI
module</a>, which provides the ability to parse Perl documents into a
reasonable abstract syntax tree and to manipulate the elements and re-compose
the document. There is a <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Editor-Vip/">new Perl editor project,
VIP, that is in the design stages</a> and is intended to be "pluggable" and to have
special features to support pair programming.</p>

<p>Finally, I've gathered a couple of lists of links for related material. The
first list below consist of IDEs and graphical editors for Perl, and the second
list consists of various related articles and websites. I hope this is all
inspirational and helpful.</p>

<h3>Current IDEs for Perl</h3>

<p>The listed IDEs support Perl. The list is undoubtedly
incomplete, but should form a good starting point for anyone wishing
to look into this further.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/affrus/">Affrus</a></p>

<p>Perl only, Mac OS X only. Closed source (and hence not extensible by
users). Primarily designed for CGI and standalone scripts. Free demo
available. $99 to purchase.  (See the <a
href="/pub/a/2004/05/14/affrus.html">Perl.com review of
Affrus</a> to learn more.)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/">Eclipse/EPIC</a></p>

<p>EPIC is a plugin for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse
platform</a>. Eclipse is open-source and cross platform
(Windows/Mac/Linux/Solaris, etc.). Once you have Eclipse installed, <a
href="http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/updates">install the EPIC plugin from within the
Eclipse application</a> using the <a href="http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/updates/">EPIC
update URL</a>.  Eclipse supports Java, and with plugins, C/C++, COBOL, Perl,
PHP, UML2, Python, Ruby, XML, and more. There is a large and active community
around Eclipse.</p></li>

<li>Emacs is the mother of all
text-editor/development-environment/adventure-game/all-in-one tools. Expert
programmers use it widely and there are numerous enhancements for working with
particular languages, including, of course, Perl. <a
href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CPerlMode">Emacs, with
CPerlMode</a>,  is a richly featured IDE for Perl, albeit a non-GUI IDE (which,
for some people, makes it even better). <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeperl/files/">A set of extensions for
CPerlMode are available</a> but you need to join the Yahoo Extreme Perl group
to get to them.</li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo</a></p>

<p>This runs on Linux, Solaris, and Windows. Free demo; $29.95 for personal and
student use, $295 for commercial use.  It supports Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, and
XSLT.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.elora.hostings.com/SOFTWARE/page/">PAGE</a></p>

<p>PAGE runs only on Windows (9x/ME/NT/2000/XP). It is a Rapid
Application Development tool for Perl and comes in three versions: Free,
Standard ($10), and Enterprise ($50). PAGE provides a several "wizards" for
creating scripts, modules (packages), web forms, and even database
applications.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.enginsite.com/Perl.htm">Perl Editor</a></p>

<p>This closed source program runs only on Windows (9x/NT/2000/XP). It has a GUI
code profiler, and the Pro version has a regular expression tester and built-in
web server (for CGI testing, etc.). Perl Editor claims to have the best
debugger on the market. It also comes with GUI tools for managing MySQL
databases. $69.95 to purchase.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/"><code>vim</code></a></p>

<p>The well-known descendent of <code>vi</code> is a powerful and flexible text
editor with many plugins and extensions. Have a look at the
<a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/"><code>vim</code> scripts </a>; for
example, <a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=556">vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=556</a>
and <a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=281">vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=281</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.helpconsulting.net/visiperl/">visiPerl</a></p>

<p>This is a closed source application that runs on Win9x/NT/2000.  It handles
Perl and HTML and has code templates, being designed for website building.
visiPerl includes a built-in web server for testing and an FTP client for code
deployment.  There is a free demo, or you can purchase it for $59.</p></li>
