<p>Surprise! It's me again. You may be wondering what happened to last week's
summary (I know I was) and where Matt had gone. Well, I'm not entirely sure
where exactly he is now, but last week was moving week for him.</p>

<p>Those of you reading this on the mailing lists may also be wondering why
this summary is so late. Um ... three words: <i>World of Warcraft</i>.</p>

<h3>This Week in <i>perl6-compiler</i></h3>

<p>As a summarizer, when you see the &quot;last fortnight&quot; view of a mailing list
containing 21 messages, several thoughts spring, unbidden, to your mind: "Is my
mail broken again?" "Has everyone given up?" "Phew, this group won't take long to
do."</p>

<p>It turns out that the answer to both of those questions is &quot;No.&quot; What
actually happened was that most of the stuff that normally happens in mail
happened at the Austrian Perl Workshop and Leo T&ouml;tsch's house, with a side
order of IRC conversation and a bunch of spinoff threads in <i>p6l</i> and <i>p6i</i>.</p>

<p>In the last fortnight, <a href="http://use.perl.org/~autrijus/journal/"> Pugs
reached the point where it has a (mostly) working Parrot back end, and </a>
B&Aacute;RTHAZI Andras wondered if we shouldn't <a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622861">start
a <i>perl6-general</i> mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3>This Week in <i>perl6-internals</i></h3>

<p>140 messages in this one. <i>p6c</i> lulled me into a false sense of security.
Again, you may notice a bewilderingly fast rate of change this summary. It
turns out that they weren't just working on Pugs at Leo's house. Perl 6
Hackathons give great productivity.</p>

<h4>This Is Not Your Father's Parrot</h4>

<p>There's been some serious work going on under the Parrot hood in the last
two weeks. Leo and Chip have drastically reworked the calling conventions, which
now use four new opcodes: <code>set_args</code>, <code>set_returns</code>,
<code>get_params</code>, and <code>get_results</code>.  At the time of writing,
IMCC doesn't give you full syntactic help with them, but they're easy enough to
use explicitly for the time being and the help is getting there. Check out the
<a
href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/docs/pdds/pdd03_calling_conventions.pod">Parrot
Calling Conventions PDD</a> for details.</p>

<p>Also getting rejigged is the continuation/register frame architecture.
Taking advantage of the fact that this is a <em>virtual</em> machine, we now
have an unlimited number of registers per register frame. Combine this with the
new calling conventions, in which arguments are passed outside of the register
frame, and all of a sudden a full continuation becomes a simple pointer to the
register frame and everything gets saved as if by magic, which opens up a whole
bunch of possibilities, which has interesting implications for the register
allocator.</p>

<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/~chip/journal/">Chip's design notes</a></p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=41b037ed050608072845298c13@mail.gmail.com">New
Generational GC Scheme</a></h4>

<p>Alexandre Buisse posted his outline for a Google Summer of Code project to
implement a shiny new Generational Garbage Collection scheme. Discussion of
tunability and threading issues followed.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=493A37523A8D17448240DA1DDDE924B4044D9040@MSGBOSCLD2WIN.DMN1.FMR.COM">Ordered
Hashes: More Thoughts</a></h4>

<p>Steve Tolkin helpfully provided a summary of his thoughts about ordered
hashes: &quot;An ordered hash that does not support deletes could cause a user-visible bug. At a minimum, it should support the special case of delete that is
supported by the Perl <code>each()</code> operator.&quot; Dan pointed out that
reusing the ordered hash code for anything other than the lexical pad it was
specifically implemented for was just looking for trouble.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050612111515.GA19372@tytlal.topaz.cx">The
Thread That I Really Hoped Matt Would Be Summarizing</a></h4>

<p>AKA &quot;Attack of the 50-foot register allocator vs. the undead continuation
monster.&quot; Piers Cawley and Chip had something of a disagreement about
interactions between continuations and the register allocator. After discussion
on IRC, it became apparent that they were talking past each other. The new &quot;the
register frame is the continuation&quot; means that yes, the register allocator
definitely can't rely on being able to reuse registers that persist over
function calls, but that's all right because you can always grab more
registers.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050612113805.GC19372@tytlal.topaz.cx">Missing
MMD Default Functions</a></h4>

<p>Remember the missing multimethod functions I mentioned last time? At the
time, Chip hadn't ruled on whether taking them out was the Right Thing or not.
He has since ruled that it was.</p>

<p>This is probably not quite the right place to suggest this, but what the
heck. Maybe in future when planning user visible changes of this sort, they
should spend at least one release period deprecated and throwing warnings when
used.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=42AA039B.8030000@coleda.com">PGE,
Namespaced Rules</a></h4>

<p>William Coleda worried that PGE subrules appear to be globally scoped.  It
turns out that Patrick worries, too, but is currently in the process of
thrashing out how to scope them. He outlined his current thinking.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=42AA13D4.1010201@home.nl">PMCs
and Objects Question</a></h4>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol wondered about the possibilities of overriding PMC behavior
with Parrot classes. He outlined possibilities and wondered if he was correct.
Chip thought that it should be possible to implement (for instance) Perl's
datatypes in pure PIR, if only for debugging and fun. I'm still not entirely
sure if it's possible to make a <code>ParrotClass</code> that inherits from a
PMC, though.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-3.0.11-36250-115576.12.1956142453591@perl.org">Software
Transactional Memory</a></h4>

<p>It seems the design team have drunk deeply of the Software Transaction
Memory (STM) Kool Aid. STM is, to quote Chip, a &quot;wicked cool&quot; way of doing
threading. Expect a more-fleshed-out design document eventually.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=1579101353.20050611234913@rblasch.org">Parrot
<code>bc</code></a></h4>

<p>According to the configuration scripts, Parrot looks for the GNU version of
<code>bc</code> solely for checking that Parrot <code>bc</code> is working.
This is all very well, but there is no Parrot implementation of <code>bc</code>
in the SVN repository. Apparently, there's a broken version of it sitting on
Bernhard Schmalhofer's local hard disk.</p>

<p>None of which addressed the issue of why, even with a &quot;working&quot; version, the
tests need to access GNU <code>bc</code>. Surely it's possible to write tests
statically. The only time you'd need an authoritative version would be when you
were adding tests. Oops, editorializing again.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=42ABB476.3030109@coleda.com">Substituting
for PGE</a></h4>

<p>Will Coleda wondered if it was possible to do substitutions with PGE yet.
&quot;Yes, sort of,&quot; Patrick replied.  You can substitute the first occurrence by
grabbing the match data and using <code>substr</code>. Everything else is for
another day.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=42AC11C4.9000501@home.nl">Unexpected
Behavior Calling Method</a></h4>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol had some problems implementing delegated addition.
Apparently it's because the signatures of the <code>__add</code> methods caught
him out. Also, it's a really bad idea to delegate to a method called
<code>__add</code>, because Parrot expects some very particular behavior from
it. Think about calling it <code>add</code> instead.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050612103228.GI4954@tytlal.topaz.cx">Parrot
Goals and Priorities</a></h4>

<p>Chip's put the slides of his Austrian Perl Workshop talk on <a
href="http://feather.perl6.nl/~chip/Chip_APW.pdf">the Parrot project and its
priorities</a> up on feather. Check them out; they're good.</p>

TODOs</a></h4>

<p>Will Coleda's been busy injecting a bunch of handy TODO items in the Parrot
RT system. Check 'em out, you might be able to do some of them.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=Pine.LNX.4.62.0506122306160.11002@hydrogen.sabren.com">New
List for Pirate</a></h4>

<p>Michal Wallace announced the creation of <a
href="http://cornerhost.com/mailman/listinfo/pirate">a new list for work on
Pirate</a>, a Python compiler for Parrot. If Python on Parrot is your bag, I
suggest you sign up.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050615203833.GC7329@pmichaud.com">Adding
Methods to Existing Classes</a></h4>

<p>Patrick wondered how to add methods to existing classes. It turns out that
the trick is to use <code>find_type</code> instead of <code>findclass</code>.
According to Leo, <code>findclass</code> is deprecated.</p>

<h3>Meanwhile, in <i>perl6-language</i></h3>

<p>Hmm. 1242 GMT+1 on Thursday as I write this, and there are, oh, 246
messages in <i>perl6-language</i>. This could get sketchy.</p>

<h4>Reduce Metaoperator on an Empty List</h4>

<p>Wow! The &quot;Reduce metaoperator on an empty list&quot; discussion is still
going.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2617767"><code>return()</code>
in Pointy Type Blocks</a></h4>

<p>Much to my personal chagrin, it looks like <code>return()</code> inside a
of pointy block will use an escape continuation and will probably be picky about
making sure that you can only invoke the pointy block from somewhere
dynamically &quot;below&quot; the block in which it was created. This means no cunning tricks
like:</p>

<pre><code>sub call_with_current_continuation(Code $code) {
  $code({ return $^cc })
}</code></pre>

<p>which is probably a good thing.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2619348"><code>caller</code>
and <code>want</code></a></h4>

<p>Gaal Yahas asked for clarification about the behavior of the
<code>caller</code> builtin. Larry provided it.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2619327">Musing
on Registerable Event Handlers for Some Specific Events</a></h4>

<p>Adam Kennedy hoped that Perl 6 would have some sort of minimal set of hooks
for handling events. (Personally, I'd like a maximal set of hooks for anything
that changes the runtime structure of Perl, but I'm greedy like that.) Larry
said that there would be such a thing, but that it wasn't designed yet. He
appeared to volunteer Adam as an initial designer.  Discussion ensued, but
there's no concrete design yet. Slightly tangentially, Dan discussed his <a
href="http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000414.html">thoughts about a
Parrot notifications manager</a> on his blog, which might be useful to
some.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2621258">Speed Bump
Placement</a></h4>

<p>In a thread discussing adding an <code>eval STRING</code>-type behavior to
the right-hand side of a substitution, Larry said that &quot;Deciding where (and
where not) to put the speed bumps is a pretty good description of my job. It's
impossible to have a language without bumps, so I reserve the right to put the
necessary bumps where I think they'll do the most good and/or least harm.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, I thought that was worth reading by more than just the list
subscribers.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622814">MMD
Vs. Anonymous Parameter Types Referencing Early Parameters</a></h4>

<p>Chip threw up his hands and despaired of ever efficiently implementing:</p>

<pre><code>  multi sub is_equal(Integer $a, Integer where { $_ == $a } $b: ) { 1 }</code></pre>

<p>Which is cute, but Chip claims you need Jedi mind powers if you want to make
it work.</p>

<p>Then Thomas Sandla&szlig; popped up to say that actually, there was already a
language called Cecil that allowed you to do precisely that sort of thing
(called Predicate Dispatch) and there were several efficient implementation
strategies. After a nudge from Chip, he even provided a link. Larry thought it
eminently doable, too, and sketched out a strategy.</p>

<p>That strategy (which applies almost everywhere in Perl, when you think about)
boils down to &quot;If you can't do it at compile time, do it at runtime (and
pretend you did it at runtime).&quot;</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2620863">State
of the Design Documents</a></h4>

<p>Joshua Gatcomb worries about the state of the synopses. He argued (quite
persuasively) that the thing to do would be to put the synopses into public
change control with global read access, but with write access limited to
@Larry. The community could then provide new documentation in the form of
patches, which @Larry would approve, reject, or modify as appropriate, which all
hangs on whether @Larry has sufficient tuits.</p>

<p>Patrick pointed out that this already exists and that he had volunteered as
gatekeeper and patch dispatcher, but that there were very few patches so far.
But now you all know about it, right?</p>

<p>Some discussion followed about how to flesh out things, but the important
thing is the <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk">Perl 6 design
document repository</a> URL.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2621742">How
Much Do We Close Over?</a></h4>

<p>Piers Cawley wants to be able to write code like:</p>

<pre><code>sub foo { my $x = 1; return sub { eval $^codestring } }
say foo().('$x'); # 1</code></pre>

<p>In Perl 5, this gives warnings about an undeclared variable. Chip maintained
that this is actually the Right Thing. Piers understood that it may not be the
right thing in all cases, but he wanted to be able to make it work when needed,
if necessarily, with predeclaration. There was some discussion, but nothing from
@Larry yet.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622126"><code>BEGIN
{...}</code> and IO</a></h4>

<p>Ingo Blechschmidt noted that that <code>BEGIN {...}</code> can be a little
scary when you want to compile to bytecode. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>my $fh = BEGIN { open &quot;some_file&quot; err ... }</code></pre>

<p>This is okay, until you have a version of Perl that compiles that to
bytecode. The response ran along the lines of &quot;Don't do that, then!&quot;</p>

<p>Personally I'd write that as:</p>

<pre><code>my $fh = INIT { open &quot;some_file&quot; err ... }</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that my recollection that <code>INIT</code> blocks happen after the
code is compiled but before it starts to run--or do I mean a
<code>CHECK</code> block?</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622133">Anonymous
Macros</a></h4>

<p>Ingo also wondered if anonymous macros (at compile time) were allowed.
Larry had no problem with macros being first-class objects during the compile.
He also went on to wonder if they should be multidispatch, too.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622337">Perl Defined <code>Object</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code> Classes</a></h4>

<p>While toying with Pugs, Eric Hodges managed to overwrite the internal
definition of the <code>Object</code> class, which obviously caused him pain. Larry reckons
we'll have constructs like:</p>

<pre><code>class Object is augmented { ... };
class Object is replaced { ... };</code></pre>

<p>(names up for grabs). My personal preference is for making
<code>augmented</code> the default behavior, but I'll live if I can have a
pragma that makes it that way.</p>

<h4><code>%hash1 &raquo;...&laquo; %hash2</code></h4>

<p>David Formosa wondered about the behavior of hyperops when applied to a
pair of hashes. He wanted things arranged so that if you had a hash with keys
in common, then the hypering process would keep them together.  Luke agreed that
it would be useful (so do I, for that matter) and then everyone started talking
about inner and outer joins and my database comprehension head swapped out for
the moment.</p>

<h4>Binding Slices</h4>

<p>With a small correction for syntactical niceness, Piers wondered if:</p>

<pre><code>my @y := @foo[0...][1]</code></pre>

<p>would bind <code>@y</code> to a column of the two-dimensional matrix
represented by <code>@foo[][]</code>, so that writing to <code>@y</code> would
affect <code>@foo</code> and vice versa. @Larry hasn't said anything yet.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622775"><code>alias</code>
the RubyMeter</a></h4>

<p>B&Aacute;RTHAZI Andras wondered if Perl 6 would have something like Ruby's
rather lovely <code>alias</code>. Larry thought you should be able to write a
macro to do the job, but wasn't entirely sure how exactly it would be done.
Further discussion centered on whether the feature was a good idea and whether
it had the right name. One school of thought thinks it already exists as
<code>:=</code>, but I'm not quite so sure.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622877"><code>&amp;?CALLER::BLOCK</code>
Vs. Any Hope of Efficiency</a></h4>

<p>Chip hopes that using <code>&amp;?CALLER::BLOCK</code> as a general-purpose
block promoter will be disallowed unless the calling block has already marked
itself as callable. Larry thought that this would be okay, noting that he saw
<code>&amp;?CALLER::BLOCK</code> being mostly used for introspective
purposes.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2622993">Creating
a Web Templating Engine</a></h4>

<p>Wow! Perl 6 isn't even finished, and already Andras is talking about writing
a web templating engine for it. He outlined his plan and wondered how to go
about implementing it. He and Ingo discussed it.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2630895">Hyper
Concat</a></h4>

<p>Thomas Klausner has been playing with <code>&raquo;~&laquo;</code> and
uncovered some weirdness. Said weirdness lead to a discussion of <a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2658196">the
default strings/patterns in <code>split</code> and <code>join</code></a>.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2710261"><code>sub
my_zip (...?) {}</code></a></h4>

<p>Autrijus worried that the current Pugs implementation of <code>zip</code>
was signatureless, which, among other things, makes it uncompilable to Parrot.
He wondered what its function signature should be.  Larry came up with the
(admittedly slightly weird) goods.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2710606">Ignoring
Parameters</a></h4>

<p>Gaal Yahas wondered if he'd be able to write a class method as:</p>

<pre><code>method greet(Class undef:) {...}</code></pre>

<p>when his class methods made no references to the class object itself.
Damian thought that the syntax should actually be:</p>

<pre><code>method greet(FooClass ::class) {...}</code></pre>

<p>and that subs and methods should complain about unused non-optional
non-invocant parameters. There's more; see the sub for details.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2710912">Scalar
Dereferencing</a></h4>

<p>Autrijus wondered about the semantics of a scalar reference in the face of
stringification and numification. He provided an example of Pugs' current
behavior that may or may not be correct. Larry described broken behavior
before thinking again and describing the really correct behavior, along with a
summary of his raccoon problems.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2711310">Taking
<code>given</code> as Read</a></h4>

<p>Piers wondered how to write a function that would look like a
<code>given</code> block to any <code>when</code>s inside of it. It turns out that
you can't, yet. Damian thought that the right way to do it would be:</p>

<pre><code>sub factorial (Int $n is topic) {
  return 1 when 0;
  $n * factorial($n - 1);
}</code></pre>

<p>Reading this again, I find myself wondering if the <code>return</code> is
really necessary.</p>

<h4>
<code>./method</code>
</h4>

<p>People don't like <code>./method</code>. Other people don't like
<code>.method</code> in methods. I think we have what we have on the &quot;least
worst option&quot; principle--but I would say that I don't like
<code>./method</code>.</p>

<h4><a
href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl6-language/2713984"><code>AUTOLOAD</code>
and <code>$_</code></a></h4>

<p>Sam Vilain wondered about the prototype of <code>AUTOLOAD</code>. In the
discussion that ensued, some people felt that whatever happened,
<code>AUTOLOAD</code> should return a code ref that <em>perl</em> would
call.</p>

<h3>Th-Th-The-That's All, Folks!</h3>

<p>I remember now why I gave up writing summaries in the first place. First, I
started missing weeks, which meant that there was so much to write up in the
fortnightly summaries, and then discussions grew interesting, which meant
writing them took so much longer because there were hard things to understand
first.</p>

<p>Still, once in a while is refreshing, but I really should stop putting
things off until the last minute.</p>

<p>Ahem.</p>
