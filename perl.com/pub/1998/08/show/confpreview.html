<!-- Perl Conference 2.0 Off and Running -->

<P><p>Perl developers are beginning to
gather in San Jose for O'Reilly's
second Perl Conference, which opens
with tutorials on Monday.  This year pre-registration
is up and the program is expanded 
considerably from last year.
<P>
For 1998,
there is a vendor showcase, featuring products
by and for Perl developers. Among the vendors
who will be exhibiting are ActiveState, Binary
Evolution, Modcomp, Red Hat, Shpink Software and
Solutionsoft.
Of course, O'Reilly will feature new Perl titles, such as <I>The
Perl Cookbook</i> by Tom Christiansen and
Nathan Torkington.
<P>
Once again the highlight of the Conference
will be <b>Larry Wall's keynote</b> on Wednesday.  Perhaps
the best moment of the first Perl Conference
was quite simply the opportunity for attendees
to give Larry Wall a standing ovation when he
was introduced by Tim O'Reilly.  Be prepared
for the <i>Second State of the Onion</i> speech, complete
with cheap sound effects.
<P>
<b>Netscape's Tom Paquin</b> will be Thursday's keynote.  Paquin
heads up the Mozilla project, and he is expected to
provide an update on what has happened since Netscape made
browser's source code freely available. Open Source
will no doubt a hot topic this year, and Friday's Open Source Developer's Day is now included as a bonus
for Perl Conference attendees.
<P>
Other additions to this year's Perl Conference
include the "The Guru is In" sessions, which
make Perl experts available for casual Q&A exchanges.
Also, because last year's <b>Apache and ModPerl</b> talks
were so popular, there's a full Apache and Perl
track.
<P>
Of course, there is light fare at this year's Conference, including the <b>Perl Film Festival</b> (we don't even want
to guess what movies will be shown).
<P>

for more reports, photos, and announcements from
Perl Conference 2.0.
