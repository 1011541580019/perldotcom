<!-- Lincoln's Cool Tricks and Regex -->
<h3>Monday's Highlights</h3>

<!::field::id-author::><BR><P><P>The first day of The Perl Conference is behind us and the knowledge sharing
is in high gear.
<P>
Today I attended two excellent tutorials.  The first was called <I>Cool
Tricks with Perl and Apache</I> by Lincoln Stein and the second was
<I>Understanding Perl Regular Expressions</I> by Jeffrey Friedl.
<H4>Cool Tricks with Perl and Apache</H4>
<I>Cool Tricks with Perl and Apache</I> was the ideal seminar for anyone
running a web server.  Yes, the seminar was geared toward the <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org">Apache</A> web server but the concepts and  most of
the code that Lincoln provided is useful for any webmaster/developer.
<P>
Lincoln talked extensively about how to manage and process log files.  This
may seem like a trivial task on the surface, but managing an ever-growing
file is not as easy as working with just any file.  Lincoln provided useful
tips and code to help.
<P>
My favorite example that Lincoln talked about was how to set up an Apache
web server to log to a mySQL database instead of the standard text files.
By doing this, you are able to perform ad-hoc queries on the data on
anything we choose.  Since the log files are in a SQL database, to get at
the data you simply use SQL to select and manipulate the data that you are
looking for.
<P>
A very humorous moment, although unintended, according to Lincoln, occurred
when he was talking about using Perl to monitor a remote server.  The
script he was demonstrating connected to a site and used the LWP libraries
<I>head</I> command.  The site Lincoln referred to was the White House.
Since the latest White House scandal is still on everyone's mind, this
struck the crowd as very funny and several other funny comments followed
(none of which I wish to discuss here).  <I>See the kind of fun you miss if
you don't come to the conference?</I>
<H4>Understanding Regular Expressions</H4>
The <I>Understanding Perl Regular Expressions</I> was an excellent seminar
by Jeffrey Friedl.  Jeffrey did a wonderful job of explaining some of the
details of how Perl handles regular expressions.

<P>
Trying to explain regular expressions in a three-hour seminar is no easy
task.  Heck, trying to explain regular expressions in a fifty-hour seminar
would be hard!
<P>
Having been out of Jeffrey's seminar for several hours now, still my head
is spinning.  If you think you have regular expressions under control, and
can write them with your hands tied behind your back... think again!
Jeffery show several examples of simple regular expressions that looked
harmful enough, but didn't work anything like you would expect!
<P>
One quick example:  If you pass the string <B>ab ab ab ab</B> into this
regular expression: <CODE>/a*((ab)*|b*)/</CODE> what would you expect it
to match?  Well, the <CODE>b*</CODE> will <B>never ever</B> be evaluated
because the asterisks inside the parenthesis make it <I>always</I> match.
Also, since the <B>a</B> matches and then we hit an asterisk, this regular
expression really only matches the <B>a</B> and then exits!  Remember, the
asterisk means <I>match zero or more times.</I>
<P>
Jeffrey had many more examples that looked innocent enough, but were
basically regular expression death-traps.  The examples provided in the
seminar are too detailed to explain here, but if/when I get the links to
the seminar notes, I will post the URL where you can find them.
<H4>Suds</H4>
After today's conference, it was <I>buy-Randal-beer night.</I>  How do
these guys get such great nights named after them?  Anyway, several of us
had an enjoyable evening at the Tied House Brewery and Cafe talking about
Perl and visiting with Randal.  <I>When is buy-Brent-beer night?</I> ;-)
<P>
Tuesday promises to be an exciting day also.  I will be at the <I>Advanved
Perl Fundamentals</I> seminar by Randal Schwartz.  It is an all-day seminar
that promises to be an awesome learning experience!  I will let you know
about it tomorrow.
<P>
It is not too late to get here and get a lot out of the conference!  Larry
Wall gives his "State of the Onion" address Wednesday morning.
