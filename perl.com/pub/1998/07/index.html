            <!-- How Perl Creates Orders for the Air Force -->


<BR>
<P><I>This article is the first in a series that will provide examples of Perl solving real-world problems, particularly
in an organization.  If you have
your own real-life story to tell, 
send it to <A Href="mailto:dale@songline.com">Perl.com Editor</A>.
</I>
<P>
<font size=+2>How many times</font> have I been 
in a meeting where someone questions
using Perl for a key business application?  
Someone says we shouldn't use Perl because it is 
<I>freeware</I>. 
Most programming languages, I argue, are not <I>owned</I> by
anyone.  Are C and C++ any different from Perl in that regard? 
If I win that point, someone brings up yet another.
I once had a webmaster tell me
that we shouldn't use Perl because of virus concerns.</P>

<P>I just have to accept the fact that educating everyone
about Perl is part of the price I pay to use Perl.  
Fortunately, most people are easily persuaded and
when I start talking about Perl, it is hard to shut me up.
</P>

<P><font size=+2>While I was in the Air Force</font>, I worked in the Base Network Control
Center.  It was our responsibility to handle all computer hardware
and software purchases for the base.</P>

<P>The process of ordering equipment was not simple. 
Many forms had to be filled out and then signed by the right
people in all of the right places.  </P>

<P>We had created a database to track all of this for us but it was
still a difficult process.  A single order might have to be on 10
different forms and have 2 or 3 different documents generated.  Also,
there were 13 different times that 
the database entries had to be updated, from the
start of an order until the equipment was received and picked up. 
This left too much room for human error.  
Updating the database was a bother and many times it just didn't
get done.  Because of this, the integrity of the database was always in
question.  Even <I>if</I> the database was religiously maintained, 
the ordering process itself was cumbersome. 
With nearly 1,000 orders per year, this was a lot of work! </P>

<P>Since I was doing
Web development for the base, I proposed a web-based solution written
in Perl.   In a meeting to discuss the project, I 
was candid.  I said I wasn't sure I could do it but I'd
give it a try. There were other solutions proposed but my
Web-based solution won out. </P>

<P>We had a list of requirements for the application:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Web-based database</LI>
<LI>Customer ability to check their order status</LI>
<LI>Eliminate unnecessary database entries</LI>
<LI>Automate as many necessary entries as possible</LI>
<LI>Generate forms from a web-based interface</LI>
<LI>Generate letters automatically when necessary</LI>
<LI>Notify customers via e-mail when their equipment arrives</LI></UL>
</UL>


<P>The new Perl application was built around a database.  It was
actually a flat-file text database. There were two data files that we
used; open and closed.  The open database had around 1,000 records, and
the closed database had around 6,000 records.  Each record had 33
fields.  (In retrospect, I might not do it with text files again.  On a
smaller project, text files are fine but something of this
size should have been on a real database.)  Overall, the speed wasn't
a problem since 95% of what we did was on the smaller, open database file.
</P>

<P>Our personnel were able to create and update database entries
from their web browser.   The application also created forms
and other documents that they needed.  For instance, we generated
printable order forms compatible with the Delrina Form Flow software 
that was in place for creating equipment orders.  We also
stored the form data so that forms could be called up and changed
or reprinted at a later time.  </P>

<P>We also handled other documents in Rich Text
Format (RTF), which the Perl application could easily manipulate.
We could modify the RTF files on the fly
and send the results to the client for printing.</P>

<P>Once the equipment arrived on site, our personnel 
used the Web interface to bring up the order number, 
check which items had come in and the database was updated. 
Perhaps the best feature was that the customers were automatically 
e-mailed a message that listed the items that had come in.</P>

<P><font size=+2>This solution saved us</font> 
an <I>official</I> estimate of 900
man-hours per year. That is all that I could justify on paper.  I
personally think that this estimate was low.  It simplified so many
areas of the ordering process that I could safely say it saved
well over 1,500 man-hours per year.  </P>

<P>Not only did it save time:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Our customers were able to check the status of their orders from their desktop</LI>
<LI>Our customers got the most current information available</LI>
<LI>The database integrity was greatly improved</LI>
<LI>The manual database updates were cut down from 13 to 5</LI>
<LI>Many database functions were masked behind the web interface</LI>
<LI>Saved 20-30 phone calls per week because customers could check status on their own</LI></UL>


<P>This is just one example of how Perl can be used to create 
programs that simplify difficult processes and save time and money for
any organization.   
Sure, there are many other languages and commercial applications
that you can choose to develop in, but they too have pros and cons.  
I have had many of the more <I>seasoned</I> web 
developers ask me <I>&quot;why don't I develop in Java?&quot;</I>  
I ask them back &quot;<I>Why don't you develop in Perl?&quot;</I>  
I have never been faced with a Web application that 
I could not do in Perl. 
</P>

            <!-- Perl Builder IDE Debuts -->


<BR>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Overview:</B><BR>
Perl Builder, by <A HREF="http://www.solutionsoft.com">Solutionsoft</A>, is 
the first integrated development environment (IDE) for Perl. It allows you to 
develop and test Perl applications in a Windows 95/98/NT environment.</font></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Test
Equipment:</B><BR> I tested Perl Builder on a machine with a Cyrix
6x86/200MHz processor and 48Mb RAM using Windows 95 and then the same
machine using Windows 98. Both of these test machines used the
ActiveState Perl port. I also tested Perl Builder on a Pentium 166 with
96Mb RAM running Windows NT. This machine used the latest Gurusamy
Sarathy port of Perl.</FONT></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="2"><b>Installation:</b><br> Installing Perl Builder took about 5
minutes. It was very simple and I had no installation problems. I was
surprised by the nice, clean interface and yet the program was only
around 750kb in size before installation! To me, this is remarkable in
an age where IDE's can easily take over 100Mb of space. Granted, Perl
Builder is really just a text editor that integrates with Perl so there
are no libraries or any Perl-related files included with the
program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To use Perl
Builder, you need to have Perl installed on your system. You can use
either the ActiveState Perl port or the &quot;Gurusamy Sarathy&quot;
port of Perl. Neither of which come with Perl Builder, but Solutionsoft
does provide links so that you can easily download them. I recommend
the &quot;Gurusamy Sarathy&quot; version.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once installed,
my first task was to run through the tutorial provided. The tutorial
walks you through creating a &quot;mailto&quot; form using an HTML form
that they provide. It worked as advertised and was an easy-to-follow
tutorial that provides you with a good overview of the IDE. </font></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Programming
Environment</B><BR> Perl Builder is basically a text editor that has
been written specifically for writing Perl scripts. Perl Builder
provides a simple programming environment that is easy to get
comfortable with. The different windows in the IDE are
&quot;tabbed&quot; for easy access. The normal tabs are <I>Main Script,
Input Values, </I>and <I>Output:  HTML/Text</I>. Other tabs,
like <I>errors,</I> are added as needed.</FONT></p>

<P>
<IMG src="/pub/1998/07/graphics/perlbuilder.gif" ALT="The Perl Builder Window" HEIGHT="327" WIDTH="450"><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>
Figure 1: Perl Builder's visual editor</B></FONT>
</P>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The <I>Main
Script</I> tab is the area where you actually write the script. The
code that you write is automatically color-coded by Perl Builder and
the colors are user-customizeable Having color-coded Perl code makes
viewing the code much easier. I found that once you get accustomed to
the colors, you can quickly scan the code for what you are looking
for.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The <I>Input
Values</I>tab allows you to specify either the values that you
would have sent from an HTML form if you are writing a CGI script. Or,
from STDIN if you are writing a non-CGI script.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The <I>Output</I>
tab shows you what output your Perl application produced. If you are
writing a CGI script, there is a button on this tab that allows you to
view the code in a web browser. Perl Builder actually takes the output
from your script, and produces a local HTML file for the browser
view.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The <I>Errors</I>
tab does exactly what you would expect it to do, it shows you any
errors that were generated by your script. The feature I liked here is
that you can double-click on the error, and you are taken right to that
line of code on the <I>Main Script</I> tab.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When a CGI script
generates one or more e-mail messages, Perl Builder also provides a tab
that shows you what the e-mail(s) would look like.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Debugging</B><BR> Perl Builder includes some great features
for debugging your code. You can set breakpoints, watches, step through
your code or do just about anything that an IDE debugger should do. You
can also run with &quot;strict&quot; or evaluate your code with the -w
flag. </FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Nice
Features</B><BR> Perl Builder has many nice features. My favorites
were:</FONT></p>

<UL>
<LI><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Editor-scripts<BR> </FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica,
sans-serif" SIZE="2">The <I>Editor-scripts</I> menu item, my favorite
tool, allows you to write Perl scripts that will be performed on your
code. Solutionsoft includes a few like block-comment and
block-uncomment. I wrote a quick one that allows me to add line-numbers
to my code and replace all of the &lt; and &gt;'s in my code with their
HTML equivalents. This saves me a great deal of time when I write code
for articles. Now I just highlight the code, and let Perl Builder do
everything for me.

<P>To use the editor scripts, all you do is highlight the code you
want to perform the action on, and choose the appropriate item from the
menu. The code is executed only on the part of your script that you
highlighted. Plus, you don't have to learn any new &quot;scripting
languages&quot;, it is all customized with Perl code. </FONT></LI>

<P> 
<LI><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Regular Expression Search/Replace<BR></FONT></I>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This feature allows
you to use the power of Perl and create complex search/replace regular
expressions that are executed on your script.</FONT></LI>

<P> 
<LI><I><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">CGI Wizard<BR>
</FONT></I>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The CGI Wizard in
Perl Builder allows even non-programmers to write CGI scripts that can
accept HTML form data, validate the entries, e-mail multiple messages
to multiple recipients and generate response pages on-the-fly. The CGI
Wizard steps you through the process and does 99% of the work for you.
All you have to do is choose an HTML form, the wizard imports the
variables and then steps you through the rest of the
process.</FONT></LI> 
</UL> 
<p>
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Weaknesses</B><BR>
  Perl Builder is a great product, but there were a few items that I'd like to see addressed. </FONT></p> 

<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The menu bar at
the top of the IDE did not have a <I>print</I> button. I like to print
my code out and draw all over it, while this is just a minor detail,
I'd like to see it added.</FONT></LI>

<P> 
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When generating
forms on-the-fly, Perl Builder only allows you to create and test the
first form.  You cannot test scripts on code that was dynamically
generated. The ability to test the dynamically generated forms would
add to the complexity of the program, but it is needed to fully test
CGI scripts. I write many scripts that dynamically generate HTML forms
and call themselves with these new forms.</FONT></LI>

<P> 

<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When using the
watch portion of the debugger, I found that when I closed the watch
window I began getting errors from Perl even though none of the code
had changed. I found that if I closed Perl Builder and restarted it,
all was well again.</FONT></LI>

<P> 
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I also ran into
a few graphic glitches while using the program. The graphic problems
were much better than in the beta that I had tested previously but they
were still annoying.  I am confident that as this program evolves, this
is still version 1.0 of the program, these glitches will be worked
out.</FONT></LI>
</UL> 

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Wrapping It Up</B><BR>

Overall, Perl Builder is a great program and is something that should
have been developed a long time ago. It is a great tool for both
beginning Perl programmers, and experienced Perl programmers. Perl
Builder's clean interface and powerful features take much of the
unnecessary work out of Perl programming.</FONT></p>

<p>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While it is not
perfect, and can't handle some of the more complex Perl programs, it is
a great environment for developing most of your CGI scripts. The
ability to easily test your scripts locally is something that makes CGI
programming much easier. 
</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The price for
Perl Builder is $149. Although I think that the price is reasonable, I
think it would do better if the price was around the $99 range. Perl
developers have become accustomed to free software and I think that
they may have a hard time spending almost $150 for a &quot;helper&quot;
program.  
</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Overall, I give Perl Builder a 4.5 out of 5 camel rating.</FONT></p> 

<p>
<I>Author's note: I was contacted by Solutionsoft and told that a version 1.0a would be released sometime this week.  Version 1.0a is supposed to fix many of the bugs that we found in version 1.0.  An update to this article will be added
when I have had a chance to evaluate the new version.</I>
