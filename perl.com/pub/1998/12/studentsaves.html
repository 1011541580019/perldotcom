<h2>Nebraska High School Student <br>
  Volunteers His Perl Expertise to Save Hospital</h2>
<p><i>As a longtime user and admirer of O'Reilly books and an enthusiastic Perl 
  programmer, I read www.Perl.com regularly. I recently had a small part in a 
  Perl success story that I would like to share with the Perl community. In a 
  quick summary, a high school student with Perl programming skills solved a text-processing 
  problem for a local hospital that saved them hours of work, and with no cost 
  since it was a volunteer project. -- </i>Steven R. Dunbar, J. D. Edwards Honors 
  Program, University of Nebraska-Lincoln. </p>
<p>Andy Rutledge is a senior at Lincoln East High School in Lincoln, Nebraska. 
  Andy completed his volunteer hours for the Lincoln Public Schools Citizenship 
  Issues Class at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in the Management Information 
  Systems area in Autumn 1998. </p>
<p>Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital needed an easier way for employees to access 
  the electronic policies and procedures files. The solution was to design a Web 
  page that allowed employees to search by topic. In order to build this solution, 
  the hospital needed someone with the programming skills to take the original 
  documents in a word-processor format and convert them to separate documents 
  for the Web. </p>
<p>Andy, who already had all the necessary Perl programming skills, volunteered 
  for the project. Charlene Dunbar, Medical Records Administrator, co-directed 
  Andy ’s work on this project. Andy applied his Perl programming skills and within 
  a few dedicated hours wrote a Perl program for the task. The program converted 
  11 large text files with 2,000 individual sections into 2,000 HTML files with 
  consistent naming and automatic creation of a table of contents. He used Perl 
  regular expressions and accomplished the task of dividing the files, naming 
  them consistently, and generating a table of contents with just 200 lines of 
  code. This program was compact and efficient and ran smoothly. </p>
<p>Since the programming went so fast and worked so well, Andy had volunteer hours 
  left over. Andy helped design the search page and the underlying indexing of 
  the files which then provided a "user friendly" interface to the thousands of 
  procedures at Madonna.</p>
