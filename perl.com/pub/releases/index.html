        <div class="asset-body">
            <p> It's been nearly six months since the release of Perl 5.8.0, but
many people still haven't upgraded to it. We'll take a look at some of
the new features it provides and describe why you should investigate
them yourself.
</p>
<h2><a name="unicode">Unicode</a></h2>

    <p>Perl 5.8 - at last! - properly supports Unicode. Handling
    Unicode data in Perl should now be much more reliable than in
    5.6.0 and 5.6.1. In fact, quoting the most excellent
    <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perluniintro.html">perluniintro.pod</a>, which is suggested reading, '5.8 is the first
    recommended release for serious Unicode work.'</p>


    <p>The <a href="http://www.unicode.org/ucd/">Unicode Character
    Database</a>, which ships with Perl, has been upgraded to Unicode
    3.2.0, 5.6.1 had 3.0.1. Most UCD files are included with some
    omissions for space considerations.</p>

    <p>Perl's Unicode model is straightforward: Strings can be
    eight-bit native bytes or strings of Unicode characters. The
    principle is that Perl tries to keep its data as eight-bit bytes
    for as long as possible. When Unicodeness cannot be avoided, the
    data is transparently upgraded to Unicode. Native eight-bit bytes
    are whatever the platform users (for example Latin-1), Unicode is
    typically stored as UTF-8.</p> 

    <p>Perl will do the right thing with regard to mixing Unicode and
    non-Unicode strings; all functions and operators will respect the
    UTF-8 flag. For example, it is now possible to use Unicode strings
    in hashes, and correctly use them in regular expressions and
    transliterations. This has fully changed from 5.6 where you
    controlled Unicode support with a lexically scoped <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6.1/lib/utf8.html"><code>utf8</code></a>
    pragma.</p>

<p> To fully use Unicode in Perl, we must now compile Perl with
<code>perlio</code> -- the new IO system written by Nick Ing-Simmons
that we will cover later -- together with the new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/DANKOGAI/Encode-1.84/Encode.pm">Encode
module</a> written by Dan Kogai. Together, these allow individual
filehandles to be set to bytes, Unicode or legacy encodings. Encode
also comes with <code>piconv</code>, which is a Perl implementation of
iconv and <code>enc2xs</code>, which allows you to create your own
encodings to Encode, either from Unicode Character Mapping files or
from Tcl Encoding Files. From Sadahiro Tomoyuki comes <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SADAHIRO/Unicode-Normalize-0.17/"><code>Unicode::Normalize</code></a>
and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SADAHIRO/Unicode-Collate-0.23/"><code>Unicode::Collate</code></a>,
surprisingly used for normalization and collating.</p>

<h2>Perl Threads</h2> 

<p>Just like 5.8 is the first recommended release for Unicode work, it
is also the first recommended release for threading work. Starting
with 5.6, Perl had two modes of threading: one style called
<code>5005threading</code>, mainly because it was introduced with
5.005, and ithreads, which is short for interpreter threads. Gurusamy
Sarathy introduced ithreads as a step forward from multiplicity to
support the psuedofork implementation on Win32. However, in 5.6, there
was no way to control these threads from Perl; this has now
changed with the introduction of two new modules in 5.8.</p> 

<p>The basic rule for this thread model is that all data is cloned
when a new thread is created, so no data is shared between threads. If
one wants to share data, then there is a <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/threads/shared.html"><code>threads::shared</code>
module</a> and the new <code>: shared</code>; variable
attribute. Controlling the new threads is done by using the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/threads.html"><code>threads</code></a>
module. More reading can be found in the respective modules and
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlthrtut.html">the Perl Thread Tutorial page</a></p>.

<h2>New IO</h2> 

<p>Perl can now rely on its own bugs instead of the bugs of your
underlying IO implementation! In Perl 5.8, we are now using the PerlIO library,
which replaces both stdio and sfio. The new IO system allows filters
to be pushed/popped from a filehandle for doing all kinds of nifty
things. For example, the Encode module, as mentioned earlier in
the Unicode discussion, uses PerlIO to do the magic character set
conversions at the IO level.</p> 

<p>Interested parties that want to create their own layers should look
at <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlapio.html">the
library API</a>, <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perliol.html">the IO layer
API</a>, <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/PerlIO.html">the PerlIO
module</a>, and <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/PerlIO/via.html">the
PerlIO::via manpage</a>.</p>

<h2>Safe
Signals</h2> 

<p>No more random segfaults caused by signals! We now have a signal
handler that just raises a flag and then dispatches the signal between
opcodes so you are free to do anything you feel like in a signal
handler (Since it isn't run at async time, it isn't really a signal
handler). This has potential for conflicts if you are embedding Perl
and relying on signals to do some particular behavior, but I suppose if
you really like having the chance of a random segfault on receiving a
signal, then you can always compile perl with PERL_OLD_SIGNALS. This will, however,
not be threadsafe.</p>

<p>New and Improved Modules</p> 

<p>Perl 5.8 comes with 54 new modules,
many of them are included of CPAN for various reasons. One goal has
been to make it easy for <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/CPAN.html">CPAN.pm</a> to be selfhosting; this has meant including
libnet and a couple of other modules.</p>

<p>
 We have been working on testing
a lot so the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/Test/More.html"><code>Test::More</code></a> family of modules were natural to include.
Then there was a push to make Perl more i18n friendly, so 5.8.0 includes
several i18n and l10n modules as well as the previously covered
Unicode modules. There many modules that provide access to
internal functions like the PerlIO modules, threads module and sort,
the new module that provides a interface to the sort implementation
you are using. Finally, we also thought it was time to include <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/Storable.html"><code>Storable</code></a>
in the core.</p> 

<p>We also have a bunch of updated modules included: <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/Cwd.html"><code>Cwd</code></a>
is now implemented in XS, giving us a nice speed boost. <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/B/Deparse.html"><code>B::Deparse</code></a>
has been improved to the point that it is actually useful. Maintenance work
on <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html"><code>
ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code></a> has made it more stable. Storable
supports Unicode hash keys and restricted hashes. <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/Math/BigInt.html"><code>Math::BigInt</code></a>
and <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/Math/BigFloat.html"><code>Math::BigFloat</code>
manpage</a> have been upgraded and bugfixed quite a lot, and they have
been complemented by a <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib//Math/BigRat.html"><code>Math::BigRat</code></a> module,
and the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/bigrat.html"><code>bigrat</code></a>, 
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/bigint.html"><code>bigint</code></a> and
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/bignum.html"><code>bignum</code></a> pragmata 
for lexical control of transparent bignumber support.</p>

<h2>Speed Improvements</h2> 

<p>Even if this release includes a lot of new features, there are some
optimizations in there as well! We have changed sort to use mergesort,
which for me is rather surprising since I have been told since I was a
toddler to use quicksort. However, the old behavior can be controlled
using the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/sort.html"><code>sort</code></a>
module; we even have a mystery stable quicksort!</p>

<p>Once again, we have changed the hashing algorithm to
something called One-At-A-Time, so all of you who depend on the order
of hashes, this is a good reason to fix your programs now!</p>

 <p>Finally, <code>map</code> has been made faster, as has
 <code>unshift</code>.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

 <p>We
hope this should be the most stable release of Perl to date, as an
extensive QA effort has been spearheaded by Michael Schwern that has
led to several benefits. We now have six times the amount of test cases,
testing a cleaner codebase with more documentation. The Perl Bug
database has been switched to <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/">Request Tracker</a>; we should thank
Richard Foley for his work on perlbugtron, which has now been retired.
After several discussions on what a memory leak is, several memory
leaks and naughty accesses have been fixed. Tools used have been third
degree, purify, and the most excellent open-source alternative,
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/">valgrind</a>.</p>

<h2>More Numbers</h2> 

<p>Nicholas Clark, Hugo van der Sanden and Tels have done
some magic keeping integers as integers as long as possible, and when
finding bugs in vendors number-to-string and string-to-number they
have coded around these to increased precision. We should all be happy
that 42 is now 42 and not 42.000000000000001 - imagine what the aliens
would do if they found out!</p> 

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>I have
mentioned several documentations pages earlier, they are part of the
13 new POD files included in Perl; in addition to this, all README.os
files have been translated into pod. Interestingly, there are several
new tutorials, including <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlretut.html">a regular expressions tutorial</a>, <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlpacktut.html">a tutorial on pack and unpack</a>,
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perldebtut.html">a debugging tutorial</a>, <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlnewmod.html">a module creation tutorial</a>, and <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlintro.html">'a gentle introduction to
perl'</a>. There is also a new 
<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlpodspec.html">POD format specification</a>
written by Sean M. Burke.</p>

<h2>Deprecations</h2> 

<p>Several deprecations have occurred in this release of Perl. In
future versions of Perl, 5005threads will be gone and replaced by
ithreads. Pseudo-hashes will be killed but the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/fields.html">fields</a> pragma
will work using restricted hashes; suidperl, which, despite everything,
isn't safe and the bare <code>package;</code> directive, which had unclear semantics.</p> 

<p>A few things have been removed and forbidden: blessing a refence into
another ref is one; self-tying of arrays and hashes led to some weird
bugs and have been disabled, as they touched some rarely tested
codepaths. The <code>[[.c.]]</code> and <code>[[=c=]]</code> character classes are also
forbidden because they might be used for future extensions. Several
scripts that were outdated have been removed and the upper case
comparison operators have also got the ax.</p> 

<h2>The War of the Platforms</h2> 

<p>Perl 5.8 works on several new platforms and the EBDIC
platforms were regained. However, sadly we lost Amiga; so any volunteers that
want to make the Amiga port work again are very welcome.</p> 

<h2>Odd and Ends</h2> <p>
There is a long list of new small changes in Perl 5.8,
the biggest of these small changes are restricted hashes, which can be
used from the new <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/lib/Hash/Util.html"><code>Hash::Util</code></a>
module and allows you to lock down the keys in a specific hash; this will
possibly be used as a replacement for pseudohashes for the
<em>fields</em> pragma.</p>

<blockquote><em>"What *is* going on over there, anyway? It is unfortunately 
  true that the effort looks stalled from the outside."</em> 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Eric S. Raymond, to the <a   href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-meta@perl.org/msg00622.html">perl6-meta</a> 
  mailing list </em></blockquote>
<p>The push towards the next major version of perl started with a bang -- 
literally, thanks to Jon Orwant and his <a 
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-meta@perl.org/msg00409.html">now-infamous</a> 
coffee-mug-tossing act. Mailing lists were set up, a flurry of RFCs were 
submitted, and now, almost five months since the RFC process ended... Quiet. 
What *is* going on with perl6, anyway?</p>
<p>As it stands now, the silence is mostly due to the fact a lot of the work has 
gone underground. First, of course, we continue to wait eagerly for Larry's 
language design, although as Larry himself <a 
href="http://lwn.net/2001/features/LarryWall/">points out</a>, he's got his 
hands full with the 361 RFCs submitted last fall. Elsewhere, work continues at a 
steady murmur, especially on the <code>perl6-language</code> and 
<code>perl6-internals</code> lists. In particular, the 
<code>perl6-internals</code> group, led by the redoubtable Dan Sugalski, has 
borne some recent fruits, as discussions have started to coalesce into "Perl 
Design Documents," or PDDs.</p>
<p>PDDs are detailed white papers that will hopefully serve as guides when 
people actually sit down to write code. So far, PDDs have been submitted to 
<code>perl6-internals</code> relating to the structures of the interpreter 
itself, and of <code>vtables</code>, which will be used to implement primitive 
variables, like scalars. More PDDs are expected on other language-independent 
features, like garbage collection and I/O abstraction, which will need to be 
implemented somehow, regardless of what Larry's final language design looks 
like. Some preliminary code for the perl6 interpreter might even be written in 
the next month or so, once the existing PDDs are finalized.</p>
<p>So, contrary to all outward appearances, perl6 is indeed alive and well! In 
order to remedy this information deficit, Simon Cozens has stepped forward, and 
volunteered a companion to his perl5-porters digest. As such, the O'Reilly 
Network is pleased to introduce the first edition of the <b>perl6 mailing lists 
digest</b>. Simon plans to set up e-mail distribution (analogous to the p5p 
digest), so we'll be sure to let you know when that happens. Meanwhile, the 
perl6 digest will become a regular weekly feature of www.perl.com, hot off the 
mailing lists to you. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>This week on perl6 (04--11 Feb 2001)</h2>

<p>

Please send corrections and additions to 
<code>perl6-thisweek-YYYYMM@simon-cozens.org</code> where 
<code>YYYYMM</code> is the current year and month.
</p>

<p>
This week was reasonably quiet, seeing around 350 messages in all the
groups. For a change, most of the traffic was on 
<code>perl6-language</code><h3><a name="Autoloading_Modules">Autoloading Modules</a></h3>

</p>

<p>

Last week, Dan asked people to think about ways to autoload modules when
a function was used; the idea being that you'd be able to say, for
instance:
</p>

</p><pre>
    socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto);
</pre>

<p>
(or moral equivalent) and Perl would load in all the socket functions.
This is actually what Perl 5 already does for 
<code>glob</code> and some of the Unicode functionality. Some people went off on a bit of
a tangent and started discussing ways to autoload modules more
generally, by having modules declare what functionality they're providing.
</p>

<p>
One big question for both sub-discussions was how we key the functions to 
code. Jarkko said:
<blockquote></p>

<p>

A gut feeling that I have is we can't simply go by interface 'names',
be they just simple names of funtions/methods or their full
'signatures'
(let us not even start on (1) how difficult with Perl's type system
and functions it is to define signatures (2) the difficulty in
defining an ontology/vocabulary), either would not really be enough.
</p>

<p>
What I think is needed is some sort of opaque tag: the name of the
'contract' the API claims to fulfill.  The name can be the name of 
the standard, the name of the company, the name of the individual.
</blockquote></p>

<p>

Branden suggested that a URI should be used, leading to the inevitable
but still horribly scary notion of
</p>

</p><pre>
    use autoload { Bar => 'http://www.cpan.org/modules/Bar' },
                 { Baz => 'ftp://my.local.domain/perl-modules/Baz', VERSION
                 => 2 };
</pre>

<p>
Various people pointed out that this might not be secure.
<h3><a name="Packaging">Packaging</a></h3>

</p>

<p>

The autoloaded core functions idea got slightly left by the wayside,
as the discussion finally veered off onto how to package up modules and
programs to satisfy dependencies and make things easy for the user. A
setup similar to Java's &quot;jar&quot;s was suggested. Dan came up with the very
simple and neat idea of simply shipping a bytecode compiled version of
a program instead. Schwern was a bit concerned that this would lose
source code and would separate out documentation; Dan's brilliant answer
was: 
<blockquote></p>

<p>
Not unless you strip the bytecode. I want to optionally package the
source in the bytecode, since otherwise you can't do some optimizations
after the fact on the generated bytecode stream.
</blockquote></p>

<p>
He also suggested a text segment in bytecode so that, for instance, you
can still get POD embedded in code.
</p>

<p>
That's something that may well happen anyway, but Branden came back on
the packaging issue. He noted that Dan's suggestion wouldn't help for
modules with C extensions, and also said:
<blockquote></p>

<p>
Actually, I think the archive approach is more general, because it
wouldn't have this kind of problems and would allow other resources to
be deployed together with the code, like documentation, perhaps even
text files and images used by a Perl/Tk application
</blockquote></p>

<p>
Comparisons were made between this and the currently-existing PPM.
Branden produced a 
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg05694.html">draft PDD</a> for his ideas.
<h3><a name="Vtables">Vtables</a></h3>

</p>

<p>

At long last, Dan produced the second PDD, specifying 
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg02305.html">the vtable API</a>. As expected, this exposed a lot of hidden confusion about what vtables are
for and how they're going to be handled. Tim piped up with a few
questions and corrections, including a discussion about how string
handling is going to work, especially string encoding. Dan said he 
deliberately left UTF8 off, because dealing with variable-length data
is horrid. Most people disagreed, saying that UTF32 was too big for most
people, and UTF8 was a good compromise for most data. It was generally
agreed that an abstracted string handling layer would make most of the
problem go away.
</p>

<p>
Edwin Steiner asked whether the vtable API should be made up of macros;
I pointed out that this was the road that Perl 5 went down, and look
what happened to that. Dan also said that there wouldn't be an &quot;API&quot; for
vtables - they're to be used by the Perl guts only.
</p>

<p>
There was still a lot of confusion as to how overloading and aliasing
would be accomplished. Branden came up with an alternative suggestion
for how to handle vtables, which seemed to be rather more high-level.
The current vtable PDD wants to make many core ops a single vtable call
if possible. There seemed to be much confusion about how the <code>key</code> field worked, and what operation was being carried out on what. No
doubt further revisions of the PDD will clear this up. Dan also said
that once the PDD has matured a little more, he wants to start writing
code for the base classes. We're nearly there, guys</p>.
<h3><a name="Subroutine_return_values">Subroutine return values</a></h3>



<p>

There was a lot of light but very little heat in the continuing saga of
assigning to a magic return value variable. Some people seem to want to
do this:
</p>

<pre>
    sub foo {
        foo = 10;
    }
</pre>

<p>
instead of 
<code>return 10</code>, just like Pascal, Algol and all those other failed, now-dead
languages.
</p>

<p>
A (slightly) better suggestion was a magic variable to hold the return
value, similar to what 
<code>Parse::RecDescent</code> (and of course, 
<code>yacc</code>) does. The names 
<code>$__</code> and 
<code>$^R</code> were suggested, but there was no consensus on whether or not it would
even be a good idea.</p> 
<h3><a name="End_of_Scope_Actions">End of Scope Actions</a></h3>

<p>

A far better idea came out when people stopped looking at what they
wanted and started looking at why they wanted it. A lot of the value in
having a assignable return value is in the situation of subroutines
which set something up, compute, and then turn it down again. Another
way of looking at that was to stipulate a block executed at the end of
the scope, like this:
</p>

<pre>
    sub lines {
        open IN, $_ or die $!;
        return scalar(&lt;in>);
    }
    post lines { # This is executed on return
        close IN;
    }
</pre>

<p>
Damian had, of course, thought ahead, and this is covered by his 
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/271.html">RFC 271</a>. However, he agreed that post-block actions should be allowed
everywhere, not just on subroutines. The 
<code>always</code> keyword was agreed upon as a good way of doing this, although
<code>POST</code> was also suggested. This lead to the
semi-inevitable rehash of the 
<code>try</code>-
<code>catch</code> exception handling debate. According to John Porter,</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
There is no 
<code>try</code>, there is only 
<code>do</code>. :-)

<h3><a name="Garbage_Collection">Garbage Collection</a></h3>

<p>

Jamie Zawinski published his 
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/java.html">rant about Java</a>, which caused certain sensible people to ponder how to make sure Perl
avoids the same mistakes. A few of the things mentioned included
platform independence, the size of SVs, locking, but the discussion
settled down to garbage collection, as rather a lot of discussions on 
<code>perl6-internals</code> are wont to do. (Oh, this was on 
<code>perl6-language</code>. Ho hum.)
</p>

<p>
The trigger was a question from Branden:</p>
<blockquote>
I actually don't understand how traversing a graph can be faster than
incrementing/decrementing/testing for zero on a refcount. I believe you,
but I just don't understand. Could you point me to some URLs that talk
about this?
</blockquote></p>

<p>
and a masterful answer from Piers:
</p><blockquote>

<p>
There's a jolly good book on this called (would you believe) 'Garbage
Collection'. The crux of the matter would appear to be that with
refcounts you have to do a pretty small amount of work very, very
often. With a well designed GC system you do a largish amount of work
much less frequently. The total amount of work done tends to come out
higher in the refcounting scenario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was coupled with a  
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg05693.html">more comprehensive answer</a> from Ken Fox. Dan said he wanted to put GC-related data at the end of a
variable, so that it didn't always get loaded into memory. He also
pointed out that</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
The less memory you chew through the faster your code will probably be
(or at least you'll have less overhead). Reuse is generally faster and less
resource-intensive than recycling. What's true for tin cans is true for
memory.
</blockquote></p>

<p>
and hinted that Perl 6 is likely to be using a generational semi-space
garbage collection scheme.
<h3><a name="kdb">kdb</a></h3>

</p>

<p>

Joshua Pritikin mentioned 
<a href="http://www.kx.com/">kdb</a>, but had to be tortured before he would explain why. It eventually
became clear he was talking about the K language and its interesting
data model; he says:
<blockquote></p>

<p>
Whether K is ultimately a failure or not, i find it to be an interesting
mix of design trade-offs.  Of course i'd have to use it in a real
project to offer a detailed report of its weaknesses.
</blockquote><h3><a name="ESR_on_Perl_6">ESR on Perl 6</a></h3>

<p>

Eric Raymond released two more chapters of his on-line book 
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/taoup">The Art of Unix Programming</a>, something Perl 6 people would do well to read. Unfortunately, he
wasn't particularly complimentary about Perl, claiming that both Perl 5
and Perl 6 are currently stagnant and stalled. This led to a rather
acrimonious discussion about our public image, and it was resolved that
these summaries might help us let the public know what's going on. So
here we are.

<blockquote><i>`Darn it, who spiked my coffee with water?!'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, it's been two years in the making. Everyone's favourite Swiss
Army Chainsaw is coming up to thirteen years old now, and would be about to
show the world a brand new face for the new millennium if that didn't start
next year instead of this one. If, like me, you remember the day that the
combined might of Malcolm and Sarathy produced the last major release of
Perl, you might be wondering what's happened since then. Allow me, then, to
present to you the wonderful world of 5.6.0!</p>

<h3><a name="Unicode_Perl_goes_internationa">Unicode - Perl goes international!</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`It's kind of weird to read a standards document that has all these
instance of &quot;Oh, by the way, Perl does it this way instead.&quot;'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
The largest change in Perl 5.6 has to be the introduction of UTF-8 Unicode
support. By default, Perl now thinks in terms of Unicode characters instead
of simple bytes; a character can, as the CJK people already know extremely
well, span several bytes. All the relevant built-in functions (<code>length</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and so on) now work on a character-by-character basis instead of byte-by-byte, and strings are represented internally in Unicode.</p>

<p>
Two new pragmata, <em>byte</em> and <em>utf8</em>, have been written to control the Unicode settings; <code>use byte</code> will go back to the old default of reading a byte at a time, whereas <code>use utf8</code> turns on support for UTF8 characters in the source code of a program
itself. The <em>utf8</em> pragma also loads in the character tables, but this is done automatically
by Perl on demand.</p>

<p>
What does it actually mean, then? So things are encoded in Unicode
internally, what does this enable me as a programmer to do? Well, if we
turn on utf8, we can specify string literals in Unicode using the
<code>\x{}</code> notation; just put your character codes in hexadecimal inside the brackets.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre> $glis =
 &quot;\x{395}\x{3CD}\x{3B1}\x{3B3}\x{3B3}\x{3B5}\x{3BB}\x{3CA}\x{3B1}&quot;;
</pre>
</code>
<p>
You can also reference Unicode characters by their name: the
<em>charnames</em> pragma loads in the list of names, allowing you to then say something like <code>&quot;\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>
Next, if you've got a Unicode editor, you can now, just like Java, use any
Unicode for all your identifiers. This currently needs <code>use utf8</code>
to enable Unicode in your source, but is expected to become standard very
soon; the <em>utf8</em> pragma is attempting to make itself redundant.</p>

<p>
Unicode support for regular expressions is now in, and supports matching
characters based on Unicode properties - you can now match any upper-case
character in any language with <code>\p{IsUpper}</code>. Characters, rather than bytes, are matched by <code>\w</code>, which is a superb thing for the Japanese and other multiple-byte worlds.
Best of all, the new match
<code>\X</code> will snatch any character plus all the attributes (markings, breathings,
and so on) that apply to it.</p>

<p>
Translation is fully supported: whether you mean translation from Unicode
to ordinary 8-bit and back, or upper/lower case translation. For the
former, the <code>tr///</code> operator can be given the UC and CU modifiers to translate from Unicode to
8-bit characters (`chars') and back. As for casifying, <code>uc</code>, <code>lc</code> and friends Do The Right Thing for all upper and lower case characters
specified in the Unicode translation tables.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to tell Perl that incoming data
from an external file is Unicode; while you can write Unicode data out to a
file, you cannot read Unicode data back in again. While you can work around
this with <code>tr///CU</code>, it's obviously a serious shortcoming, which we hope will be addressed
soon.</p>

<p>
In short, it should be a lot easier for us who have to deal regularly with
multiple-byte alphabets to do so, to manipulate and process data. A new
documentation page, <em>perlunicode</em>, fully documents all the new support.</p>

<h3><a name="Better_Building">Better Building</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote>`I'd be slow to label Configure as &quot;bilge&quot;. that's unnecessarily insulting to all the maintainers of Configure (and metaconfig).
Configure is lovingly crafted, highly knowledgable bilge.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
As usual, Perl now supports more computers than ever before, with the
addition of six new supported platforms; notably, the GNU/Hurd is now
supported, as is the Psion 5.</p>

<p>
Configure finally allows you to look in directories used in old versions of
Perl to search for modules; the split between core modules,
architecture-specific modules and locally added modules is now more
clear-cut. This makes it a lot cleaner and easier to upgrade your Perl
distribution, without having to worry about the modules you've installed
for older versions.</p>

<p>
Perl can now also take advantage of those architectures which use 64 bit
integers (quads) if you use the <code>-Duse64bits</code> flag to Configure, and so you can now do your integer arithmetic with
values up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 instead of a measly 2,147,483,648.</p>

<p>
Similarly, Perl can now process files larger than 2 gigabytes on computers
that support them. Just add <code>-Duselargefiles</code> to your Configure, and off you go.</p>

<p>
Finally, floating point support is enhanced on those computers which
support the `long double' variable type, and we're also starting to see the
beginnings of cross-compiling options appear in Configure.</p>

<p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3><a name="Threading">Threading</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`Here be dragons'</i> - thread.h
</blockquote>
<p>
Perl's threading has been drastically reworked. It's still experimental,
and there's still every expectation that the current implementation may be
thrown out and started again, but Perl now supports two different types of
threads.</p>

<p>
Firstly, we've got the threads that existed in Perl 5.005 - your program
can thread, and each thread can have its own variables and stashes,
controlled with the <em>Thread</em> module as before, and these threads have become slightly more stable - but
we also now have interpreter-based threads.</p>

<p>
In this model, the entire Perl interpreter gets cloned and runs in a
separate thread. At the moment, however, there's no way to create a new
thread from Perl space, so it's not what you want if you're trying to play
with threaded programs, but what it does mean is that platforms such as
Windows that don't support the <code>fork()</code> system call can have an emulated fork by cloning the entire perl
interpreter; each `pseudo-process' then emulates the properties on an
independent process. It's a huge hack, but it works.</p>

<p>
As well as enhanced threading support, we now have support for
`multiplicity'. What this means is that not only can you have two
interpreters in separate threads that have a common ancestry, you can have
completely separate and independent interpreters inside the same process.
Again, there is no interface to this from Perl space; if you want to use
threads in your program, you'll need to turn on the old 5.005 threads;
they're still an experimental feature, so
<em>caveat programmor</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="Improved_Compiler">Improved Compiler</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`Perl has a long tradition of working around compilers'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
Full kudos is due to Vishal Bhatia and Nick Ing-Simmons for their work on
the Perl compiler; it's come on in leaps and bounds since the last release.
While it's still not ready for prime time, the Perl-to-C compiler now
passes a fair amount of the standard Perl test suite, and can even be used
to compile (some) Tk programs. The `optimised C' compiler is also slightly
more stable, but some problems have been reported.</p>

<p>
The usual provisos apply: your program may not be any faster or smaller
than an uncompiled version. (Quick tests show that a simple program - <em>op/recurse.t</em> in the test suite - is a few milliseconds faster when compiled; it's also a
quarter of a megabyte on this computer and took 70 seconds to compile.)
Compiling a program still means embedding the Perl interpreter inside it -
we're not even dreaming of producing native assembler or C code
translations of a Perl program yet.</p>

<p>
The new <em>perlcompile</em> documentation explains what's going on.

<h3><a name="Version_Tuples">Version Tuples</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`That is a known bug in 5.00550.  Either an upgrade or a downgrade
will fix it.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
Perl's version numbers have always been a little bizarre; this version
marks a move away from the <code>x.yyy_zz</code> format towards the more standard major-minor-patchlevel format.
Even-numbered minor versions, such as 5.6.0, will be the stable versions,
with the odd-numbered minor versions making up the development stream; now
5.6.0 is released, work will begin on 5.7.0 - this follows the format of
many other open source projects.</p>

<p>
Together with this, a new method of specifying strings has been created - a
literal such as <code>v5.6.0</code>, for example, will be interpreted as a Unicode string made up of three
characters: character 5, character 6 and character 0. This allows one to
compare version numbers using the string comparison operators, and provides
a more readable way of writing long Unicode literals; the string above can
also be specified as

<p>
<code>
<pre>
     $glis = v917.973.945.947.947.949.955.970.947;
</pre>
</code>
<p>
<code>printf</code> and <code>sprintf</code> have now had the <code>v</code> flag added to their format specifications, which allows you to go the other
way: to turn a string into a series of numbers separated by periods - it's
effectively
<code>join &quot;.&quot;, map {ord} split //, $_</code>
</p>


<p>
<code>
<pre>  print  &quot;Perl version: $^V\n&quot;;    # This gives you a messy string!
  printf &quot;Perl version: %vd\n&quot;, $^V;  # Perl version 5.6.0
</pre>
</code>
<p>
This is ideal for any number of things which are specified in such a
format, such as IP addresses:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>     use Socket;
     printf &quot;%vd&quot;, (gethostbyname(&quot;www.perl.com&quot;))[4];
</pre>
</code>
<p>
The new syntax takes a bit of getting used to, it has to be said; most
people won't be using it, but it's a neat trick if you can get your head
around it.</p>

<h3><a name="Lexical_Warnings">Lexical Warnings</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>'Death is not good.  I reject death.  I will stay away from trucks
today.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
The way Perl generates warnings has also been completely revised: as a
replacement for the <code>-w</code> flag and the <code>$^W</code> special variable, the
<code>warnings</code> pragma gives you more flexibility about what warnings you receive and when.</p>

<p>
In terms of <strong>what</strong>, you can now specify warnings by category: there are a bunch of standard
categories, such as 'syntax', 'io', 'void', and modules will be able to
define their own categories. You can also choose to escalate any categories
of warning into a fatal error.</p>

<p>
As for <strong>when</strong>, the pragma is lexically scoped, so you can switch it on and off as you
wish:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>     use warnings;
</pre>
<p>
<pre>     $a = @a[1];      # This generates a warning.
</pre>
<p>
<pre>     {
          no warnings;
          $a = @a[1];  # This does not.
     }
</pre>
</code>
<p>
See <em>perllexwarn</em> for how to use this from programs and modules.</p>

<h3><a name="Lvaluable_Subroutines">Lvaluable Subroutines</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote></i>'I surely do hope that's a syntax error.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
From the department of bizarre syntax, subroutines can now be legal
lvalues; that means they can be assigned to. Of course, this only works if
they return something assignable, and if they're marked as an lvalue
subroutine. For example, normally, you'd have something like this:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre> 
     my $a = 10;
     my $b = 20;

     sub mysub {
          if ($_[0] &gt; 0) { return $a } else { return $b }
     }

     print mysub( 2); # Returns 10
     print mysub(-1); # Returns 20
</pre></code>
<p>
What you can now do is this:

<p><code>
<pre>
     sub mysub : lvalue {
          if ($_[0] &gt; 0) { return $a } else { return $b }
     }

     mysub(2)  = 15; # Set $a to 15
     mysub(-1) =  9; # Set $b to 9
</pre></code>
<p>
That is, the function returns not a value, but the variable itself.
</p>
<p>
This is still an experimental feature, and may go away in the future; it's
also not possible to return array or hash variables yet.
</p>
<p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3><a name="Weak_References">Weak References</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>'I might be able to shoehorn a reference count in on top of the
     numeric value by disallowing multiple references on scalars with a
     numeric value, but it wouldn't be as clean.  I do occasionally worry
     about that.'</i> --lwall</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Perl keeps track of when values are in use and when they can be taken out
of commission by counting the number of references that remain to them. The
problem with this was that if you had a variable that was a reference to
itself, like this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>     $a = \$a;
</pre></code>
<p>
the memory would never be freed even if nothing else referred to it, since
it had a valid existing reference.</p>

<p>
What you can now do is weaken a reference; this means that while it is
still a valid reference, it does not add to the reference count. In the
example above, you could weaken <code>$a</code> and it would be freed once it went out of scope. This also means you can
keep a spare copy of a variable or an object but not interfere with its
lifespan.</p>

<p>
To take advantage of this, you need to install the <em>WeakRef</em> package from CPAN, and read the further documentation there.</p>

<h3><a name="POSIX_Character_Classes">POSIX Character Classes</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>'How do Crays and Alphas handle the POSIX problem?'</i> - lwall</blockquote>

<p>
The Portable Operating Systems Extension (POSIX) standards documents define
a set of named character classes: the class <code>[:upper:]</code>, for example, matches an upper-case character. Of course, Perl supports a
wide range of character classes and can now support matching Unicode
properties too, but it seemed odd that the POSIX standard had not been
implemented, especially since it's familiar to C programmers and used in
standard utilities such as <code>tr</code>. So we implemented it.</p>

<p>
These classes, <code>[:upper:]</code>, <code>[:lower:]</code>, <code>[:digit:]</code> and a bunch of others, actually sit inside ordinary Perl character classes;
as RD Laing said, `now put the brackets in brackets' - to match a
whitespace character, use <code>[[:space:]]</code>. This is equivalent to the Unicode
<code>\p{IsSpace}</code> and the ordinary Perl <code>\s</code>.</p>

<p>
This being Perl, we allow things that POSIX can't do, and you can negate a
POSIX character class with a <code>^</code> before the name. A non-space character can be matched either with <code>[[:^space:]]</code>, <code>\P{IsSpace}</code> or
<code>\S</code>.</p>

<p>
<blockquote><i>'Perl will never turn into APL, despite our best efforts.'</i> - lwall

<p>
Aside from the changes I've just mentioned, there are a myriad of little
things that have been added, improved, and corrected. New documentation has
been written, and older documentation revised; code has been tweaked,
extended, rearranged, and rethought; some small pieces of syntax have been
added or changed; experimental features have been tried, judged and
sentenced.</p>

<p>
While we can't go into all of the less major modifications in the new
version, I'll just pick out some points which may be useful. For the whole
story, you can see the <em>perldelta</em> documentation - for even more of the whole story, read the <em>Changes</em> file in the Perl distribution.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_Binary">Binary Numbers</a></strong><dd>
<p>
As well as being able to specify numbers in decimal (<code>1234</code>), octal (<code>02322</code>) and hexadecimal, (<code>0x4D2</code>) we now have the <code>0b</code> prefix for binary numbers - <code>0b10011010010</code></p>



<p>
While there isn't a <code>bin()</code> function to match <code>hex()</code> and <code>oct()</code>, you can actually make one from the <code>oct()</code> function; <code>oct(&quot;0b1001&quot;)</code>
returns <code>9</code>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_our">our Variables</a></strong><dd>
<p>
Whereas <code>my</code> declares lexical variables, <a href="#item_our">our</a> declares global variables - it's a cleaner and hopefully more intuitive
replacement for
<code>use vars</code>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_File">File Globbing</a></strong><dd>
<p>
The glob operator (<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> and <code>glob</code>) used to be processed by spawning a shell; that was problematic for
operating systems that didn't have a standard shell, and anyway had the
overhead of creating a new process. It's now implemented by calling the
standard <a href="/File/Glob|File/Glob.html">File::Glob|File::Glob</a>

<p>
Most of the bugs, surprises and unpleasantries from 5.005 have been cleared
up; recently there's been quite a blitz on the security of the utilities
that come with Perl, safer handling of temporary files, and tons of work on
debugger, but most of the work of the past year has been clearing up the
issues that you've reported to perl5-porters in the interim. Keep them
coming - it's only by reporting them that they get fixed.</p>

<p>
I'd like to close by commending the great labour of hundreds of porters in
the past year who've worked to bring Perl 5.6 to you, fearlessly led by the
tireless Gurusamy Sarathy, and overseen by the guiding hand of Larry Wall,
and by hoping that this new version will maximise the ease, power, and
above all, enjoyment of your programming.</p>

<p>
May you do Good Magic with Perl... 5.6!
