<p>You have set up and configured various wireless access devices, but could not
find one that included all of the features you needed.
You <em>could</em> wait for a firmware upgrade from your manufacturer, hoping that they
will include the features you want. However, your chances of finding all of your
issues addressed by a new firmware package, if it ever comes out, are slim to none.  Now
is the time to roll up your sleeves and build your own wireless access gateway
from scratch. Don't let this idea scare you; this is all possible thanks to
the open source world.</p>

<p>This article introduces an open source project called <a
href="http://awlp.sourceforge.net/">AWLP</a> (Alptekin's Wireless Linux
Project), which turns a PC with an appropriate wireless LAN card (Prism2/2.5/3)
into a full-featured, web-managed wireless access gateway. That old Pentium 120
machine in your basement might march back up the stairs shortly.</p>

<p>Building your own wireless access device is nothing new. Around three years
ago, Jouni Malinen released <a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/">HostAP</a>, a
Linux driver for wireless LAN cards with Intersil's Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. When
operated in a special mode called Managed, the host computer acts as a wireless
access point. HostAP does its job and does it well, but it is command line only, and 
that's not suitable for everyone.  A complete solution that
potentially competes with off-the-shelf devices needs more features, including DHCP,
firewall, DNS, and NTP, along with a web interface for configuration.  This is
the <em>de facto</em> standard nowadays.</p>

<p>To use a car analogy, this is like building a custom car; you want to be
able to put in a new clutch, change the suspension, or try a new braking system
and see how it performs.  In the case of the gateway, you might want to
implement an outgoing port-based filter in addition to the incoming one in the
firewall. You may want to try a different DNS server or develop a special
module that will block MAC addresses through ACLs after exceeding a certain
amount of bandwidth in a short period of time.</p>

<p>For AWLP, the chassis is GNU/Linux Slackware, the engine is Host AP Driver,
the transmission is Host AP Utilities, and so on. AWLP code, written in Perl,
is the part that makes all these components work together in harmony as
a wireless access gateway. After you set up AWLP,
you will have a functioning, preconfigured, wireless access gateway to start
with.  Then you can start modifying the Perl code and configuration files to
test and implement the extra capabilities.</p>

<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

<p>You need a dedicated machine for this task. Running with less than 32 MB of
RAM will be painful; the system is more RAM-intensive than it is CPU-intensive
so you can run it even on a 486 processor--but be aware that most 486 machines
have only ISA slots.  You might have problems finding ISA 10/100 Mbps Ethernet
cards and ISA wireless LAN cards on the market. An old Pentium machine with at
least 1GB HDD is ideal for this task.</p>

<p>If you plan on running your wireless device on a 24/7 basis, and if
availability and portability are major concerns, you might consider dedicated
hardware. Check out <a href="http://www.openbrick.com/">OpenBrick Community</a>
for compact hardware platforms with HDD support.</p>

<p>In addition to the computer, you also need an Ethernet card compatible with
Linux, a PCI or PCMCIA wireless LAN card that has a Prism2/2.5/3 chipset, and a
PCI-to-PCMCIA converter, depending on your choice of wireless LAN card and the
slots on your board. Refer to the <a
href="http://awlp.sourceforge.net/hardwarecompatibility.html">AWLP Hardware
Compatibility</a> section for in-depth information on choosing these three
components. </p>

<h3>Installing AWLP</h3>

<p>There are three phases of installation:</p>

<ol>

<li>Custom installing Slackware with tagfiles</li>

<li>Upgrading packages in Slackware</li>

<li>Installing AWLP codes and configuration files</li>

</ol>

<p>The third step is the easiest one. The first step, installing Slackware with
tagfiles provided by the AWLP package, will take most of your time and effort. You
must have Slackware installation discs on hand. Consult the <a
href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware Linux Project</a> site to obtain
them. In order to keep this article readable, I again refer you to the related
site, the step-by-step <a
href="http://awlp.sourceforge.net/docs/installation.html">AWLP Installation
Instructions</a>. After completing the first and second phase of the
installation instructions, you can install AWLP, the code, and the configuration
files that will make everything work together.</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you take a disk image after successfully installing
AWLP and before you start to modify the code if you have installed it on a slow
machine. Installing AWLP code and configuration files take no more than couple
of minutes, but in order to reach this step, you must have custom-installed the
Slackware with the tagfiles provided, and this might take a couple of hours on an
old (&lt;200MHz) Pentium machine. Taking a disk image and restoring from that
image when needed will be a lot easier and quicker than starting afresh from
Step 1. </p>

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>AWLP uses several configuration files:</p>

<ul>
<li>DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: <em>/etc/dhcpd.conf</em></li>
<li>Apache Web Server: <em>/etc/apache/httpd.conf</em></li>

<li>DNS, the Domain Name System: <em>/etc/named.conf</em>,
<em>/var/named/caching-example/localhost.zone</em>,
<em>/var/named/caching-example/named.ca</em>, and
<em>/var/named/caching-example/named.local</em></li>

<li>NTP, the Network Time Protocol: <em>/etc/ntp.conf</em></li>
<li>Firewalling: <em>/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these standard configuration files, there are some custom
configuration files such as <em>/etc/awlp/oui_filtered.txt</em>.  This file
contains the filtered version of <em>oui.txt</em>, representing the <a
href="http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt">IEEE Organizationally
Unique Identifiers</a>. It makes it possible to find the company manufacturing
a specific Ethernet card, wired or wireless, using the first 24 bits of MAC
address. In order to have an in-depth knowledge of all the configuration files
and their layouts, I encourage you to examine <em>installer.sh</em> from the
AWLP package.</p>

<p>AWLP code resides in <em>/var/www/cgi-bin/awlp</em>. The core of the AWLP
code is <em>index.pl</em>. It does all of the error checking, manipulation, and
modification. The web server, Apache 1.3.33, runs as the user and group
<code>apache</code>. In order to manipulate configuration files through the web
browser, the related configuration files have suid and guid permissions set.
This strategy is definitely more secure than running the web server as
<code>root</code>.</p>

<p>The part that interacts with HostAP command line tools and utilities, along
with standard Linux tools and utilities, is <em>engines1.pl</em>. It serves as
an include file and contains various subroutines to do the work.
<em>engines2.pl</em> also contains various subroutines, but these usually 
do sorting, searching, and conversion. <em>radar.pl</em> provides status checking and monitoring functionality.
It's not crucial to the operating of the wireless access gateway, but it
definitely does add value because watching and monitoring how your device is
performing is the key factor to the success of your implementation.</p>

<p><em>extras.pl</em> provides ASCII to HEX conversion, DHCP lease table
display, and several other non-core functions. As the name implies,
<em>error_messages.pl</em> has all the error messages and their descriptions.
<em>global_configuration.pl</em> has pretty much all the configuration
variables ranging from critical to non-critical. You must understand the inner
workings of the system in order to change the configuration variables up to
<code>$MAIN_TITLE</code>. <code>$MAIN_TITLE</code> and the following variables
are also necessary, but for mostly cosmetic purposes, so you can customize them
without worrying about accidentally disabling needed features. </p>

<h3>Sample Modification</h3>

<p>Now you know what AWLP is and what it can do.  What about all these
modifications and customizations? Now, it is time to show you a step-by-step
instruction for adding a feature to AWLP. As of AWLP 1.0, you can configure the
DHCP server only by manually changing <em>/etc/dhcpd.conf</em>. The
feature I want to demonstrate will simply show the contents of the file. Once
you have familiarity with the code, you can improve it to modify the contents
of <em>dhcpd.conf</em>.</p>

<p>The Apache web server runs as the user and group <code>apache</code>. The
result of <code>ls -l</code> on <em>/etc/dhcpd.conf</em> shows:</p>

<pre><code><strong># ls -l /etc/dhcpd.conf</strong>
-rwxrwx---  1 root apache 618 Mar 5 12:41 /etc/dhcpd.conf*</code></pre>

<p>The script will be able to read and modify the <em>/etc/dhcpd.conf</em>
file. Open the <em>index.pl</em> file.  At the top, there are two configuration
variables; <code>@MainPageLinksAction</code> and
<code>@MainPageLinksName</code>. These two control the links on the left side.
To add an additional link for DHCP, add <code>DHCP</code> to both arrays.</p>

<p>Next, find the line that says:</p>

<pre><code>elsif ($FORM_Action1 eq &quot;Administration&quot;) {</code></pre>

<p>Just before this line, add the following lines of code, then save and close
the file.</p>

<pre><code>elsif ($FORM_Action1 eq &quot;DHCP&quot;) {

    my $DHCPConfigFileContent;

    if (open(FILE, &quot;/etc/dhcpd.conf&quot;)) {
        local $/;
        $DHCPConfigFileContent = &lt;FILE&gt;;
        close(FILE);
    }

    unless ($DHCPConfigFileContent) {
        $DHCPConfigFileContent = &quot;/etc/dhcpd.conf could not be read or it is empty!&quot;;
        $DHCPLeaseRangeStart = &quot;N/A&quot;;
        $DHCPLeaseRangeEnd   = &quot;N/A&quot;;
    }

    my ($DHCPLeaseRangeStart, $DHCPLeaseRangeEnd);

    if ($DHCPConfigFileContent =~ m/Range\s+(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\s+(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)/i) {
        $DHCPLeaseRangeStart = $1;
        $DHCPLeaseRangeEnd   = $2;
    }

    $Right_Plane_Output .=&lt;&lt;HTMLCODE
    &lt;TABLE ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=3 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
    &lt;TR BGCOLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;
            &lt;TD ALIGN=LEFT&gt;
            &lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica, Arial, Sans-serif, Verdena&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0&gt;
            &lt;TR&gt;
                    &lt;TD&gt;
                    &lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica, Arial, Sans-serif, Verdena&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;
                    ${DHCPConfigFileContent}
                    &lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;

                    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
                    &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;Lease Range:&lt;/font&gt; 
                    &lt;B&gt;${DHCPLeaseRangeStart} to ${DHCPLeaseRangeEnd}&lt;/B&gt;
                    &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
                    &lt;/TD&gt;
            &lt;/TR&gt;
            &lt;/TABLE&gt;
            &lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;
    &lt;/TABLE&gt;
HTMLCODE

}</code></pre>

<p>Once you do this modification, there will be a new menu section on the left
side with the name DHCP. Clicking the DHCP link on the left will show you the
contents of <em>/etc/dhcpd.conf</em> and Lease Range values, which come from
the contents of the file through a simple regular expression construct.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>You will have a functioning wireless access gateway once you install AWLP.
The above illustration proves how easy it is to add features to this
software-based wireless access gateway, provided that you are familiar with
Perl. However, to accomplish more useful modifications tailored to your needs,
you should examine <em>index.pl</em> and the other core, and include scripts
and configuration files.</p>

<h3>Driving Windows DNS Server</h3>

<p>If you happen to manage a DNS server running on Windows 2000 or Windows 2003
with more than just a couple of dozen resource records on it, you've probably
already hit the limits of the MMC DNS plugin, the Windows administrative GUI
for the DNS server implementation. Doing mass operations like creating 20 new
records at once, moving a bunch of A records from one zone to another, or just
searching for the next free IP in a reverse zone, can challenge your patience.
To change the name part of an A record, you have to delete the entire record and
re-create it from scratch using the new name.  You've probably thought to yourself,
"There MUST be another way to do this."  There is!</p>

<p>Silently, almost shyly, behind the scenes and without the usual bells and
whistles, Microsoft has arrived at the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/extracts/rule_list.html">power
of the command shell</a>. For the DNS services[1], the command line utility
<code>dnscmd</code> is available as part of the AdminPac for the server
operating systems. <code>dnscmd</code> is a very solid command line utility,
with lots of options and subcommands, that allows you to do almost every
possible operation on your DNS server. These include starting and stopping the
server, adding and deleting zones and resource records, and controlling a lot
of its behavior.</p>

<p>This article explores how to run <code>dnscmd</code> from Perl. In that
respect, it is a classic "Perl-as-a-driver" script, invoking
<code>dnscmd</code> with various options and working on its outputs.</p>

<h3>DNSCMD</h3>

<p>Invoke <code>dnscmd /?</code> to see a top-level list of available subcommands
and type <code>dnscmd /<code>subcommand</code> /?</code> for more specific help
for this subcommand. <code>dnscmd /?</code> shows that there is a subcommand
<code>RecordDelete</code>, and <code>dnscmd /recorddelete /?</code> (case not
significant) explains that you need a zone name (like "my.dom.ain"), a node name
within this zone (like "host1"), a record type (like "A"), and the data part of
the resource record to delete (like "10.20.40.5").</p>

<p>The first argument to <code>dnscmd</code>, if you actually want to do
something with it, is the name of the DNS server to use. A full working
command looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>dnscmd dnssrv.my.dom.ain /RecordDelete my.dom.ain host1 A 10.20.40.5</code></pre>

<p>This opens the very welcome opportunity to run <code>dnscmd</code>
remotely&#8212;from your workstation, for example&#8212;which frees you from the need to
log in to your DNS server.</p>

<h3><a href="/2005/03/24/examples/wdns.pl">WDNS.PL</a> (The Script)</h3>

<p>The script in the current version only handles A and PTR records.
There is no handling of CNAME records, for example. Within this limitation, it
is also very A record-oriented: you can add or delete A records, change the IP or name
of an A record, or move the A record to a different zone. It
keeps PTR records in sync with these changes, creating or deleting a
corresponding PTR record with its A record. This is mostly what you want.</p>

<p>The most important thing to understand with this script is the format and
the meaning of the input data it takes ("Show me your data ...")[2]. The
format is simple, just:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;name1&gt;      &lt;target1&gt;
    &lt;name2&gt;      ...
    ...          ...</code></pre>

<p>Separate <code>name</code> and <code>target</code> by whitespace. A name is a
relative or fully- qualified domain name. A target can be one of these:</p>

<ul>

<li>another domain name, meaning to rename to that name;</li>
<li>an IP, meaning to change to this IP;</li>
<li>nothing or undef, meaning to delete this name.</li>

</ul>

<p>This mirrors the basic functions of the script. To add some extra candy,
the target parameter has two other possibilities which have proven very useful
in my environment.  A target can also be:</p>

<ul>

<li>a C net, given as a triple of IP buckets (like "10.20.40");</li>
<li>a net segment identifier ("v1", "v2", and so on, in my example).</li>

</ul>

<p>In both cases, the script will give the name a free IP (if possible) from
either the C net or the net segment specified by its identifier.  I'll return
to this idea soon.</p>

<p>To pull all of the various possibilities together, here is a list of sample
input lines, each representing one of the mentioned possibilities for the
target:</p>

<pre><code>          pcthe                10.20.90.53     -- new ip
          pcthe.my.dom.ain     10.20.90.53     -- new ip full qualified
          pcthe                10.20.90        -- search free ip in range
          pcthe                @v8             -- search free ip in net segment v8
          pcthe                pcthe2          -- rename host
          pcthe                pcthe.oth.dom   -- rename host full qualified
          pcthe                                -- delete host (with -r option)</code></pre>

<p>Pass this data to the script through either an input file or STDIN[3].</p>

<h4><code>init()</code></h4>

<p>Now to the code. At startup, <code>wdns.pl</code> pulls in the list of primary
zones from the given DNS server, both forward (names as lookup keys) and
reverse (IPs as lookup keys) zones. This is handy, because it will use this
list again and again.</p>

<h4><code>mv_ip()</code></h4>

<p>The main worker routine is the sub <code>mv_ip</code>.  (Don't think too
much about the name; it's from the time when the only function of the script
was to change the IP of a given name). For any given name/target pair, it does
the following: First it tries to find a FQDN for the name.  If it finds a host
for the given name, it uses the FQDN as a basis to construct the name part of
the targeted record. If it cannot find a name, it assumes that it should
create an entirely new record. If the options permit (<code>-c</code>), it
constructs one.</p>

<p>Then it inspects the target. Depending on its type, the
program prepares to assign a new IP to the name, rename an existing A record
while retaining the IP, search for a free IP in a certain range, or just
delete existing records.  When everything settles, the actual changes take
place, using <code>dnscmd</code> to delete and add A and PTR records as
appropriate. (There is no <code>UpdateRecord</code> function in
<code>dnscmd</code>, so updating is in fact a combination of delete and
create). </p>

<p>That's it! The rest of the code is lower-level functions that help to
achieve this.</p>

<h4><code>create_*</code> and <code>delete_*</code></h4>

<p>The four subs <code>create_A</code>, <code>create_PTR</code>,
<code>delete_A</code>, and <code>delete_PTR</code> are wrapper functions
around the respective invocations of <code>dnscmd</code>.  An additional issue
of interest is that Windows DNS will delete a PTR record once you delete the
corresponding A record, so you don't have to do so explicitly.</p>

<h4><code>get_rev_zone()</code> and <code>get_fwd_zone()</code></h4>

<p>One of the major issues when manipulating DNS resource records is picking
the right zone to do the change in. If you have just one forward and one
reverse zone, this is simple.  However, if you are maintaining a lot of zones
with domains and nested subdomains, while other subdomains of the same parent
have their own zones, this might be tedious.</p>

<p><code>wdns.pl</code> can offload this task for you. The subs
<code>get_rev_zone</code> and <code>get_fwd_zone</code> use the initially
retrieved list of primary zones from your server. They take an IP or a fully
qualified domain name respectively, and split it into the node part and the
zone part. So the IP 10.20.40.5 might split into 10.20.40 and 5 (if the proper
zone of this IP is 40.20.10.in-addr.arpa) or 10 and 20.40.5 (if
10.in-addr.arpa happens to be the enclosing zone), depending on your zone
settings. The same applies for domain names.  Other routines use this
information to add or delete resource records in their appropriate zones.</p>

<h4>IP Lookup Functions</h4>

<p>There is a set of subs I called "IP lookup functions". They all help to
find a free IP in an appropriate range. Depending on the target specification,
they will search a certain C net or a whole net segment of unused address. This
searching breaks down to finding the appropriate zone, the appropriate node
("subdomain"), and then listing the already existing leaf nodes in this range.
Once it has the list of used nodes, it starts scanning for gaps or unused
nodes off the end of the list. </p>

<csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/996" template="b/article_sidebar.view">

<p>An additional feature of these routines is that they honor certain reservations in
the ranges, either through fixed directives ("leave the first 50 addresses
free at the beginning of each net segment") or through inspecting dedicated
TXT records on the DNS server that contain the <code>RESERVED</code> keyword.
(The actual format of these records is
<code>RESERVED:&lt;range-spec&gt;:&lt;free text&gt;</code>, where
<code>range-spec</code> is a colon-separated list of IPs or IP ranges. An
example is <code>RESERVED:1,3,5,10-20,34:IPs reserved for the VPN
switches</code>). This helps avoid re-using reserved IPs accidentally through
the automatic script, and also helps avoid messing things up when time is short.</p>

<p>In the case of these TXT records, I used <code>dnscmd</code> to retrieve
them, not <code>nslookup</code>, which would have been equally possible.</p>

<h3>A Word About the Net Segments</h3>

<p>If your IPs reside in a segmented network, which is likely to be the case
for most sites, make sure that your hosts have addresses for the segments to
which they attach.  For this script I have chosen a poor man's approach to
represent the segments just by the list of their respective C nets in the
script itself (see the hash <code>%netsegs</code> in the "Config section").
There might be a more clever way to do this. If you are going to run the
script in your environment, edit this hash to reflect your network
topology.</p>

<p>The <code>dns_lookup</code> sub looks up the current DNS entries. It runs
the extern command <code>nslookup</code> and parses its output. If you need
more sophisticated DNS lookups (and <code>nslookup</code>'s options just won't
do), you might want to resort to <code>dig</code> (which has a Windows
version) or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-DNS">Net::DNS</a> (which
runs on Windows in any case). This simple way of doing it was just enough for
my needs.</p>

<p><em>Perl programmers have a special reason for choosing <a
href="http://www.mandrakelinux.com/">Mandrakelinux</a> as their desktop
operating system. Mandrakelinux uses Perl for dozens of the graphical "value
added" utilities included with the distribution, including much of the
Mandrakelinux Control Center. I asked Mandrakelinux for an interview with a top
Perl contributor and they sent <a href="http://rgarciasuarez.free.fr/">Rafael
Garcia-Suarez</a> my way. Besides being heavily involved with Perl at
Mandrakesoft, Rafael is also the pumpking for the Perl 5.10 release. Rafael
answered my questions about using Perl for GUI programming and how he balances
his day job with being pumpking.</em></p>

<p><strong>O'Reilly Network:</strong> Briefly tell us about the Perl work you
do for Mandrakelinux.</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> My main responsibility is to maintain and enhance
the command-line tool urpmi (and its GUI counterpart rpmdrake), which are the
Mandrakelinux equivalent of Debian's apt or Fedora's yum; that is, fetching
RPMs and their dependencies and installing or upgrading them.</p>

<!-- sidebar begins -->
 <csperl file="grab" domain="on" record="b/1430" template="b/article_sidebar.view">
<!-- sidebar ends -->

<p>This job extends to whatever pertains to installing RPMs; that means that I
also participate in enhancing Mandrakelinux's installer. All those tools are
written in Perl.</p>

<p>Besides this, I also maintain the RPM of perl itself and of a load of CPAN
modules for Mandrakelinux.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> Perl is uncommon choice for graphical programming, yet
Mandrakelinux has used Perl for over 50 graphical applications. Many of these
tools are specific to Mandrakelinux, adding value to the distribution. What can
you tell us about why Mandrakelinux uses Perl for this important role?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> Not all tools were always written in Perl. However
using consistently a same language allows to share and reuse libraries across
all tools, be it the perl/rpmlib bindings or custom graphical toolboxes. Thus,
for example, the OS installer shares code with urpmi and rpmdrake. A scripting
language was preferred because of rapidity of development and ease of debug --
attempts at writing rpmdrake in C were painful, although that was before I was
hired by Mandrakesoft. Perl was a natural choice since there were already very
good in-house skills for it.</p>

<p><em>Editors note: Recently, the <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a> distributionexemplified the use of dynamic languages to bring a graphical application to market quickly.  Their <a href="http://info.linspire.com/lsongs/">Lsongs</a>  nd <a href="http://info.linspire.com/lphoto/">Lphoto</a> programs use Python.</em></p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> Could you give a specific example of where Perl has
made a noticeable difference in shortening development time?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> I think that using a scripting language in general
shortens the development time, notably due to the shorter write code / compile
/ test / debug cycle. However perl is particularly useful due to the high
number of development modules available on CPAN. For example running the OS
installer under <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Trace">Devel::Trace</a> produces
lots of logs, but is tremendously helpful to trace obscure bugs. You can't do
this in C without adding <code>printf</code>s everywhere and recompiling the
whole stuff.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> What tools does Mandrakelinux use for automated
testing of graphical Perl applications?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> Er, interns ?</p>

<p>More seriously, there is no automated testing for GUIs.  Automated testing
of such applications raises several difficult problems, since they often modify
a system's configuration or necessitate some specific hardware (and I'm not
even speaking of the OS installer GUI).</p>

<p>Writing more unit tests is definitively something I want to do in the
future, however; it would be very useful to have complete sets of regression
tests for the urpmi dependency solver, for example.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> What has been the response of the Perl community to
Mandrakelinux Perl-based tools, especially in terms of contributing patches
back to your organization?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> The people who send patches for the tools are
mostly interested in improving the distribution they use; even if they might
belong to the Perl community as well, their point of view is the one of a
Mandrakelinux user. That's one of the reasons why the tools have little
visibility outside the MDK community.</p>

<p>Another reason is that there never was a strong motivation in Mandrakesoft
for splitting the libraries in what is and is not MDK-specific, and to write
clear and comprehensive documentation: both need efforts, don't pay immediately
and are likely to be postponed when you have deadlines.</p>

<p>However, the CVS repository in which the tools' source code is kept is
openly accessible; some contributors (i.e. non Mandrakesoft employees) have
been granted commit access to it. We now need to make the learning curve
softer.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong>What advice do have for Perl programmers interested in
contributing to the Perl-based Mandrakelinux utilities? Any helpful hints for
getting started?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> As with any open-source project, if you want to
learn how it's done and to contribute, use the latest version available. In the
case of Mandrakelinux, that would be "cooker", the development distribution.
Subscribe to the mailing list, become familiar with the tools, have a checkout
from the CVS repository, get yourself a Bugzilla account and don't be afraid to
ask questions. Learning to build RPMs, at least to be able to rebuild the RPMs
of the tools, would be helpful too. Those questions are covered in the wiki; a
good page to begin with is:</p>

<blockquote><a
href="http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HowTo">http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/HowTo</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> What challenges have you faced maintaining Perl as a
core part of the operating system, with so many key utilities depending on
it?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> There are two kinds of challenges: spatial and
temporal, would I say.</p>

<p>First, spatially, you have to devise how to split the standard Perl
distribution on smaller packages ("perl-base" for the essentials, "perl" for
the rest of modules, "perl-devel" for Perl development tools and "perl-doc"
for, well, perldoc itself and the standard documentation.) This split is not
arbitrary. When you maintain a core tool like urpmi, which is essential to
system administration, you don't want it to require too many Perl modules, or
even too many core modules. (The same goes for the installer, that must not
take all the space on the installation CDs). So perl-base contains the modules
used by urpmi, and urpmi doesn't use modules that are in perl but not in
perl-base.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> Perl has a reputation for being "slow" when used for
graphical programming. How is that addressed in Mandrakelinux applications?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> I think that Perl doesn't deserve this reputation,
only some Perl programs do ! The MDK tools use the perl-Gtk2 bindings (mostly
for historical reasons, the Qt bindings weren't mature enough when the
development of those tools started); and since they're pretty close to the C
lib, performance is very acceptable.</p>

<p>Did you know that the game <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">Frozen
Bubble</a>, written by a former Mandrakesoft employee, is implemented in Perl ?
It's not anywhere near slow. Actually people are often surprised to learn that
Frozen Bubble or the MDK tools are written in Perl, since they don't give the
impression of slowness generally associated to scripted GUIs.</p>

<p>In fact, it appears that the speed bottlenecks of the MDK tools are, like in
other programs, data processing, not display.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> You've recently become the pumpking for Perl 5.10. How
does your this interact with your day job and how do you balance the two
positions?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> I was deeply involved in the development of Perl 5
before that, taking time to review and apply patches and so on. So I was mostly
working on it on evenings and week-ends. I can now work on Perl 5 during my
dayjob, since Mandrakesoft allows its developers to work on free projects they
like part time. However, I'd point out that my day job is a bit special, since,
contrary to proprietary projects, I'm always in contact with its community of
users, via mail, IRC or other internet-based media (and even sometimes in real
life.) Thus I'm sometimes led to work during my free time as well... In other
words the frontier between day job and other open source development is
blurred. In both cases things have to be done. The only difference is that for
the day job thing, I have deadlines, and they pay me for it.</p>

<p><strong>ORN:</strong> Do you have a favorite Perl module that more people
should know about?</p>

<p><strong>Rafael:</strong> I don't really know, I learn new modules mostly by
hanging around in places where the cool kids discover them before me -- mailing
lists, mongers, <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a>. I use <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?B::Concise">B::Concise</a> all the time,
but I suspect it's not useful for people who are not familiar with the
internals of perl. Also, recently, I found <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?encoding::warnings">encoding::warnings</a>
useful for debugging Unicode-related bugs.</p>
