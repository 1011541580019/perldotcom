<br />
<br />
<P>Can a tech conference on a luxury cruise boat possibly be legitimate?
Sure it is, and then some.</P>

<P>This past Memorial Day, I joined about 200 attendees on Perl Whirl
2000, the inaugural Geek Cruise.  All in all, we found that not
only was there a mind-blowingly good set of tutorials available,
but there was more time to meet and chat with fellow Perl hackers
than there is at most conferences.</P>

<P>Honestly, I knew I was going on the Perl Whirl, but the idea
took a while to set in.  When I received my tickets, it still
seemed unreal.  When I started packing my bags, it seemed like
just another conference.  When I boarded the plane, it was just
another trip.  When I arrived at my hotel in Vancouver, reality
began to set in: I'm going on a Cruise.  To Alaska.  Talking
about Perl all along the way.  Soon, we would board Holland America's
m.s. Volendam and kick off Perl Whirl 2000.</P>

<P>From the very beginning, the cruise exuded a palpable air of calm.
Gone was the normal harried conference mentality where every minute
is either spent agonizing over which great presentation to attend
or which great conversation to continue in the hall.  From the
moment we left the harbor, everyone had a laid-back attitude, as
if to say ``I can find you later, we have a week together and plenty
of time to talk''.  And that made all the difference.</P>

<P>Anyone who thought this wasn't a serious conference was in for a
big surprise.  Although there were many social events, sometimes
starting at 10 or 11 PM, the tutorials started at 8:30am and continued
until 5 PM.  (The schedule was just packed, and I'm not the only
one who was hurting around 8am, especially when we had to adjust
our clocks into and out of Alaska Time.)  Three full days of tutorials
were offered across three to five tracks, with the middle day being
split into two half-day chunks.  Ten extra hours of conference
programming were available in roughly ninety-minute chunks before
dinner on some nights.  Then there was the B-Movie marathon.  Then there
were the cocktail parties.  Then there were all of the other 
events organized by the ship's cruise director.  Yes, the schedule
was truly packed.</P>

<P>Even with such a dense schedule, there was plenty of time to
unwind.  We could all eat a nice long, lingering dinner in the main
dining room (or take dinner on the Lido deck in shorts and T-shirts,
or just order room service), and gradually reconvene in the Crow's
Nest after dinner for a few drinks (or not), and lots of after-dinner
conversation until the dusk finally gave way to pre-dawn twilight
around 3am.</P>

<P>What were the seminars themselves like?  Some of the presenters
were incredibly popular, like Mark-Jason Dominus, Tom Christiansen,
Tim Bray and Lincoln Stein.  The bits and pieces I sat through were
simply stellar, without exception.  Many people I talked to echoed
the common conference complaint, ``there's too much good stuff to
see, and too many great presentations conflict with each other''.  
Sadly, every conference organizer heard this before, and such
conflicts are bound to appear as soon as a schedule is produced.</P>

<P>While I didn't sit through most of the seminar program, I did sit
through the entire pre-dinner program.  Here attendees got to hear
some great things people are doing with Perl.  The first pre-dinner
talk was by Steven Roberts who talked about his Microship project.
Some people may remember Steve as the man behind Behemoth, the
recumbent bicycle and trailer with more computing power than an
average dentist's office.  Steve's current project is a pair of
boats with similar amounts of computing power that will soon travel
the inland and coastal waters of the United States.  Steve's team
recently realized that projects such as this live and die on
volunteer effort, and while it is quite easy to find Perl hackers
to write and upgrade Perl CGI programs, it is quite difficult to
find  NewtonScript programmers willing to donate their time to a
project like this.  This observation drove Steve and his team to
replace a Newton-based management console with a simple web browser
running against an on-board linux-based web server.</P>

<P>Steve's talk went over incredibly well, and I was among a small
group of people on the boat who couldn't stop talking about it all
week.  The enthusiasm behind this ninety minute presentation was so much
more than expected that it helped everyone involved with GeekCruises
realize that we never set aside any time for BOFs (``birds of a
feather'' sessions).  Once again, the unharried, laid-back atmosphere
came back to help us, and we found a block of time that didn't
conflict with any other programming and just met beside the pool
(conveniently placed near a totally unhealthy amount of dessert).</P>

<P>Two nights later, we were privileged to hear John Clutterbuck
discuss how Perl saved the Land Registry System in Scotland,
displacing Java, cross-platform toolkits and 4GL environments in
the process.  The crux of John's talk was about implementing a
typical n-tier client-server system.  Instead of using a more
``traditional'' tool like Java, Visual Basic or other such
environments, John's team used Perl/TK to create graphical client
programs.  One of the major reasons why Perl was a good choice for
this project was that Perl was already in use internally to munge
incoming data feeds.  When it was time to implement this project,
Perl/TK was not another new skill requiring downtime and retraining;
it was just another library to use alongside the DBI.</P>

<P>There were other great non-seminar presentations.  Tim Bray talked
about standards, standards organizations, and encouraged everyone
to complain loudly when our vendors don't implement standards that
matter to us, implement them poorly, or misimplement them
intentionally.  The next night, Larry Wall guest-hosted Jon Orwant's
Internet Quiz show, which was quite fun.  The cruise program wound up
about a day later, when Larry was available for an open-ended question
and answer session.  This Q&amp;A was quite refreshing, because the
questions were frequently deep, often thought-provoking, and always
brought out an honest, uncensored answer from Larry (unless his 
wife Gloria pre-empted him).</P>

<P>Oh, did I mention that this was a cruise?  With all these Perl-ish
events all week, it was easy to forget at times that we were in the
midst of some of the most beautiful parts of North America.  While we
were cruising north, we witnessed an endless parade of tree-lined
mountains of British Columbia and Alaska.  Our itinerary also brought
us into Glacier Bay, where we saw the big ice break apart in the morning
and watched for whales in the afternoon.</P>

<P>And what's the point of cruising to Alaska if you're not going to
get off the boat and actually see Alaska?  Our itinerary offered
three ports of call.   Our first port was Juneau, the largest city
in southeast Alaska.  Although Juneau may be too small to have a
Kinko's, it is plenty large enough to have one of the finest
breweries in North America.  Around forty Perl Whirl passengers
gathered together to go on a Pub Crawl over Juneau while we were
docked.  Our first stop was the Alaska Brewing Company, voted best
brewery in America three years running at the Great American Beer
Festival (they are now enshrined in the GABF's ``Hall of Foam'').
After leaving the brewery, we visited some other local watering
holes and passed by the wondrous Mendenhall Glacier.  Our crawl
ended up near the dock at the Mt. Roberts tram.  At the top of Mt.
Roberts, we found ourselves in bright sunlight at 9 PM on the last
day in May, making snowballs behind the observation deck.  When
life gives you a chance to make snowballs in Alaska when it's warm
enough to wear shorts and sandals, it's best to take advantage 
of the opportunity.</P>

<P>The next day, we found ourselves in Skagway, a small town north of
Juneau where the main industry is obviously tourism.  The helicopter
pad at the end of the dock says so loud and clear.  At this point
in our travels, I must admit that I welcomed a quiet day wandering
through this small town, perhaps reading a bit of the Cryptonomicon
on a sunny patch of turf.  After a quick stroll, I bumped into Tom
Christiansen, who asked me if I was up for a little walk.  I
briefly forgot that Tom lives in Boulder, Colorado; when he says
``little walk'', most other people interpret that as ``a hike in the
woods''.  I joined Tom, and we had a wonderful afternoon wandering
through a lush green trail that started at the edge of Skagway.
When we reached our destination, we were surrounded by on all sides
by the largest fjord in North America.  All in all, it was the most
enjoyable day I spent on the cruise.</P>

<P>After our wanderings through Glacier Bay, we wound up in Ketchikan,
our last port of call.  I decided it was time wander aimlessly with
my friends Monty and Julie Taylor.  Julie peeled off early that
morning and would later catch a 34-inch salmon on a fishing excursion.
Monty and I were up for some local flavor and eventually found
Anabelle's, a great little restaurant that serves a stunningly good
seafood chowder and beer-battered halibut and chips.  Paired with a
fresh pint or two of Alaskan Amber, and this is easily the best meal
I had all week, and the chefs on board the Volendam provided some
stiff competition.  If I ever return to Ketchikan, you can find me at
Anabelle's.</P>

<P>Speaking of excursions, I didn't sign up for any mountain bike
rides, helicopter rides, sea-plane tours, hikes or fishing.  Lots
of people did, but I'm a city boy who likes meandering through
town, and the occasional hike in the woods.  And I had a great time
doing just that.</P>

<P>All in all, I had a wonderful time on Perl Whirl 2000.  The Perl
was great and Alaska was too (or maybe the other way around).  Will
I return to Alaska again?  Perhaps.  Will I return to Alaska on a
future Perl Whirl?  Just try and stop me.</P>

<!-- Editor's Notes -->

<ul>

<li>If you haven't seen it already, you might want to check out
<a
href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2000/06/06/geekcruise.html">the
31 things Tim Bray learned on the cruise</a>.  It has pictures,
including one of Larry in one of his many tuxedos.

<li>It turns out to be surprisingly easy to keep up an 8 AM - 11 PM
schedule when the sun doesn't start setting until 9 PM and then comes
up again at 3 AM.  

<li>I can attest to the laid-back attitude on the cruise.  Everyone I
met was kind and friendly, which isn't always the case at shorter
conferences in less delightful venues.  

<li>In Glacier Bay, if you were quiet, you could hear the glacier
creaking and popping as it slid into the sea.  I had heard stories of
glaciers calving, which is when a piece breaks off and falls into the
water.  (This is where icebergs come from.)  I had always imagined
that this was a comparatively rare event, that if you watched the
glacier every moment for a whole day, you might, if you were lucky,
see a piece break off.  Wrong!  Stuff is breaking off the glacier all
the time and you only have to watch for a few minutes before something
happens.  

<li>Downsides of the cruise ship: Sometimes other cruise activities
interfered with the conference.  For example, Dori Smith's Javascript
class was held in a small room just off the main dining room, where a
wine-tasting session was in progress, and it was hard to hear Dori
over the amplified voice of the wine expert.  Similarly, one of my
classes was in the room immediately adjacent to the
casino---fortunately there was a door I could use to shut out the slot
machine racket.

<li>My favorite cruise story: I got to interrupt my regex class so that we
could rush over to the windows and look at the whales off the side of
the ship.

<li>Finally:  Adam says it was easy to forget  that we were in the
midst of some of the most beautiful parts of North America.  It wasn't
easy for me to forget, and I spent most of my free time just staring
out of various windows.
