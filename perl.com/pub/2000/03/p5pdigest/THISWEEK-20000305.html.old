Well, my apologies to everyone for the long absence.  I'm going to try
to send out reports more frequently, and to let go some of my
obsession about being completely complete, and see if I can stay on
schedule.
</P>

<P>
This means that if you think I missed something of importance, I would
be more grateful than ever if you would bring it to my attention.

Since last time, Perl has had three beta releases and now stands at
version 5.5.670.

<p>
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-03/msg00082.html">Announcement for version 5.5.670</a></P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-02/msg01319.html">Announcement for version 5.5.660</a></P>

<P>
In the wake of this, list traffic is very high with various small bug
reports and configuration problems.
<H3><a name="Module_Warnings">Module Warnings</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Paul Marquess added functionality to the 
<CODE>warnings.pm</CODE> lexical warnings module so that a module could peek at the warnings
 that are enabled in its caller, and issue similar sorts of warnings.
For example, your function might issue a warning about a newline at
the end of its filename argument, but only if your function's caller has the 
<CODE>newline</CODE> category of warnings enabled.
</P>

<P>
Paul asked whether it would be a good idea to allow modules to be able
to register their own warning categories, and presented a possible
interface to such functionality.  Then you might say something like
</P>

</P><PRE>
        use Fred;
        use warnings 'Fred';
</PRE>

<P>
to turn on the warnings that were special to the 
<CODE>Fred</CODE> module.  Paul asked for comments from the list about this.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-03/msg00440.html">Original message</a></P>

<P>

There was a lot of interesting discussion of this.  Paul said that he
had thought 
about making it possible for a module to define its own
<I>hierarchy</I> of warnings, but that that seemed like overkill.  Ron Kimball
suggested that 
<CODE>use warnings 'Fred'</CODE> or 
<CODE>no warnings 'Fred'</CODE> might enable or disable warnings from module 
<CODE>Fred</CODE> regardless of whether or not 
<CODE>Fred</CODE> had registed its own warning category.  Paul said he had considered
 this, but that it would suggest to people that doing 
<CODE>use warnings 'Some::Module'</CODE> would necessarily do something useful, when in fact 
<CODE>Some::Module</CODE> might not issue any warnings at all.
</P>

<P>
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes pointed out that if module names are
warning categories, then you could put explanations of your warnings
into your module's POD and then 
<CODE>diagnostics</CODE> would be able to find the explanations or your own module's warnings.
<H3><a name="POD_Changes">POD Changes</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

5.5.670 brought with it some changes to the structure of POD.  In
particular, the old problem of putting angle brackets into 
<CODE>C<...></CODE> tags
is probably solved.  You can now write 
<CODE>C<< $var->method >></CODE> and the rule
is that the text to be output is delimited by the double-angle
brackets <I>and</I> whitespace.</P>

<P>
Changes went into 
<CODE>Pod::Man</CODE>, 
<CODE>Pod::Parser</CODE> and 
<CODE>Pod::HTML</CODE> to support this.  Robin Barker pointed out that 
<CODE>pod2latex</CODE> still did not support this and other changes, and rather than dig
 into the horrible squiggly guts of 
<CODE>pod2latex</CODE> to fix it, he wrote a preprocessor (using 
<CODE>Pod::Parser</CODE> which removes the new escape codes
from a pod document and yields an old-style POD.  He bolted this to
the front of 
<CODE>pod2latex</CODE>, which in my opinion was the right thing to do.  Way to cut that
gordian knot, dude.
<H3><a name="Race_conditions_in_statndard_Perl_utilities">Race conditions in statndard Perl utilities</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Tom Christiansen posted a `Request for Hero' to fix the parts of the
Perl distribution that write files to 
<CODE>/tmp</CODE> in an unsafe way, laying themselves open to race condition exploits
and soforth.  A typical problem is that 
<CODE>/tmp</CODE> is world-writable, so a malicious person could remove the temporary
 file and replace it with a new one before the program notices.  
Worse, if the superuser is running the program, a malicious user might
remove the temporary file and replace it with a symbolic link to the
password file; when the program updates what it thinks is the
temporary file, it is really updating the password file.
</P>

<P>
Tom
listed several utilities that may have these problems, including 
<CODE>perlcc</CODE>, 
<CODE>perldoc</CODE>, 
<CODE>perlbug</CODE>, and 
<CODE>s2p</CODE> although he also said that none of these bugs were actually in the core.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-03/msg00498.html">Read about it.</a></P>

<P>

Tom called for a core 
<CODE>File::Temp</CODE> module that would encapsulate safe temporary file creation functions.
</P>

<P>
Tim Jenness said that he had written such a thing about a year ago, and
he volunteered to be the hero.  Discussion of various
attacks via
<CODE>/tmp</CODE> ensued. 
<H3><a name="open_Calls_not_checked_in_perldoc"><code>open</code> Calls not checked in <code>perldoc</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Tom posted a related note, showing about half a dozen places in 
<CODE>perldoc</CODE> where a system call, usually 
<CODE>open</CODE>, was performed with no check of the return code. 
<H3><a name="Big_Flame_Wars">Big Flame Wars</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Somehow the `
<CODE>open</CODE> calls' discussion turned into a gigantic flame war. 
</P>

<P>
If it's not too late, I advise skipping it.  The subject is 
`security (and stupidity) bugs in perldoc'.
<H3><a name="Chip_and_Jarkko_Quit">Chip and Jarkko Quit</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Chip Salzenberg and Jarkko Hietaniemi quit p5p, citing big flame wars
as the reasons.  Chip created a new mailing list, which is supposed to
be just like p5p, except that ``verbal abuse will not be tolerated.''
</P>

<P>
Leaving aside any questions of how Chip plans to enforce this, I
believe that forking p5p is an incredibly bad idea.  I can only hope
that the new list will turn out to be irrelevant, but I'm really
afraid that it will draw off just enough of the productive people from
the main list to prevent both groups from being effective.
</P>

<P>
I'd love to revisit this in a year and find out that I'm wrong.  
<H3><a name="Templates_in_pack_and_unpack">Templates in <code>pack</code> and <code>unpack</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Way back in October, Ilya had an idea for making 
<CODE>pack</CODE> and 
<CODE>unpack</CODE> capable of automatically unpacking data in any format, even one that
 was not known in advance.  I wrote this up in October, but Ilya's new
 messages now suggest that I didn't understand the point.
Ilya says:
<blockquote><b>Ilya:</b> There were some initial objections due tomisunderstanding of the posted example: people thought that theexamples of serialization I initially posted for illustrationwere the <b>only</b> ways to serialize data.  </blockquote></P>

<P>

<P>
is probably worth reading, but skip the rest of the thread.  It was a
waste of time even before the tail end of this thread was
sucked into the
flame zone.
</P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/1999/10/p5pdigest/THISWEEK-19991031.html#pack_t_Template">(Old news here)</a><H3><a name="use_strict_in_the_core_modules"><code>use strict</code> in the core modules</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Peter Scott asked why 84/109 core modules did not use 
<CODE>strict</CODE>.   That is a good question, and I don't think the answer is going to
turn out to be `carelessness and hystorical accident'.  At least, not
in every case.
</P>

<P>
If someone <i>did</i> go around putting 
<CODE>use strict</CODE> into all the core modules, I think it would be a real good idea if
they also kept track of how many <I>actual</I> bugs they found andcorrected as a result, and how many non-bugs.

A large collection of bug reports, bug fixes, non-bug reports,
questions, and answers.    Also spam.
