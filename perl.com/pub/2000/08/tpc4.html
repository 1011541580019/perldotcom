<P>Were do I begin? Like Willy Wonka said, "..the beginning is a very
good place to start..." So let's start with my journey to the
conference.</P>

<P><BR></P>

<P>Day 0: July 15, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>My flight to San Jose wasn't delayed too long. During my wait I did
get to down some Sam Adams and Jack Daniels while reading <u>Java and
XML</u>. Yeah, I know it's probably blasphemous to read a Java book on
the way to TPC, but I was looking for some good ideas on using
XML, and it is an O'Reilly book.</P>

<P>In any case, I had a thankfully uneventful flight (way too many
babies on board, but they remained quiet the entire trip). Picking up
the
rental car and driving to Monterey wasn't too bad other than occurring
after midnight.</P>

<P><BR></P>

<P>Day 1: July 16, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>This was an enjoyable day of wandering about Monterey. I mostly
walked around the northern marina, watching the ocean and walking
enjoying the sand and surf. It was a pleasant day just seeing
restaurants, pubs, and other businesses I didn't suspect even existed
(like the movie theatres near the hotels).</P>

<P>In the early afternoon I picked up a buddy at the Monterey Airport,
feeding his Jack in the Box addiction, and registering for the
conference.</P>

<P>Monterey is really a lovely place to visit on the company dime.</P>


<P><BR></P>

<P>Day 2: July 17, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>Well, this is the first day of tutorials. I am scheduled to attend
both of Damian Conway's Parse::RecDescent classes. It was something I
looked forward to, these were the tutorials I really wanted to
attend.</P>

<P>After a quick breakfast, I dashed off to "Practical Parsing with
Parse::RecDescent". It was such a delight to attend the lecture. 
Damian was funny, witty, and ably conveyed the basic principles and
concepts of parsing and lexing (something I had very vague notions
about prior to this tutorial). I had been reading the ample
documentation that accompanies the module in the months prior to the
conference. I had started to grasp the material, but I hadn't the time
to fully grok and apply it. This class brought everything into sharp
focus.</P> 

<P>There were a few things that really stuck with me:
  <OL>
    <LI>"Parsing with Occam's Razor". The idea to make your grammar as
simple as needed. This along with his C parsing examples gave me some
good ideas on how to do some qualitative analysis and verification of
code.</LI>
    <LI>"Any sufficiently advanced syntax is indistinguishable from
semantics." Any interesting twist on what I believe is an Arthur C.
Clarke quote. This was an opening remark Damian made leading into the
section where he created a grammar to parse natural language queries
into SQL statements.</LI>
  </OL>
</P>

<P>The afternoon class was icing on the cake and an iron maiden for
the mind. "Advanced Parsing with Parse::RecDescent" was as inspiring
as it was frightening. Creating self modifying grammars on-the-fly is
a mind melting concept, let alone to see an actual implementation of
it. Two examples that stuck out were:

<OL>
  <LI>A parser that is created on the fly to parse Apache config files
so that it can create another parser for the error log.</LI>
  <LI>A parser written in pure Perl that can "(nearly) parse Perl".
Very frightening how close Damian is to doing this.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>Damian is probably the First Virtue incarnate. Anything that might
save some work, reduce redundancy, or in general minimize effort for
maximum effect was attempted by Dr. Conway. Truly amazing.
Additionally, I think I have stumbled upon a new form of software,
"Christmas-ware". I leave it as an incentive for the reader to attend
one of Damian's talks to truly understand this new paradigm in
software development. ;-)</P>

<P>Unfortunately the tutorial went long, as Damian is infamous for,
because I had a dinner reservation at the Sardine Factory. If you're
ever in Monterey don't hesitate to have dinner there. You won't be
disappointed. For example, I had a very reasonably priced 5-course
dinner.

<UL>
<LI> Appetizer: Blanched green beans in a vinaigrette</LI>
<LI> Soup: Albacore bisque, probably the best soup I've ever had</LI>
<LI> Salad: Huge chunk of iceberg lettuce with a Maytag blue cheese and
balsamic vinaigrette.</LI>
<LI> Entree: Beef Tenderloin on a bed of spinach and grilled slice of
onion, with Southwestern-style shrimp. Can't exactly recall the sauce,
but it was beef based and spicy</LI>
<LI> Dessert: Creme Brulee, very good</LI>
</UL>

</P>

<P>The grand finale of the evening however was the double feature,
<U>Office Space</U> and <U>Evil Dead II</U>. A pleasant finish to the
day. A
little Dilbertian office satire and the genius of Sam Raimi. On the
big
screen no less.</P>

<P><BR></P>

<P>Day 3: July 18, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>I had such high hopes for this day of tutorials. Some rather
interesting and potentially useful topics. Unfortunately, they proved
otherwise. Both were taught by capable and knowledgeable folks,
however they both had flaws.<P>

<P>The morning tutorial was "Exploiting Perl on Windows with OLE/COM".
It started off with 45 minutes of definitions and such. Not one line
of code to be seen. I could deal with some cursory examination of what
certain acronyms meant. That's why I have a workbook of the
presentation that I can refer to when I don't understand a term. To be
fair to David Roth, he was very knowledgeable about Perl and its use
on Windows systems. He also has provided invaluable work by
contributing many modules. However, I have come to expect a lot of
examples and code. "Show me the code", so to speak.</P>

<P>I bailed on that and caught some of the "Object Oriented Perl"
tutorial. Talking to my buddy that was attending the tutorial, it was
mostly going over similar topics discussed in Damian Conway's
<U>Object Oriented Perl</U> book. This wasn't much of a surprise since
Damian was the lecturer. :-)</P>

<P>After the break for the morning sessions I checked out Mark-Jason
Dominus' "Tricks of the Wizards" class. I had taken it last year and
just wanted to see if anything might have been added. After a few
minutes it looked that it hadn't, why change a good lecture? So I
decided to relax a bit and wait for lunch.</P>

<P>After lunch I had high hopes for the afternoon. Like I said, it was
a bad day. The tutorial, "XML Hacking with Perl and <code>XML::Parser</code>", was
excellent, but it was more of an intro course. The first hour passed
by without much new knowledge being transferred. I was hoping more for
application of the module and some good ideas of how to use XML in
general. Consequently, I strolled on over to Dominus' "Advanced
Programming Techniques" class. I particularly enjoyed the bit about
infinite lists and their implementation in things like: network client
requests and numeric approximations. Very useful stuff.</P>

<P>I recalled that O'Reilly was going to sell off any leftover
tutorial workbooks. During a section that was in "...Wizards" but was
moved to "...Techniques" I went and purchased some of the workbooks.
It was nice to get some feedback from the O'Reilly folks handling the
sell-off, mostly what they've heard other attendees had to say about
the class and the workbooks in particular. This feedback along with
getting to thumb through the text I was able to avoid some duds.</P>

<P>Once the tutorials were over for the day I took my buddy to the
airport so he could go catch the Comic Convention in San Diego. The
lucky bastard was be able to get some of the inside dirt on the
upcoming <U>Lord of the Rings</U> movies.</P>

<P>I made it to the Perl Trainers BOFs. The first one was most just
Perl Trainers trading war stories, tips, and general training
strategies.  For example, the sequence of topics, the difficulties
most newbies have understanding hashes, and how to approach the idea
of context.  One good story was the experience one trainer had when he
was teaching Perl to a bunch of COBOL programmers. IIRC, they had a
bit of trouble with file handles, but quickly understood regular
expressions when explained within the context of COBOL principles they
understood. I guess that just highlights the need to understand your
audience and how to take advantage of their pre-existing programming
knowledge. It was very interesting and informative since I want to do
some Perl training within my own company.</P>

<P>After that BOF there was Nathan Torkington's BOF for teaching Perl
to beginners, specifically those that have never programmed before. It
was more of the same, but delved more into how to teach Perl. One
technique that I liked best was to have the students start using the
code as quickly as possible. Also, using examples that are relevant to
their needs, once again "know your audience", or something that is
"cool".</P>

<P>Good Perl books for beginners were discussed. While "Llama" is the
de facto standard, it is not always appropriate. Andrew Johnson's
<U>Elements of Programming with Perl</U>, was mentioned a lot. This is
a really good book for the complete programming newbie, not just Perl
newbie. Clinton Pierce's <U>Learn Perl in 24 Hours</U> was mentioned a
few times. Simon Cozen's <U>Beginning Perl</U> was brought up but it
was new enough that not many had read it to give it a good review.
All in all these BOFs were a good time.</P>

<P>Then it was off to dinner and the Sendmail bash. That was very fun,
I got to mingle with some very cool Open Source and Perl folks. I
mostly chatted with some guys from HP and a dude from "USA Today". The
HP guys mainly dealt with load balancing and performance issues, they
also drank a lot of stout with me that night. The guy from "USA Today"
was responsible for reformatting news feeds and sending them off to
the various departments for publication. I sincerely wish I could
remember their names, but it was a long, drunk night and I met so
many great folks.</P>

<P>Of course, all of the free beer was great. It was a great end to an
otherwise disappointing day.</P>

<P><BR></P>

<P>Day 4: July 19, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>An early, but rough morning preceded the opening keynote speech.
Drinking until 2 am will sort of do that to you ;-)</P>

<P>Andy Hertzfelds' speech was wonderful. Much better than Guy
Kawasaki's
or Bill Joy's from last year. It was full of hope, history, and humor.
Everything you would expect from one of the original Apple
hackers.</P>

<P>The speech I came for was of course Larry Wall's. Once again he had
an
entertaining speech concerned with the complexities of systems; music
being the system he explored in breadth. From the simple instruments
(fingers and hands) to percussion (bongo drums, spoons, and claves),to
strumming a bass, acoustic guitar, violin/fiddle, autoharp, bowing a
saw, and a synthesizer just to name a few.


<P>Larry then saved the biggest sound for last, the announcement of a
total rewrite of Perl. Something that was well received by all.</P>

<P>After the State of the Onion, I proceeded to catch a couple of
channels of Damian TV. Most notably his papers presenting a
switch/case statement for Perl and the yet-to-be-released module
<code>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</code>. Perligata was a great
presentation. Damian took advantage of the inflected nature of Latin,
word order in a sentence doesn't matter because the form of the word
determines if it is a noun, verb, object, etc. By judicious and
ingenious selection of the various forms, Dr. Conway created a module
that allows you to write perl programs in Latin! Definitely get a hold
of this module/paper and read it.</P>

<P>In between Dr. Conway's talks, I caught a bit of Kevin Lenzo's
"Field of Memes", a very interesting look at the IRC bot, purl. It was
interesting looking at a system that is somewhere between AI, expert
system, and knowledge base. It reminded me of how I think an
agent/diva would/should work but much simpler. Basically, you asked
purl a question and purl answered it the best it could.</P>

<P>As for the afternoon talks, they were good but not very
memorable.</P>

<P>Then it was off to the Caribbean Bash, the free food and booze
party
for all of the conference attendees. Once again, it was fun to mingle
with
folks.</P>

<P>After the bash was a BOF put on by Dominus, "Something Cool Dominus
is
working on". At the BOF we got to find out how pathetic his phone
company was
at doing DSL. This was a fun rant to listen to, but it meant he
couldn't demo
some of the cool stuff he has prototyped and he couldn't look at his
special
projects file. Nonetheless, he talked about the work he started for
the creation of a regex debugger. He created a working prototype and
had the engineer working. Very cool. If I was a better C programmer I
would have probably picked up where he left off and played with it. It
does have me thinking about how to implement one in pure Perl.</P>

<P>He briefly touched upon his documentation idea, basically how to
create an extensible and adaptable manual. Unfortunately, we were
kicked out of the room before he could get into it.</P>

<P><BR></P>

<P>Day 5: July 20, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>Tim O'Reilly's speech was ok. It mostly focused on the idea that
the
next killer app would be to have applications run on the web instead
of
your desktop, Application Service Provider type of stuff. This isn't
something I'm excited about but I thought I would see where he was
going with it. His two big examples were Mapquest and Amazon.com.</P>

<P>Needless to say this didn't inspire me. Here I was at the Open
Source
Conference and the head dude at O'Reilly was using proprietary
examples for what he thinks are the "Next Big Thing". Sure it's nice
that Mapquest provides a good service, but Tim was talking about your
applications existing on the net. Lots of privacy and data ownership
issues to ponder and worry about.</P>

<P>An interesting talk, but I would hope for more from the head of a
company that is a major proponent of the Open Source movement.</P>

<P>Gregory Benford's speech was a good foil to Tim's. Its foundation
was
the ongoing war between personal privacy and marketing. It is becoming
easier and easier for marketers and advertisers to learn more about us
and thus create ads that are more precisely targeted.</P>

<P>The real ironic thing about it is that we, the development
community,
are the ones that is making it easier for them to invade our privacy.
As we
create more sophisticated applications to better serve customers we
are also
better able to track a consumer's spending habits as well as personal
habits
in general.</P>

<P>A very good keynote speech and something to definitely think
about.</P>

<P>The rest of the morning was filled up with some rather interesting
talks, but some of us continued with Dominus' BOF from the previous
night.
Fortunately, he could log into his web site and demo his cookbook
idea. Like I mentioned before it is basically a way to create
extensible documentation. If you didn't understand a term or
technique, you could expand that area and include it in your
"recipe".</P>

<P>After lunch was the Perl Golf Apocalypse. One of the events many
folks
were anxious to see. It had a rough start and eventually fizzled
because of some technical difficulties. Regardless, it is an
interesting contest and I hope that the hard work that was put into
this year will come to fruition in next year's TPC.</P>

<P>As a result, Damian Conway was asked to give an impromptu
presentation of his Perl and Quantum Computing speech that he gave at
YAPC this year. It was quite fascinating to see someone explain
"basic" quantum physics in about 10 minutes. Even better was his
continuation of these principles as they apply to quantum computing.
The foundation of which is the qubit. Where the bit as we think of it
has 2 states, a qubit can have infinite states (quantum
superposition). By just adding operators to Perl ('any' and 'all'),
one can do all sorts of interesting things. Lets just say that you
could do factorizations in constant time. Damian has actually
submitted to CPAN his module to do this, the documentation is <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/doc/DCONWAY/Quantum-Superpositions-1.03/lib/Quantum/Superpositions.pm">here</A>.
Though he didn't get to complete it, it was still a fascinating and
inspiring bit of work.</P>

<P>Previous to this, I was part of a group in the hallways that was
talking with Dr. Conway about this. He either has or will give this
talk to a variety  of audiences. Depending upon the audience the
speech comes off differently. In front of a Perl audience, it is
somewhat humorous and amazing. Quantum computing does that to us Perl
folks I guess. In front of physicists and those that are really
serious about quantum computing, it plays as a very serious piece of
work and a goal to strive for. It appears that observers can even
affect a talk about quantum computing. :-)</P>

<P>Then came the Perl Town Meeting. This is a fun thing since the
community gets to air questions, make comments, and generally express
to the community at large their concerns. Most of the questions dealt
with Perl 6, which was understandable considering the change this
means for Perl. Another large portion dealt with the conference
itself. How does TPC relate to what YAPC is doing, how can we make it
more affordable for all, and how we can make the conference better
overall.</P>

<P>I really enjoyed being able to attend the conference from beginning
to
end. I got to meet a lot of great people, put facesto  Usenet
postings, and in general learn more about the programming language
that is near and dear to me.  My thanks to O'Reilly and Nathan
Torkington for putting on a spectacular conference, thanks to all the
presenters and tutorial teachers, and thanks to Larry Wall for
creating a language that lets a diverse bunch of people work together
and apart so well.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<P>Day 6: July 21, 2000<BR><HR></P>

<P>Not much happened on my return trip other than spending about 20
hours
in airports/airplanes. It did give me plenty of time to read all of
the papers for the presentations I missed as well as go over the
tutorial workbooks, again.</P>
