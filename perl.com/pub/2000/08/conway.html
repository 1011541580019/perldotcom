<P><I>Dr. Damian Conway is best known in the United States for authoring </i>Object Oriented Perl<i>, published by Manning. His lectures at Perl conferences are becoming legendary and are a joy for Perl hackers of all levels. I managed to catch up with Dr. Conway just before his fall semester of lecturing at Monash University  in Australia began. 
</I></P>

<P><B>
Joe Johnston: Although you give a pretty decent account
 of your teaching career at 
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/bio.html">
 http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/bio.html</a>,
 could you state your day job for the record?
</B></P>

<P><B>Damian Conway</B>: </P>
Name: Conway, D. M.<BR>
Rank: Senior Lecturer, Computer Science, Monash University.<BR>
Serial number: 8371 466.

<P><B>
JJ:   Fred Brook's <U>Mythical Man Month</U> and <U>No Silver Bullet</U> 
   are classic
   essays on the business and art of software engineering. The main
   point of the former is that application developers need to be managed
   more like commissioned artists, rather than as factory workers. The
   later work suggests that there will never be a design tool that
   significantly makes software development schedules more
   deterministic. Are these works still relevant and do you have your
   undergrads read either of these?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
I often recommend "MMM" to my software engineering students, but mainly for the real life horror stories it includes.  They do a semester of SE and think they're ready to build their own operating system. Brooks' tales from the trenches are a useful antidote.

<P>Both books <em>are</em> still relevant, even though we're now living in The Future. The situations and problems they describe may be now mainly historical, but the underlying issues are perennial.

<P>Programming is a Dark Art, and it will always be. The programmer is
fighting against the two most destructive forces in the universe:
entropy and human stupidity. They're not things you can always overcome
with a "methodology" or on a schedule.

<P>And when you look at it, we haven't come that far in the quarter century since Brooks first published "MMM." Sure we have more development tools and techniques, but most of them (and most programming languages too!) don't really help. Especially not on large projects (i.e.,  anything over three or four developers).

<P>They're designed to force the software team into someone else's (usually academic) conception of how a program should be created.
Generally they advocate ways of working that make <em>no</em> allowance 
for the needs, motivations, and goals of the humans in the system. 
So Real Programmers don't use them, and programming stays a handicraft 
-- a multi-trillion dollar cottage industry.

<P>Of course, it would be easy to fix that: make the software vendors liable
for the correctness and reliability of their software and you'd see an 
instant revolution in development. There's plenty of research and practical
experience in building reliable systems using unreliable components (i.e., programmers). But as long a companies can turn a buck or two (billion) by shipping pre-beta quality software, why would they bother to find or mandate
better ways?

<P><B>JJ: There are those in the Open Source Community that point out that greed is not sufficient motivation to produce quality software, which is often the labor of love. How can Joe Programmer (not this Joe programmer) learn to love developing accounting applications?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
He or she <em>can't</em>. No more than you can make a COBOL 
programmer love
hacking kernel. People sometimes offer me contracts writing
DB interfaces or building websites, but I tell them I'm not worth
what I'd charge to do that. Because I'd be doing it strictly for the
(very large amount of) money, rather than for love of the project.
They wouldn't get my best. 

<P>Whatever software your trying to build, you need people who are inspired
by the <em>idea</em> of that software. Even if they aren't virtuoso hackers:
you can always teach a person to code better, or tidy their code after
it's written; you can <em>never</em> teach a person to love your project. And
without that emotional engagement, you'll never get the superhuman
effort that's required to produce quality software.

<P>It often seems to me that recruiters ask the wrong questions when
interviewing programmers. Sure you have to find out if they know the
difference between an argument and a parameter, but it's vastly more
important to discover what kind of enthusiasm and energy they're going
to bring to your project, why they'll put in 18-hour days on it, why
they'd pay <em>you</em> to work on it. Find those people and you'll get
quality accounting software.

<P>And in a roundabout way, that's why we need diversity in languages (and
<em>within</em> languages). So that there can be languages that fit a diversity
of brains. So that every kind of geek can find his or her passion. Many
of us love to diss COBOL and VB and Ada and PHP and Python, but we
need to remember that, without those languages and the brave souls
dedicated to -- and inspired by -- them, <em>we</em> would have to write
accounting software and bad GUIs and defence protocols and dull
websites. In Perl. <code>:-(</code>

<P><B>JJ: 
The world needs uncool software. Can we judge the
hepness of an application by its quality?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
No. Because to some folks it <em>really is</em> hip to be square. All you can
tell about quality software is that someone thought it was important enough
to care about, to invest themselves in. And people can feel that way about
the oddest, unheppest things: model trains, mime, cloisonne eggs, folk
dancing, even accounting applications.

<P><B>JJ: At Perl Conference 4.0, the Best Technical Paper award was renamed the Damian Conway Award. I don't even have a name on my office door. Will you be posing for the award statue?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
I'm only 5'6''. Put me on a block of marble and I could <em>be</em> 
the award statue!

<P><B>JJ: That won't work. You wouldn't stand still long 
enough to present the award.
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
That could be the criterion: to win the award you have 
to keep up with it <code>:-)</code>

<P><B>JJ: 
If a calendar of Perl Hunks were assembled, which 
month would you be?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC</B>:
JJ: You <em>have</em> to get off the drugs, Joe! And soon!
A Perl Hunk calendar??? How sick is that?

<P>Oh, very well then: August.

<P><B>JJ: This just in from the Perl section of <u>Teen Beat</U>, what tunes are on your CD/LP/MP3 player these days?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
<UL>
 <LI>"Five", J.J.Cale
 <LI>"Oxygene", Jean-Michel Jarre
 <LI>"'Gladiator' soundtrack", Zimmer & Gerrard
 <LI>"'Sense & Sensibility' soundtrack", Carl Davis
</UL>

<P><B>JJ: 
Speaking of fluff, Paul Allen has been <em>real</em> busy 
spending money these days. From
seeding Transmeta to donating millions to the Search for
ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI), Allen has been spreading his Microsoft millions liberally. What projects would you like to fund with your future trillions?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
C'mon! I'm a mad scientist/hacker from Australia.
I <em>seriously</em> doubt I will ever have major disposable income.

<P>But if I did, I'd be funding:

<OL>
   <LI> Nanotechnology. I <em>want</em> microbots tending each blade of grass on my lawn and quitely rolling dust and dirt off my floors.

   <LI> Vacuum point energy research. I hate having to recharge lap-top batteries. Energy wants to be Free.

   <LI> Gerontology. We only get one go, and 100 years isn't nearly long enough. 

   <LI> Education. Better education reduces world misery in so many ways. It fights poverty, overpopulation, prejudice, and tyranny.

   <LI> People. I'd spend my time finding humanity's best and most creative people, and just pay them to be them. Sure, you might not pick the right person 9 times out of 10. But what if the tenth were another Mary Shelley, or Frank Lloyd Wright, or Murasaki Shikibu, or Larry Wall?

    <LI> A Buddhist monastery. Peace is a renewable resource, but the world lacks enough processing capacity.
</UL>

<P><B>JJ: For the people that have read your book "Object Oriented Perl" or heard your conference lectures, your commitment to bring respectability to Perl's OO model is well known. Oddly enough, you have seem to have other comp sci interests. What is "automation of hypermedia" and how does it apply to user interfaces?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
Anyone who has put together a large website knows how long and hard the process is. Anyone who has tried to use a large website knows how rarely the process is done well.

<P>For a time, I was developing tools to make it possible to generate navigable, comprehensible, usable websites with nothing more that vi. I
developed a system that used text files for content, with very minimal
mark-up, to generate full websites for various programming courses I was
running. It would index all the material, cross-reference it, annotate
it with exercises, hyperlink it back to glossaries and bibliographies,
construct course syllabuses and outlines, etc., etc.

<P>And, of course, it was all done with a single, rambling, arcane,
semi-sentient Perl program <code>:-)</code>


<P><B>JJ: 
Have you used HTML::Template or HTML::Mason? Both allow 
Perl to be embedded in an otherwise static HTML page. This 
is sort of the server-side include method as used by ASP 
and Cold Fusion.
</B></P>

<P><B>DC</B>:
I haven't used them, but I've heard very good things about both modules.


<P><B>JJ: 
More generally, is Perl ready for next generation web applications
or are Perl tools not evolving fast enough for very large websites
with large and diverse development teams?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
I'm not sure anyone or any tool is ready for the demands of mega-websites, anymore than existing software development approaches are ready for Programming In The Very Large. I don't think we know how to reliably
create huge linear programs that are safe, robust, and efficient. Add
in the web's demands for multimedia, hyperconnectivity, and interactivity,
and I think our software technologies are at least a decade behind demand.
   
<P><B>
Some parent groups in the U.S. question whether computers are having a positive impact on children. They claim that video games are not meaningfully more interactive than Plain Old TV (POTV). Should any nation eschew raising teachers' salaries in favor of installing classroom computers? Are the Luddites right?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
Technology is not the enemy. <em>Deification</em> of technology is the enemy.

<P>Any nation that favours a technological fix over funding good teaching is going to get what it deserves: neither a technological fix, nor good teaching.

<P>Western culture is increasing about magic bullets. We think a pill or a weekend course or a laying-on-of-hands is going to instantly solve our problem. As though we lived in a weekly sitcom with a 30-minute story arc.

<P>Putting computers in classrooms instead of teachers is doing just that: Latching on to a single "quick fix".

<P>Of course, you do have to give the kids access to the technology. Not doing so nowadays is as criminal as not teaching them to read. But you still have to teach them to read, and think, and learn, as well!

<P>Put 30 kids in a room with an easel, a computer, and a guitar. You'll get one Van Gogh, one Von Neumann, and one Van Halen (or Van Morrison). And 27 burger flippers. <code>:-(</code>

<P>Every child has some great potential, but almost all of them need help to find it, and nurture it, and control it, and master it. They need a teacher, a guide, a role model. No machine is going to give them that. At least, not for a long time yet.

<P><B>JJ: 
The big news at TPC 4.0 of course was Perl Episode 6, 
The Phantom Rewrite. What are three (or more) things you'd 
most like to see addressed in this reconstruction?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
Well, I have a list of 40 or so things I'm hoping to propose for Perl 6.
The big ones include:

<UL>
        <LI> Getting rid of the requirement for a final true value in
          <code>require</code>'d files

        <LI> Finding a better name for <code>local</code>

        <LI> Making == work more DWIMly on numeric operands strings

        <LI> New control structures: co-routines, switch statement,
          multiway comparisons

        <LI> Fixing the nested iteration behaviour of hashes

        <LI> Redesigning the format syntax and make it a subroutine in a pragma

        <LI> Subroutine parameter lists and extra context specifiers

        <LI> Numerous enhancements to OO Perl:
      <UL>
                <LI> hierarchical construction and destruction
                <LI> built-in encapsulation of attributes
                <LI> extended, integrated operator overloading 
                <LI> multimethods
                <LI> method redispatch
                <LI> method pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants
                     (also for ordinary subroutines)
      </UL>
      
        <LI> Regular expression matching against subroutines and filehandles

        <LI> Run-time access to source code parse tree, and simpler
          source filters

        <LI> Higher order functions

        <LI> Lazy evaluation of subroutine argument lists

        <LI> Extended context detection features 

        <LI> Superpositions
</UL>


<P><B>JJ: 
What are the three scariest nightmares the corporate 
world has about Perl that prevent wider adoption of our
favorite language?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC</B>:
I don't know very much about the corporate world, but I guess three common
fears might be:

<UL>
        <LI><DL> 
     <DT>Perl is unclassifiable</DT>

     <DD>
               COBOL is a banking language, Fortran is a numerical
                computation language, C is a systems programming language,
                Visual Basic is a GUI applications language, Java is a
                web programming language. What is Perl?
  </DD>
   </DL>

        <LI><DL>
     <DT>Perl is unmaintainable</DT>

     <DD>Line noise programs, numerous defaults, subtle context propagation, symbolic references, closures, unconstrained OO model, one-liners, weird modules maintained by weirder hackers, typeglobs, AUTOLOADING, operator overloading, source filters, etc., etc.
     </DD>
     </DL>
     
        <LI><DL> 
 <DT>Perl is unsupported</DT>

        <DD>Yeah, I know, I know. But there's no $599 MS-Perl with a GUI interface and an exorbitant support contract.</DD>
 </DL>
</UL>

<P>The Perl Mongers are making valiant in-roads against those perceptions, but they can't make Perl the static, commercial, boring tool that many managers are used to. And hence comfortable with.

<P>We'll have to wait until the grunts who are actually using Perl in the trenches -- and holding entire organizations together with it -- get promoted into management. For them, Perl <em>will</em> be the safe and
familiar option.


<P><B>JJ: 
You're a big burly OO dude. Why aren't you programming
in Python?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
When you live in Australia, you learn to be wary of snakes.

<P>Seriously though, I don't use Python because I'm not
<em>just</em> a big burly OO dude. I'm also a frightening
functional dude, and a devious declarative dude, and an
insidious imperative dude. In order to mess with
people's minds, I need to be able to mess with a
programming language's syntax and semantics: add a
switch statement, change the dispatch model, superimpose
scalars, lock down hash access, intercept error messages
and convert them to haiku, impose design-by-contract
constraints, or reconstruct the language in Latin or
Klingon. Only Perl lets me push (fold, spindle,
multilate) the envelope like that.

<P><B>JJ: 
What's your favorite part of your native country?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
The hilly spa country around Daylesford, Victoria.
Rolling green hills, temperate climate, clean air, perfect.

<P><B>JJ: 
The US "Dot.COMomy" has become colder than a bartender 
after closing time. Will those programmers who have only 
been in start-ups have a hard time adjusting to an economy
in which they aren't lusted after like jade idols?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC:</B>
Good programmers will always be in demand -- there are so few of them around. And computers and the Internet are here to stay, even after the hype has died.

<P>Those refugees from Start-Ups are not going to see the same mania for
their services, but they'll still see good salaries and packages. What
they'll have trouble adjusting to is an economy where they're expected
to perform within the rules, keep office hours, wear shoes, write
reports, cut code to spec rather than because it's cool. That's going to
hurt. But the companies that survive will survive because they extract
more value from their employees than those employees cost. In that
sense, there is no "new" economy.

<P>The down side is that, in the future, you'll have to be right on the end
of the bell curve to offer your boss enough value to justify the cost of
your bohemian behaviour.

<P><B>JJ: 
If Perl were to disappear tomorrow, what would 
its legacy be?
</B></P>

<P><B>DC</B>
That programing languages should be made to fit humans, not vice versa.
