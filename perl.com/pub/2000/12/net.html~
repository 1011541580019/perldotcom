<h2>What Every Perl Programmer Needs to Know About .NET</h2>
<!::field::id-author::before=by+::>

<p>.NET is the latest hype blitz from Microsoft (and you thought it was
just a domain).  If your eyes are glazing over or you're tempted to write
it off as marketing speak, read on.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft is loath to admit it, .NET is really their
answer to Sun.  The Java language, the Java virtual machine and
CORBA have proved to be a threat.  .NET is the umbrella name for Microsoft's attempt to better Sun.</p>

<p>Whereas Java is the programming language for Sun's "computer is the
network" effort, Microsoft has given us C# ("C sharp").  It's derived
from C, and attempts to avoid some of the pitfalls of Java and C++.
And much as Java compiles down to Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
instructions, C# compiles down to Intermediate Language (IL).</p>

<p>Where Microsoft betters Sun is that while Java is the only real
language that compiles to the JVM, Microsoft intends IL to be
cross-language.  That is, Perl, Visual Basic and C# can  be
compiled down to IL.  The idea is to make it possible to
integrate multiple languages into one system.</p>

<p>Sun chose CORBA as its distributed application platform, but Microsoft
has gone with SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).  In my opinion,
SOAP has one huge benefit over CORBA: mere mortals can implement it!
Soap uses HTTP to send XML-encoded instance and method calls on
remotely defined objects and receive return values.  The umbrella term
for SOAP and its cousin XML-RPC is "Web Services."  There are already
SOAP and XML-RPC modules for Perl.</p>

<p>While it's still early days for .NET, and there's still considerable
potential for it all to turn out to be vaporware, Microsoft has begun
to release .NET components.  And it's not just Microsoft - a number of
people are using SOAP to give concrete APIs to their Web-based
systems.  Think of all the times you've tried to parse HTML to extract
information - the SOAP way of the future is for that information to be
directly accessible through SOAP calls.  As I said, this is already
happening.</p>

<p>I've heard .NET described as "Microsoft's tacit admission that most
shops are not 100 percent Microsoft, so Microsoft products need to work
better with other platforms."  There are many places for Perl in this
new world:</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>In the back-end, serving data through SOAP.  Be warned that even
   <code>SOAP::Lite</code> has a bit of a learning curve, but there are already
   solid modules for this:</p>

<li> <p>In the front-end, compiling down to IL.  Jan Dubois of Activestate
   has a research project related to this:</p>

<h3>More Information</h3>

<p>So where can you learn more?  Microsoft has a lot of information about
.NET, of course.</p>

<p>There's an introduction from the Windows point of view (covering
the plans for COM and ADO and all the other Windowsy things I didn't
mention):</p>

<p>Your best bet for things you can use now, though, are the SOAP and
XML-RPC modules.  Be warned: The SOAP modules are hard to get into.</p>
