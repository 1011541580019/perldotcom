<br />
<br /><P>I think programming language advocacy is a big problem, not just for
the Perl community, but for the larger programming community.</P>
<P>I'm going to start with an example of the same phenomenon in a
different community, then work around to programming languages.  In
his <cite>Baseball Abstract 1985</cite>, Bill James wrote:</P>
<blockquote>
        Why are our information systems about managers so backward?
        Because we have gotten trapped in an unresolvable issue about
        whether a manager is &quot;good&quot; or is &quot;bad.&quot;  The fan, beginning
        with a position on the goodness or the badness of the manager
        in question, interprets each action in the light of that
        reference and makes every question about him an extension of
        the first principle. . . .  Beginning with the premise that
        Bill Virdon stinks, every other question becomes a sub-heading
        of why Bill Virdon stinks.
</blockquote>
<P>James tried to make a beginning on the problem of evaluating baseball
managers by making a simple, qualitative assessment of different
managers' styles.  He put together a questionnaire with questions like
``Does he stay with the starter, or go to the bullpen quickly?'' and
``Does he pinch-hit much, and if so when?''  Then he circulated the
questionnaire, asking baseball fans to describe the managers with whom
they were most familiar.</P>
<P>James got a surprise: Questionnaires came back with vituperative
complaints about managerial behavior: ``This is where we see Bill
Virdon's real preference: go with the starter 'til he drops.  Hell,
Virdon makes Billy Martin look like a wimp, Simon Legree like a
quiche-eater.''  How long will he stay with a starter who is
struggling?  ``Exactly one batter too long, or until he faints,
whichever comes first.''  And so on.</P>
<P>This didn't help James at all.  He was trying to understand baseball
managers qualitatively, without judging in advance whether they were
'good' or 'bad'.  ``What Stan has done with the form of the managerial
box,`` wrote James, ''is precisely what I designed the thing to try to
lead the discussion away from.`` But baseball fans had so many years of
experience in making these judgments that they no longer knew how to
talk about managers in any other terms.  Even when the fans made simple,
descriptive statements, other fans inevitably understood these as
either indictments or praises.  Discourse about managerial style was
essentially impossible, except at this very low level of ''Bill Virdon
is a great manager!``  ''No he isn't!``</P>
<P>
<!-- <A NAME="what does this have to do with programming languages">What Does this Have to Do With Programming Languages?</A> -->
<P>I think this same thing has happened to programming language
discussions.  Advocacy has become so natural to us that we forget
there is any other way to discuss programming languages.  Even if we
don't forget, other people can't understand us because they <EM>hear</EM>
advocacy whether we want them to or not.</P>
<P>Here's an example, parallel to the baseball example.  About two years
ago I was giving a talk to the local Perl user group about strong
typing semantics.  (I can't get into details here, but the complete
talk is available at <A HREF="http://perl.plover.com/yak/typing/">http://perl.plover.com/yak/typing/</A>)</P>
<P>I explained what types were, and said that a lot of people had
concluded that strong typing was a failed experiment, based in part on
the success of weakly typed languages like Perl and in part on an idea of the state of the art that was 
twenty-five years out of date.</P>
<P>Then I gave a counterexample: I discussed the typing system in
Standard ML, which is more recent, and showed how it fixed many of the
big problems of other typing systems and also provided a lot of unexpected
advantages.   Part way through the explanation, one of the
audience members raised his hand and asked ``But what's wrong with the
way Perl does it?''</P>
<P>I was taken aback.  I hadn't said anything was wrong with the way Perl
did it.  In fact, I'd specifically said that Perl's approach had been
a big success.  But somehow, people in my audience had gotten the idea
that because I was pointing out benefits of Standard ML, I must be
saying that Standard ML was good and Perl was bad.  Apparently it was
inconceivable that there might be <EM>two</EM> right ways to do something.</P>
<P>
<!-- <A NAME="my country right or wrong">``My Country Right or Wrong''</A> -->
<P>In that talk I discussed the Pascal type system at some length.  There
was only one reason that I brought up Pascal.  I needed
to convince people that type systems have moved forward a little since
the invention of Pascal in 1968.  I had found from many
years of experience that when I mentioned strong typing, people would
frequently say ``You must be kidding.  Pascal sucks.''  I knew that if I
did not address Pascal, people would be unpersuaded by my
talk---they might go home thinking I was advocating Pascal as soon as I mentioned strong typing.  So I spent a lot of time discussing
the particular failures of the Pascal type system so that I could show
how these problems are surmountable---Pascal is not the be-all and
end-all of strong typing, as many people think.  I discussed C at the
same time, because the C and Pascal type systems are so similar, and I
did not want people to think I was singling out Pascal.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, several people have written to me to complain that my
talk was 'unfair to Pascal'.  They saw the talk as an attack on their
favorite language.  I don't understand this.  Even if the talk had
been about Pascal, which it wasn't, it couldn't have been an attack,
because I only told the truth about Pascal.  The Pascal type system
<EM>does</EM> have big problems, many of which were corrected in various
incompatible ways by various vendors, and many of which were corrected
by Wirth, the inventor of Pascal, in his later languages.</P>
<P>You can be 'unfair' to a person, and you can hurt their feelings, even
if you tell only the truth.  But Pascal is a programming language, not
a person.  It has no feelings to hurt.  Criticizing Pascal's type
system is like complaining that your hammer has a scratched face.
There is no use getting upset about it.  You just have to get a new
hammer or make do.  Saying that the criticism is unfair to the hammer,
for whatever reason, is just silly.</P>
<P>I think I know what happened here, but I'd like to discuss it a little
later.</P>
<P>
<!-- <A NAME="you know we do this too!">You know we do this too!</A> -->
<P>I got mail a couple of days ago from Jasmine Merced-Ownby, who runs
the <a href="http://www.perlarchive.com/">Perl Archive</a> web site.  Part of the site had been
implemented with PHP, and she was getting letters from people who were
concerned that this 'made Perl look bad'.</P>
<P>I guess an implicit admission that Perl might not be the very best
tool for every possible job could be construed as making Perl look
bad, but it seems like an awfully peculiar response, unless you
imagine Perl and PHP engaged in a war from which there can be only one
victor, and unless you think that if PHP is good for something,
anything at all, then Perl must be bad.</P>
<P>I don't recall that Perl has ever been advertised as the One Tool for
Every Job.  Perl came into a world full of other tools and made a name
for itself as a 'glue language' that can help a lot of other tools
inter-operate.  Perl fills in the spaces between the other tools.  That
alone is impressive and useful.  In the past ten years, more and more,
Perl has worked well in place of the other tools; that's even better.
But Perl's motto is ``There's More Than One Way To Do It'', and
sometimes that means that one of the ways is to use PHP.  If PHP comes
up a little short for some reason, maybe Perl can fill in the gap.  I
understand that PHP can call out to a Perl program for help.  If
that's true, it's not an admission of failure; it's because Rasmus
Lerdorf, the author, was smart.  Perl can call out to C for help, and
that's not an admission of failure either.  The best glues can stick
to everything.</P>
<P>In my world, PHP can be a good solution, and Perl can be a good
solution, because maybe a problem can have more than one good solution.  In my
world you use what works, and using PHP can't possibly reflect badly
on Perl.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="more stories">More Stories</A></H2>
<P>Here's another example, I think of the same thing.  If you look in
perlfaq4, you'll see a question that says ``<a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlfaq4.html#How%20do%20I%20handle%20linked%20lists%3f">How do I handle linked
lists?</a>''  The answer begins by saying ``In general, you usually don't
need a linked list in Perl,'' which is exactly the right answer, and
then goes on to explain how Perl arrays serve most of the purposes of
linked lists.  For example, people like to use linked lists to
represent stacks in C; in Perl, the right approach is to use the
<CODE>push()</CODE> and <CODE>pop()</CODE> functions on an array instead.</P>
<P>But after explaining that linked lists are rarely useful in Perl, the
manual goes on to show an implementation of linked lists: ``If you
really, really wanted, you could use structures...'' and then the code
follows.  Avi recently asked me why it bothers to show an
implementation, when it says before and after that the implementation
is not useful for anything.</P>
<P>I tried to put myself in the position of the FAQ authors, and ask why
I would do such a thing.  The first answer I thought of was that I
might do it to show off my erudition.  But then a better answer came
to mind.</P>
<P>Of course, this is just a guess, but if I had been writing the FAQ, I would have been afraid to say ``You
don't need linked lists in Perl'' and leave it at that, because I would
have imagined someone reading that answer and concluding that it was
an evasion and that linked lists couldn't be done at all in Perl.  Avi
seemed shocked that I could be so cynical, but I think a lot of
people do think that way.  Why might someone conclude that the answer
was an evasion?  If your belief is that the author of the Perl manual
will never say anything bad about even the worst parts of Perl, then
you will try to read between the lines.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="drink the koolaid">Drink the Kool-Aid</A></H2>
<P>I think the root of the problem is that we tend to organize ourselves
into tribes.  Then people in the tribe are our friends, and people
outside are our enemies.  I think it happens like this: Someone uses
Perl, and likes it, and then they use it some more.  But then
something strange happens.  They start to identify themselves with
Perl, as if Perl were part of their body, or vice versa.  They're part
of the Big Perl Tribe.  They want other people to join the Tribe.  If
they meet someone who doesn't like Perl, it's an insult to the Tribe
and a personal affront to them.</P>
<P>I think that explains the reaction of the folks who wrote to me to
complain about my unfairness to Pascal.  I think maybe they took it
personally, and felt that I was being unfair to <EM>them</EM>.</P>
<P>Getting yourself confused with a programming language isn't a sane
thing to do, but a lot of people do it, including people from our
community.</P>
<P>I'm not the only person who suspects this.  This section's title,
``Drink the Kool-Aid,'' comes from a great talk by Nat Torkington from
last year's YAPC.  The title of Nat's talk was ``<a href="http://prometheus.frii.com/~gnat/yapc/2000-advocacy/">Be an advocate, not an
asshole.</a>''  Nat's talk has a slide on why people do advocacy.  People
he asked gave a few different answers, which he mentions.  But then he
says: ``My secret suspicion is that a lot of third-party advocacy is
just: Perl is the way and the light, man, so drink the Kool-Aid and
ascend to programmer heaven.''  I wouldn't have put it that way, but I
have the same suspicion.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="so what is the problem">So What is the Problem?</A></H2>
<P>Why should we try to get out of this mentality?  What's the big deal?</P>
<P>One big problem with thinking and talking like this is that it means
we can't learn anything new.  Suppose that PHP has some advantage over
Perl that would lead Jasmine to use it in place of Perl on her web
site.  If that's true, wouldn't it be cool if  Perl could copy that
advantage in the next version?</P>
<P>If you approach PHP with the idea that it has to be destroyed or shut
out, that Perl is Right and Everything Else is Messed Up, you aren't
going to find out what PHP's advantages are.  You aren't going to be
in a state of mind that can recognize that PHP has something good that
Perl doesn't.</P>
<P>Maybe there are ideas in modern strong typing systems that would
improve Perl in the future; maybe not.  But if you approach the strong
typing discussion with a fixed notion that there must be something
wrong with it just because it's different from the way Perl works now,
you're not going to learn anything.</P>
<P>Perl got where it is today by copying a lot of stuff from a lot of
other languages.  Perl's most famous features, hashes and regexes, are
copied from Unix utilities like AWK, grep, and sed.  Perl's statement
modifiers are borrowed from BASIC-plus, of all places.  Perl even has
features that are borrowed from Ada, including one feature you use every day.</P>
<P>Perl's growth won't stop if Perl stops copying stuff from other
languages, but it will slow down.  Drastically.  And Perl might stop
being Perl.  I'm glad I wasn't stuck with Perl 4.036 for the last
seven years, and I don't want to be stuck with Perl 5.6.0 for the next
ten years either.  Borrowing from other languages has been good for
Perl.  To keep doing it, we have to be able to look at other languages
and we have to be in a frame of mind to recognize the good stuff when
we see it.</P>
<P>One of the things I found most dismaying about the Perl 6 RFC process
was the parochialism of many of the submissions.  The submitter would
be trying to solve some problem, and would come up with a crappy
solution.  And meanwhile, there would be a perfectly serviceable
solution in the language next door, just waiting to be reused.  But it
seemed as though a lot of the people making proposals only knew Perl,
and not any other languages.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="perl programmers">Perl Programmers</A></H2>
<P>Here's another problem with this us-versus-them discourse.  People
now identify me as a 'Perl Programmer'.  They automatically assume
that everything that comes out of my mouth will be colored by that,
that I'm going to love everything about Perl and hate everything else.
If I do say anything negative about Perl, some people assume that the
real truth must be ten times worse than what I would admit to.  It can
be hard for me to make myself understood.  Tribal assumptions are
impeding communication.  I can't be the only one with this problem.</P>
<P>I don't think of myself as a Perl Programmer.  I program in maybe half
a dozen languages regularly, whatever's convenient.  I've been a
programmer since about 1978.  When folks call me a Perl Programmer, it
never seems to occur to them that ten years ago they would have
thought I was ``C Programmer'' and twenty years ago I would have been a
``Fortran Programmer''.  But they still won't take me seriously when I
talk about strong typing systems, because what does a Perl Programmer
know about strong typing?  If I make a simple factual statement, like
``Standard ML has strong static typing'', people are apt to conclude
from that that I think strong static typing is a bad idea, just
because I said that Standard ML has it, and Mark Dominus is a Perl
Programmer, not a Standard ML Programmer.</P>
<P>Bill James complained about almost the same thing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Facing the question of &quot;what is his strongest point as a
        manager,&quot; I wrote for Sparky Anderson &quot;His record.&quot;  I thought
        that this was rather complimentary. . . But if you start with
        the assumption that I'm going to be ripping Sparky, then
        innocent comments become loaded with double meanings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="it gets worse">It Gets Worse</A></H2>
<P>Maybe the biggest problem with the ``Perl good, others bad'' rut is that
it's going to impede our ability to communicate with <EM>ourselves</EM>.</P>
<P>If we decide that the Perl Way is the One True Way, then when someone
appears and asks why <CODE>length(@a)</CODE> does the wrong thing, we're not
going to have an intelligent answer.  We're going to come up with a
lot of blather about <CODE>length()</CODE>'s argument always being in a scalar
context, yak yak yak.  Listen, bub, I know all about scalar context,
and I still think <CODE>length(@a)</CODE> is a rotten idea and <CODE>length(%h)</CODE> is
even worse.  Perl won big because it does what you mean, even when that isn't
orthogonal.   There's no way that <CODE>length(@a)</CODE> is doing what you mean.</p>

<p>Someone showed up in <CODE>comp.lang.perl.misc</CODE> this week asking why
<CODE>length(@a)</CODE> does the Wrong Thing, and nobody gave any indication
that anyone agreed with him.  I guess they were all too busy defending
Tribal Turf or something.  <a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/212.pod">RFC 212</a>
proves that <EM>someone</EM> out there agrees with this guy.  But
nobody would admit it.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="any other problems">Any Other Problems?</A></H2>
<P>I'm glad you asked.  Us-versus-them is not a way to be an effective
advocate.  Says Nat: ``Passion doesn't convince. Passion makes you look
like an idiot or an asshole.''  Telling someone that Perl is great and
their thing sucks isn't going to persuade anyone of anything.  This
style of advocacy may be fun and easy, but it isn't effective.  You
have to lead people, not drive them before you.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="conclusion">Conclusion</A></H2>
<P>I don't really hate advocacy.  I just hate the way we do it most of
the time.  We do it in a dumb way.  And I think the discoursive habits
we pick up as a result are going to impede the progress of programming
languages for a long time.  </P>
<P>Perl has a strong tradition of getting along with (and borrowing from) 
other languages and other systems.  That's one of its greatest
strengths.  Let's not throw that away.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        I have a book on my bookshelf that I've never read, but that
        has a great title. It says, &quot;All Truth is God's Truth.&quot; And I
        believe that. The most viable belief systems are those that
        can reach out and incorporate new ideas, new memes, new
        metaphors, new interfaces, new extensions, new ways of doing
        things. My goal this year is to try to get Perl to reach out
        and cooperate with Java. I know it may be difficult for some
        of you to swallow, but Java is not the enemy.  Nor is Lisp, or
        Python, or Tcl. That is not to say that these languages don't
        have good and bad points. I am not a cultural relativist. Nor
        am I a linguistic relativist. In case you hadn't noticed. :-)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Two points if you can guess who said that.</P>
