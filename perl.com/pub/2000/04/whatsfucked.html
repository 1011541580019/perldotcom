Perl 5.6.0 has now been officially unleashed on an unsuspecting world, to
the sound of some rejoicing. I'm sure you're all going to be innundated
with the news of all the new bells and whistles it possesses, and be
absolutely delighted with a whole host of new things you're never going to
use. So with further ado, let's take a few sober moments to look over its
brand new misfeatures, additional bugs, and collateral damages.

<P>
The covert operation to take over the hard disk drives of the world is
continuing succesfully; the steady increase in core size has now
surruptitiously doubled since the previous major release. Congratulations
to all concerned!

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Unicode">Unicode</A></H1>
<P>
To be fair, most of that increase has been due to the addition of Unicode
support. After two years of hard hacking, Perl's Unicode support is now at
the stage where we can't even read in a Unicode file. 

<P>
The much vaunted `input line disciplines' feature allows you to mark an
incoming file as UTF8 encoded, pass it through filters, specify a
non-standard newline sequence, and so on. On an unfortunate practical note,
however, Perl 5.6.0 neglects to implement it.

<P>
Never mind, though, there is a workaround. The translation operator can now
convert between byte-encoded and Unicode representations, so you can simply
pull in your data as normal and then convert it, by doing something like
this:

<P>
<PRE>        open IN, $file or die;
        while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
                tr///CU;
                ...
        }
</PRE>
<P>
There's just one slight problem with this - it causes Perl to dump core on
some systems.

<P>
The shift to a new Perl version syntax has led to a mad desire to shoehorn
the comparison operators to work with these new version numbers. The upshot
of all this was a momentous decision to allow version numbers to be
represented as Unicode strings. Now if we say
<CODE>102.111.111</CODE>, we're actually referring to the string <CODE>&quot;foo&quot;</CODE>. This reasonably obvious direction has, for some reason, blown the minds
of almost all the porters. Why? Who knows. Maybe you can tell me - which of
the below are equivalent, and which are different:

<P>
<PRE>        5.6 5.006 &quot;5.6&quot; 5.6.0 &quot;5.6.0&quot; &quot;\x{5}\x{6}&quot; &quot;\x{5}\x{6}\x{0}&quot; v5.6
        v5.006 v5.6.0 &quot;\x5\x6&quot; &quot;\x5\x6\x0&quot;
</PRE>
<P>
Oh, and you never called a subroutine <CODE>v</CODE><EM>some_number</EM>, did you? Of course. Nobody would do a thing like that.

<P>
Perl now boasts reduced support for an increased number of platforms: those
of you compiling on AIX will be for a particularly tough ride, while DJGPP,
Cygnus and Windows users have all reported build failures - guess you'll
just have to use the ActiveState port, eh?

The compiler looked to be slipping a little since the last release; work
had been progressing steadily, it was passing many more of the test sets
and was actually in danger of stabilizing. 

<P>
However, bugs introduced between the release candidates and the official
release appear to have cured this; the Deparse and Assembler backends are
now completely non-functional, the Bytecode backend now only works during
certain phases of the moon, and the optimised C backend is in a world of
its own. Hooray!

Just like the compiler, pseudohashes

All this has come at a price,
