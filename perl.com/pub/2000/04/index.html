</P>

<P>

The discussion of Simon's trial implementation of line disciplines
continued, with Sarathy, Ilya, Nick Ing-Simmons, and Larry
participating.  Some topics of discussion: How do disciplines interact
with end-of-line location?  Will a discipline request data
character-by-character from the discipline below it, or can it request
lines or larger chunks?  Does a filter transform a file object into
another file object, or does it transform an SV into another SV?  In
either case, what to do with the current 
<CODE>sv_gets</CODE> function that reads
a line from a file and passes the resulting line upwards as an SV?
What is the real meaning of 
<CODE>:raw</CODE>?  Is it a filter, or an indication
that filters should not be used?  What happens to 
<CODE>$/</CODE> in the presence of disciplines?  What does 
<CODE>sysread</CODE> do when buffering is being provided by some line discipline? (Larry's
 answer to this last:  It calls the low-level 
<CODE>read()</CODE> function, bypassing the disciplines, as usual.)
</P>

<P>
Paul Moore asked what the benefit of line disciplines is that is not
shared by tied filehandles.  The answer was 'speed'.  Tied filehandles
have all the overhead of objects and method calls.
<H3><a name="Ben_Tilly_Fixes_[map]">Ben Tilly Fixes <code>map</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Last week, I reported on all the interesting topics raised by Ben
Tilly, including an opservation that the 
<CODE>grep</CODE> code is optimized for the assumption that the output will be smaller
than (or the same size as) the input, which is a good assumption.
However, the  
<CODE>map</CODE> code, which is derived from 
<CODE>grep</CODE>, is optimized the same way, but in this case the assumption is
totally wrong.  Ben pointed out that you can rewrite a version of 
<CODE>map</CODE> <i>in Perl</i> that is faster than the builtin 
<CODE>map</CODE> for many common cases.  He even suggested how this might be fixed,
 and I regretfully observed that he did not provide a patch.
</P>

<P>
Apparently spurred by this, Ben submitted a patch!  Woo-hoo!
<H3><a name="Gack__Big_Bug_in_56">Gack!  Big Bug in 5.6</a></H3>

Larry Rosler pointed out that

</P><PRE>
        perl -e "my $x = 10; $x = '2' . $x; print $x + 0"
</PRE>

<P>
prints 
<CODE>10</CODE> instead  of 
<CODE>210</CODE>.  Whoops.  Simon Cozens provided a patch.  5.6.1 anybody?
<H3><a name="More_[pack]_Options">More <code>pack</code> Options</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

John Holdsworth added more features to 
pack]
 to better support Sun's XDR (external data representation) formats,
 which is something I haven't looked at since about 1990.  His change
 also supports 
<CODE>?</CODE> as a length specifier, saying that the length can be found in the
 data.  Ilya found fault with this; he thinks it is not general enough.
</P>

<P>
For me this discussion is reminiscent of a long discussion from last
year in which Ilya wanted to introduce a feature that would make data
self-unpacking; it would carry its own template with it.

</P>

<P>

I submitted a little patch to add a new diagnostic message, and Ron
Kimball pointed out that I had put the message into the wrong part of 
<CODE>perldiag</CODE>.   The messages in 
<CODE>perldiag</CODE> are supposed to be in alphabetical order, but in 5.6 there are a
 bunch that are just tacked onto the end in their own miniature
 alphabetical order, and I had added mine there by mistake.
</P>

<P>
I re-alphabetized the whole thing with a different (and more
consistent) alphabetic scheme.

</P>

<P>

If you try to use a 
<CODE>sort</CODE> comparator function when either of the magical variables 
<CODE>$a</CODE> or 
<CODE>$b</CODE> has been declared to have lexical scope, the comparator won't work,
 because it is looking at the lexical variables, and 
<CODE>sort</CODE> is leaving the values to be compared in the global variables.
 There's a diagnostic for this:
</P>

</P><PRE>
        Can't use "my $a" in sort comparison
</PRE>

<P>
Here's what 
<CODE>perldiag</CODE> says about it:
</P>

</P><PRE>
     (F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
     You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the <=> or cmp operator,
     and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
     Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
     lexical variable.
</PRE>

<P>
Peter Scott points out that this is not very nice---it only detects
uses of 
<CODE>$a</CODE> that appear in comparisons; in particular, the following code does
 not produce the diagnostic, although it should:
</P>

</P><PRE>
        my $a;
        my @sorted_list = sort { sortfunc($a, $b) } @list;
</PRE>

<P>
I know there are many people out there looking for a not-too-difficult
core hacking project to get started on.  Fixing this might be such a
project.
<H3><a name="[glob]_function_not_documented"><code>glob()</code> function not documented</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Randal pointed out that the 
<CODE>File::Glob</CODE> man page, which is the default globber for the 5.6.0 
<CODE>glob()</CODE> function, does not say what the function actually does.  For example,
 does this globber support the csh-style 
<CODE>{foo,bar,baz}</CODE> notation?  Perhaps
someone would like to rectify this?
<H3><a name="Overloading_Assignment">Overloading Assignment</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

You can't use the overload mechanism to overload assignment, but you
can use the 
<CODE>tie</CODE> mechanism.  Jeff Pinyan posted an example module that wraps up
 overloaded assignment semantics for a module.  Damian replied that he
 has a paper about that.  Discussion went offlist.

</P>

<P>

POSIX Character Classes (new in 5.6) do not work in the 
<CODE>tr</CODE> operator.  Since
<CODE>\d</CODE> and  
<CODE>\w</CODE>, and character classes generally also do not work there, it is not a
big surprise. Summary:

<H3><a name="First_Cite_for_Perl?">First Cite for 'Perl'?</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

The Oxford English Dictionary folks contacted Larry and asked for the
earliest possible print citation for the word 'Perl'.  (The OED is the
premier dictionary of the English languagem, and seeks to provide
contemporary quotations for every word; that way you can see from
examples how the meaning and usage of each word has changed over its
lifetime.  The Third Edition of the OED is due out in 2007.)
</P>

<P>
The earliest cite located seems to be around 1989; it would be good to
get an earlier cite, which the OED folks call an 'antedating'.  If you
know of an English source that mentions Perl that was printed prior to
1989, please contact Larry.  If you can't reach Larry, contact me.
</P>

<P>
People guess that the best bet for antedatings is probably old 
<CODE>;login:</CODE> magazines.  If you have a pile of these, please take a look.

</P>

<P>

Since last time, Perl 5.6.0 has been released.  As you can see, the
version-numbering scheme has been changed.  If it had not been
changed, this would have been 5.006, or maybe 5.006_00.  
</P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-03/msg02596.html">Announcement for version 5.6.0</a></P>

<P>
In the wake of this, list traffic was very high with various small bug
reports and configuration problems.  It has since quieted down.
</P>

<P>
Another major contributor to the high volume in late March and early
April was a huge amount of whining and recrimination about whether or
not 5.6.0 wasn't any good.  Gosh, p5p at its worst.  Sarathy works
like a dog to get 5.6.0 ready, and then <i>after</i> the release everyone
started whining.
</P>

<P>
On the one hand were people complaining about bugs and how it was
unstable and saying that nobody was going to switch, and there were
some accusations that Sarathy was part of a Microsoft conspiracy to
sabotage Perl.  Blah blah blah.  Then on the other hand were a lot of
people saying that the changes were not significant enough to warrant
a new version number.  
</P>

<P>
(To this last point, I think 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-04/msg00042.html">Tom's reply </a> answers the point most effectively.  The tone is characteristic of
most of the entire discussion.)
</P>

<P>
You would think that at most one set of these assertions could be
plausible; either Microsoft is trying to sabotage Perl by forcing a
premature, unstable release, <i>or</i> the changes are too small to be
worth releasing.  You might think this, but you would be mistaken.
</P>

<P>
Now let's close the book on this particularly disgraceful chapter.
<H3><a name="p5p_to_become_Refereed?">p5p to become Refereed?</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Partly as a result of the long, tedious, and irrelevant flamefest that
took up so much time and energy in March and April, Sarathy proposed
that the list be `refereed'.  This is a little different from
moderation:   Most people's messages go through normally, but if the
referees agree, then messages in a certain thread or from a certain
subscriber have to pass a moderator before they are sent to the list.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-04/msg00574.html">Read the actual proposal before you make up your mind.</a></P>

<P>

The following discussion was gratifyingly free of manifestoes,
ultimatums, accusations, soapboxing, etc.
<blockquote><b>Sarathy:</b> Many good people are not here anymore.  Chip left, but has been brave enough to run a new list in an attempt to rediscover the old perl5-porters as we knew it.  Jarkko disappeared, disgusted by all the name-calling and lurid behavior.  Andy is gone too, thanks to useless arguments, personality  clashes, and FUD-mongering.  We simply cannot afford this. </blockquote> </P>

<P>

A sideline here was that Jarkko expressed a desire that someone else
pick up the Configure pumpkin.  If you want to pick up the Configure
pumpkin, contact Jarkko.

While I wasn't doing reports, Mark Kvale submitted a draft of a

</P>

<P>

Simon Cozens did some work on the promised 'line disciplines' feature
that didn't quite materialize in 5.6.0.  It's a proof-of-concept, and
it's not quite finished.  The idea is that you could associate a Perl
(or XS) function with a filehandle, and then any time you read from

James Jurach reported that when your program is more than 65,535 lines
long, Perl reports the wrong line numbers for errors.  It turns out
that the line numbers are stored in the op node, and are only 16 bits
long, to save space.  (In a 64Kline program, 32-bit line numbers would
consume and extra 128Kb space.)  James submitted a patch that makes
32-bit line numbers a compile-time option.

Benjamin Tilly brought up a number of interesting points.  First, the
error message that 
says 
<CODE>No such array field</CODE> for a pseudohash does not say what the problem field name is.  And
second, that hash performance could degrade more gracefully than it
does at present if, when the linked list in a bucket got too long, it
was replaced with a binary search tree.

<CODE>map</CODE> is quite slow in some cases, even slower than an all-Perl function to

<blockquote><i>`Darn it, who spiked my coffee with water?!'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, it's been two years in the making. Everyone's favourite Swiss
Army Chainsaw is coming up to thirteen years old now, and would be about to
show the world a brand new face for the new millennium if that didn't start
next year instead of this one. If, like me, you remember the day that the
combined might of Malcolm and Sarathy produced the last major release of
Perl, you might be wondering what's happened since then. Allow me, then, to
present to you the wonderful world of 5.6.0!</p>

<h3><a name="Unicode_Perl_goes_internationa">Unicode - Perl goes international!</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`It's kind of weird to read a standards document that has all these
instance of &quot;Oh, by the way, Perl does it this way instead.&quot;'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
The largest change in Perl 5.6 has to be the introduction of UTF-8 Unicode
support. By default, Perl now thinks in terms of Unicode characters instead
of simple bytes; a character can, as the CJK people already know extremely
well, span several bytes. All the relevant built-in functions (<code>length</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and so on) now work on a character-by-character basis instead of byte-by-byte, and strings are represented internally in Unicode.</p>

<p>
Two new pragmata, <em>byte</em> and <em>utf8</em>, have been written to control the Unicode settings; <code>use byte</code> will go back to the old default of reading a byte at a time, whereas <code>use utf8</code> turns on support for UTF8 characters in the source code of a program
itself. The <em>utf8</em> pragma also loads in the character tables, but this is done automatically
by Perl on demand.</p>

<p>
What does it actually mean, then? So things are encoded in Unicode
internally, what does this enable me as a programmer to do? Well, if we
turn on utf8, we can specify string literals in Unicode using the
<code>\x{}</code> notation; just put your character codes in hexadecimal inside the brackets.</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre> $glis =
 &quot;\x{395}\x{3CD}\x{3B1}\x{3B3}\x{3B3}\x{3B5}\x{3BB}\x{3CA}\x{3B1}&quot;;
</pre>
</code>
<p>
You can also reference Unicode characters by their name: the
<em>charnames</em> pragma loads in the list of names, allowing you to then say something like <code>&quot;\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>
Next, if you've got a Unicode editor, you can now, just like Java, use any
Unicode for all your identifiers. This currently needs <code>use utf8</code>
to enable Unicode in your source, but is expected to become standard very
soon; the <em>utf8</em> pragma is attempting to make itself redundant.</p>

<p>
Unicode support for regular expressions is now in, and supports matching
characters based on Unicode properties - you can now match any upper-case
character in any language with <code>\p{IsUpper}</code>. Characters, rather than bytes, are matched by <code>\w</code>, which is a superb thing for the Japanese and other multiple-byte worlds.
Best of all, the new match
<code>\X</code> will snatch any character plus all the attributes (markings, breathings,
and so on) that apply to it.</p>

<p>
Translation is fully supported: whether you mean translation from Unicode
to ordinary 8-bit and back, or upper/lower case translation. For the
former, the <code>tr///</code> operator can be given the UC and CU modifiers to translate from Unicode to
8-bit characters (`chars') and back. As for casifying, <code>uc</code>, <code>lc</code> and friends Do The Right Thing for all upper and lower case characters
specified in the Unicode translation tables.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, there is currently no way to tell Perl that incoming data
from an external file is Unicode; while you can write Unicode data out to a
file, you cannot read Unicode data back in again. While you can work around
this with <code>tr///CU</code>, it's obviously a serious shortcoming, which we hope will be addressed
soon.</p>

<p>
In short, it should be a lot easier for us who have to deal regularly with
multiple-byte alphabets to do so, to manipulate and process data. A new
documentation page, <em>perlunicode</em>, fully documents all the new support.</p>

<h3><a name="Better_Building">Better Building</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote>`I'd be slow to label Configure as &quot;bilge&quot;. that's unnecessarily insulting to all the maintainers of Configure (and metaconfig).
Configure is lovingly crafted, highly knowledgable bilge.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
As usual, Perl now supports more computers than ever before, with the
addition of six new supported platforms; notably, the GNU/Hurd is now
supported, as is the Psion 5.</p>

<p>
Configure finally allows you to look in directories used in old versions of
Perl to search for modules; the split between core modules,
architecture-specific modules and locally added modules is now more
clear-cut. This makes it a lot cleaner and easier to upgrade your Perl
distribution, without having to worry about the modules you've installed
for older versions.</p>

<p>
Perl can now also take advantage of those architectures which use 64 bit
integers (quads) if you use the <code>-Duse64bits</code> flag to Configure, and so you can now do your integer arithmetic with
values up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 instead of a measly 2,147,483,648.</p>

<p>
Similarly, Perl can now process files larger than 2 gigabytes on computers
that support them. Just add <code>-Duselargefiles</code> to your Configure, and off you go.</p>

<p>
Finally, floating point support is enhanced on those computers which
support the `long double' variable type, and we're also starting to see the
beginnings of cross-compiling options appear in Configure.</p>

<p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3><a name="Threading">Threading</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`Here be dragons'</i> - thread.h
</blockquote>
<p>
Perl's threading has been drastically reworked. It's still experimental,
and there's still every expectation that the current implementation may be
thrown out and started again, but Perl now supports two different types of
threads.</p>

<p>
Firstly, we've got the threads that existed in Perl 5.005 - your program
can thread, and each thread can have its own variables and stashes,
controlled with the <em>Thread</em> module as before, and these threads have become slightly more stable - but
we also now have interpreter-based threads.</p>

<p>
In this model, the entire Perl interpreter gets cloned and runs in a
separate thread. At the moment, however, there's no way to create a new
thread from Perl space, so it's not what you want if you're trying to play
with threaded programs, but what it does mean is that platforms such as
Windows that don't support the <code>fork()</code> system call can have an emulated fork by cloning the entire perl
interpreter; each `pseudo-process' then emulates the properties on an
independent process. It's a huge hack, but it works.</p>

<p>
As well as enhanced threading support, we now have support for
`multiplicity'. What this means is that not only can you have two
interpreters in separate threads that have a common ancestry, you can have
completely separate and independent interpreters inside the same process.
Again, there is no interface to this from Perl space; if you want to use
threads in your program, you'll need to turn on the old 5.005 threads;
they're still an experimental feature, so
<em>caveat programmor</em>.</p>

<p>

<h3><a name="Improved_Compiler">Improved Compiler</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`Perl has a long tradition of working around compilers'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
Full kudos is due to Vishal Bhatia and Nick Ing-Simmons for their work on
the Perl compiler; it's come on in leaps and bounds since the last release.
While it's still not ready for prime time, the Perl-to-C compiler now
passes a fair amount of the standard Perl test suite, and can even be used
to compile (some) Tk programs. The `optimised C' compiler is also slightly
more stable, but some problems have been reported.</p>

<p>
The usual provisos apply: your program may not be any faster or smaller
than an uncompiled version. (Quick tests show that a simple program - <em>op/recurse.t</em> in the test suite - is a few milliseconds faster when compiled; it's also a
quarter of a megabyte on this computer and took 70 seconds to compile.)
Compiling a program still means embedding the Perl interpreter inside it -
we're not even dreaming of producing native assembler or C code
translations of a Perl program yet.</p>

<p>
The new <em>perlcompile</em> documentation explains what's going on.

<h3><a name="Version_Tuples">Version Tuples</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>`That is a known bug in 5.00550.  Either an upgrade or a downgrade
will fix it.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
Perl's version numbers have always been a little bizarre; this version
marks a move away from the <code>x.yyy_zz</code> format towards the more standard major-minor-patchlevel format.
Even-numbered minor versions, such as 5.6.0, will be the stable versions,
with the odd-numbered minor versions making up the development stream; now
5.6.0 is released, work will begin on 5.7.0 - this follows the format of
many other open source projects.</p>

<p>
Together with this, a new method of specifying strings has been created - a
literal such as <code>v5.6.0</code>, for example, will be interpreted as a Unicode string made up of three
characters: character 5, character 6 and character 0. This allows one to
compare version numbers using the string comparison operators, and provides
a more readable way of writing long Unicode literals; the string above can
also be specified as

<p>
<code>
<pre>
     $glis = v917.973.945.947.947.949.955.970.947;
</pre>
</code>
<p>
<code>printf</code> and <code>sprintf</code> have now had the <code>v</code> flag added to their format specifications, which allows you to go the other
way: to turn a string into a series of numbers separated by periods - it's
effectively
<code>join &quot;.&quot;, map {ord} split //, $_</code>
</p>


<p>
<code>
<pre>  print  &quot;Perl version: $^V\n&quot;;    # This gives you a messy string!
  printf &quot;Perl version: %vd\n&quot;, $^V;  # Perl version 5.6.0
</pre>
</code>
<p>
This is ideal for any number of things which are specified in such a
format, such as IP addresses:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>     use Socket;
     printf &quot;%vd&quot;, (gethostbyname(&quot;www.perl.com&quot;))[4];
</pre>
</code>
<p>
The new syntax takes a bit of getting used to, it has to be said; most
people won't be using it, but it's a neat trick if you can get your head
around it.</p>

<h3><a name="Lexical_Warnings">Lexical Warnings</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>'Death is not good.  I reject death.  I will stay away from trucks
today.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
The way Perl generates warnings has also been completely revised: as a
replacement for the <code>-w</code> flag and the <code>$^W</code> special variable, the
<code>warnings</code> pragma gives you more flexibility about what warnings you receive and when.</p>

<p>
In terms of <strong>what</strong>, you can now specify warnings by category: there are a bunch of standard
categories, such as 'syntax', 'io', 'void', and modules will be able to
define their own categories. You can also choose to escalate any categories
of warning into a fatal error.</p>

<p>
As for <strong>when</strong>, the pragma is lexically scoped, so you can switch it on and off as you
wish:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre>     use warnings;
</pre>
<p>
<pre>     $a = @a[1];      # This generates a warning.
</pre>
<p>
<pre>     {
          no warnings;
          $a = @a[1];  # This does not.
     }
</pre>
</code>
<p>
See <em>perllexwarn</em> for how to use this from programs and modules.</p>

<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3><a name="Lvaluable_Subroutines">Lvaluable Subroutines</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote></i>'I surely do hope that's a syntax error.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
From the department of bizarre syntax, subroutines can now be legal
lvalues; that means they can be assigned to. Of course, this only works if
they return something assignable, and if they're marked as an lvalue
subroutine. For example, normally, you'd have something like this:</p>

<p>
<code>
<pre> 
     my $a = 10;
     my $b = 20;

     sub mysub {
          if ($_[0] &gt; 0) { return $a } else { return $b }
     }

     print mysub( 2); # Returns 10
     print mysub(-1); # Returns 20
</pre></code>
<p>
What you can now do is this:

<p><code>
<pre>
     sub mysub : lvalue {
          if ($_[0] &gt; 0) { return $a } else { return $b }
     }

     mysub(2)  = 15; # Set $a to 15
     mysub(-1) =  9; # Set $b to 9
</pre></code>
<p>
That is, the function returns not a value, but the variable itself.
</p>
<p>
This is still an experimental feature, and may go away in the future; it's
also not possible to return array or hash variables yet.
</p>
<p>
<hr size="1" noshade>
<h3><a name="Weak_References">Weak References</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>'I might be able to shoehorn a reference count in on top of the
     numeric value by disallowing multiple references on scalars with a
     numeric value, but it wouldn't be as clean.  I do occasionally worry
     about that.'</i> --lwall</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Perl keeps track of when values are in use and when they can be taken out
of commission by counting the number of references that remain to them. The
problem with this was that if you had a variable that was a reference to
itself, like this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>     $a = \$a;
</pre></code>
<p>
the memory would never be freed even if nothing else referred to it, since
it had a valid existing reference.</p>

<p>
What you can now do is weaken a reference; this means that while it is
still a valid reference, it does not add to the reference count. In the
example above, you could weaken <code>$a</code> and it would be freed once it went out of scope. This also means you can
keep a spare copy of a variable or an object but not interfere with its
lifespan.</p>

<p>
To take advantage of this, you need to install the <em>WeakRef</em> package from CPAN, and read the further documentation there.</p>

<h3><a name="POSIX_Character_Classes">POSIX Character Classes</a></h3>
<p>
<blockquote><i>'How do Crays and Alphas handle the POSIX problem?'</i> - lwall</blockquote>

<p>
The Portable Operating Systems Extension (POSIX) standards documents define
a set of named character classes: the class <code>[:upper:]</code>, for example, matches an upper-case character. Of course, Perl supports a
wide range of character classes and can now support matching Unicode
properties too, but it seemed odd that the POSIX standard had not been
implemented, especially since it's familiar to C programmers and used in
standard utilities such as <code>tr</code>. So we implemented it.</p>

<p>
These classes, <code>[:upper:]</code>, <code>[:lower:]</code>, <code>[:digit:]</code> and a bunch of others, actually sit inside ordinary Perl character classes;
as RD Laing said, `now put the brackets in brackets' - to match a
whitespace character, use <code>[[:space:]]</code>. This is equivalent to the Unicode
<code>\p{IsSpace}</code> and the ordinary Perl <code>\s</code>.</p>

<p>
This being Perl, we allow things that POSIX can't do, and you can negate a
POSIX character class with a <code>^</code> before the name. A non-space character can be matched either with <code>[[:^space:]]</code>, <code>\P{IsSpace}</code> or
<code>\S</code>.</p>

<blockquote><i>'Perl will never turn into APL, despite our best efforts.'</i> - lwall
</blockquote>
<p>
Aside from the changes I've just mentioned, there are a myriad of little
things that have been added, improved, and corrected. New documentation has
been written, and older documentation revised; code has been tweaked,
extended, rearranged, and rethought; some small pieces of syntax have been
added or changed; experimental features have been tried, judged and
sentenced.</p>

<p>
While we can't go into all of the less major modifications in the new
version, I'll just pick out some points which may be useful. For the whole
story, you can see the <em>perldelta</em> documentation - for even more of the whole story, read the <em>Changes</em> file in the Perl distribution.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_Binary">Binary Numbers</a></strong><dd>
<p>
As well as being able to specify numbers in decimal (<code>1234</code>), octal (<code>02322</code>) and hexadecimal, (<code>0x4D2</code>) we now have the <code>0b</code> prefix for binary numbers - <code>0b10011010010</code></p>



<p>
While there isn't a <code>bin()</code> function to match <code>hex()</code> and <code>oct()</code>, you can actually make one from the <code>oct()</code> function; <code>oct(&quot;0b1001&quot;)</code>
returns <code>9</code>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_our">our Variables</a></strong><dd>
<p>
Whereas <code>my</code> declares lexical variables, <a href="#item_our">our</a> declares global variables - it's a cleaner and hopefully more intuitive
replacement for
<code>use vars</code>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_File">File Globbing</a></strong><dd>
<p>
The glob operator (<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> and <code>glob</code>) used to be processed by spawning a shell; that was problematic for
operating systems that didn't have a standard shell, and anyway had the
overhead of creating a new process. It's now implemented by calling the
standard <a href="/File/Glob|File/Glob.html">File::Glob|File::Glob</a>
module on demand.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="item_Bug">Bug Fixes</a></strong><dd>
<p>
Most of the bugs, surprises and unpleasantries from 5.005 have been cleared
up; recently there's been quite a blitz on the security of the utilities
that come with Perl, safer handling of temporary files, and tons of work on
debugger, but most of the work of the past year has been clearing up the
issues that you've reported to perl5-porters in the interim. Keep them
coming - it's only by reporting them that they get fixed.</p>

<p>
I'd like to close by commending the great labour of hundreds of porters in
the past year who've worked to bring Perl 5.6 to you, fearlessly led by the
tireless Gurusamy Sarathy, and overseen by the guiding hand of Larry Wall,
and by hoping that this new version will maximise the ease, power, and
above all, enjoyment of your programming.</p>

<p>
May you do Good Magic with Perl... 5.6!
