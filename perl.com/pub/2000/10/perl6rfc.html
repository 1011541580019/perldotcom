<h3><a name="a very brief summary">A Very Brief Summary</a></h3>
<p>Discussion of major changes is pointless in the absence of a
familiarity with internals and implementations.</p>
<p>Discussion of minor changes leads to a whole bunch of minor changes
which don't end up signifying a whole lot.</p>
<p>Discussion was frequently disregarded by proposal authors.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="problems with proposals of major changes">Problems with Proposals of Major Changes</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of the RFC process, I posted a satirical RFC
proposing that cars should get 200 miles per gallon of gasoline.  I
earnestly enumerated all the reasons why this would be a good idea.
Then I finished by saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I confess that I'm not an expert in how cars work.  Nevertheless, I'll
go out on a limb and assert that this will be relatively easy to
implement, with relatively few entangling side-issues.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This characterizes a common problem with many of the RFCs.  
Alan Perlis, a famous wizard, once said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>When someone says ``I want a programming language in which I
need only say what I wish done,'' give him a lollipop.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it may sometimes seem that when we program a computer we are
playing with the purest and most perfectly malleable idea-stuff,
bending it into whatever shape we desire, it isn't really so.  Code is
a very forgiving medium, much easier to work than metal or stone.  But
it still has its limitations.  When someone says that they want hashes
to carry a sorting order, and to always produce items in sorted order,
they have failed to understand those limitations.  Yes, it would be
fabulous to have a hash which preserves order and has fast lookup and
fast insert and delete and which will also fry eggs for you, but we
don't know how to do that.  We have to settle for the things that we
<em>do</em> know how to do.  Many proposals were totally out of line with
reality.  It didn't matter how pretty such a proposal sounds, or even
if Larry accepts it.  If nobody knows how to do it, it is not going to
go in.</p>
<p>Back in August I read the IMPLEMENTATION section of the 166s RFC that
were then extant.</p>
<p>15/166 had no implementation section at all.  14/166 had an extensive
implementation section that neglected to discuss the implementation at
all, and instead discussed the programming language interface.  16/166
contained a very brief remark to the effect that the implementation
would be simple, which might or might not have been true.</p>
<p>34 of 166 RFCs had a very brief section with no substantive discussion
or a protestation of ignorance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>``Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not an engineer!''</p>
<p>``I'll leave that to the internals guys. :-) ''</p>
<p>``I've no real concrete ideas on this, sorry.''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RFC 128 proposed a major extension of subroutine prototypes, and then,
in the implementation section, said only ``Definitely S.E.P.''.
(``Someone Else's Problem'')</p>
<p>I think this flippant attitude to implementation was a big problem in
the RFC process for several reasons.</p>
<p>It leads to a who-will-bell-the-cat syndrome, in which people
propose all sorts of impossible features and then have extensive
discussions about the minutiae of these things that will never be
implemented in any form.  You can waste an awful lot of time
discussing whether you want your skyhooks painted blue or red, and in
the RFC mailing lists, people did exactly this.</p>
<p>It distracts attention from concrete implementation discussion about
the real possible tradeoffs.  In my opinion, it was not very smart to
start a <code>perl6-internals</code> list so soon, because that suggested that
the <em>other</em> lists were <em>not</em> for discussion of internals.  As a
result, a lot of the discussion that went on on the
<code>perl6-language-*</code> lists bore no apparent relation to any known
universe.  One way to fix this might have been to require every
<code>language</code> list to have at least one liaison with the <code>internals</code>
list, someone who had actually done some implementation work and had
at least a vague sense of what was possible.</p>
<p>Finally, on a personal note, I found this flippancy annoying.  There
are a lot of people around who do have some understanding of the Perl
internals.  An RFC author who knows that he does not understand the
internals should not have a lot of trouble finding someone to consult
with, to ask basic questions like ``Do you think this could be made to
work?''  As regex group chair, I offered more than once to hook up RFC
authors with experienced Perl developers.  RFC authors did not bother
to do this themselves, preferring to write ``S.E.P.'' and ``I have no
idea how difficult this would be to implement'' and ``Dunno''.  We could
have done better here, but we were too lazy to bother.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="problems with proposals of minor changes">Problems with Proposals of Minor Changes</a></h3>
<p>
<h4><a name="translation issues ignored or disregarded">Translation Issues Ignored or Disregarded</a></h4>
<p>Translation issues were frequently ignored.  Larry has promised that
80% of Perl 5 programs would be translatable to Perl 6 with 100%
compatibility, and 95% with 95% compatibility.  Several proposals were
advanced which would have changed Perl so as to render many programs
essentially untranslatable.  If the authors considered such programs
to be in the missing 5%, they never said so.</p>
<p>Even when the translation issues were not entirely ignored, they were
almost invariably incomplete.  For example, RFC 74 proposed a simple
change: Rename <code>import</code> and <code>unimport</code> to be <code>IMPORT</code> and
<code>UNIMPORT</code>, to make them consistent with the other all-capitals
subroutine names that are reserved to Perl.  It's not clear what the
benefit of this is, since as far as I know nobody has ever reported
that they tried to write an <code>import</code> subroutine and then were bitten
by the special meaning that Perl attaches to this name, but let's
ignore this and suppose that the change is actually useful.</p>
<p>The MIGRATION section of this RFC says, in full:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Perl5 -&gt; Perl6 translator should provide a <code>import</code> alias for the
<code>IMPORT</code> routine to ease migration.  Likewise for <code>unimport</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not really clear what that means, unless you suppose that the
author got it backwards.  A Perl 5 module being translated already has
an <code>import</code> routine, so it does not need an <code>import</code> alias.
Instead, it needs an <code>IMPORT</code> alias that points at <code>import</code>, which
it already has.  Then when it is run under perl6, Perl will try to
call the <code>IMPORT</code> routine, and, because of the alias, it will get the
<code>import</code> routine that is actually there.</p>
<p>Now, what if this perl5 module already has an <code>IMPORT</code> subroutine
also?  Then you can't make <code>IMPORT</code> an alias for <code>import</code> because
you must clobber the real <code>IMPORT</code> to do so.  Maybe you can rename
the original <code>IMPORT</code> and call it <code>_perl5_IMPORT</code>.  Now you have
broken the following code:</p>
<pre>
        $x = 'IMPORT';
        &amp;$x(...);</pre>
<p>because now the code calls <code>import</code> instead of the thing you now call
<code>_perl5_IMPORT</code>.  It's easy to construct many cases that are
similarly untranslatable.</p>
<p>None of these cases are likely to be common.  That is not the point.
The point is that the author apparently didn't give any thought to
whether they were common or not; it seems that he didn't get that far.
Lest anyone think that I'm picking on this author in particular (and
I'm really not, because the problem was nearly universal) I'll just
point out that a well-known Perl expert had the same problem in RFC
271.  As I said in email to this person, the rule of thumb for the
MIGRATION ISSUES section is that 'None' is <em>always</em> the wrong answer.</p>
<p>
<h4><a name="an anecdote about translation issues">An Anecdote About Translation Issues</a></h4>
<p>Here's a related issue, which is somewhat involved, but which I think
perfectly demonstrates the unrealistic attitudes and poor
understanding of translation issues and Larry's compatibility
promises.</p>
<p>Perl 5 has an <code>eval</code> function which takes a
string argument, compiles the string as Perl code, and executes it.  I
pointed out that if you want a Perl 5 program to have the same
behavior after it is translated, <code>eval</code>'ed code will have to be
executed with Perl 5 semantics, not Perl 6 semantics.  Presumably the
Perl 6 <code>eval</code> will interpret its argument as a Perl 6 program, not a
Perl 5 program.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>Memoize</code> module constructs an anonymous subroutine
like this:</p>
<pre>
    my $wrapper = eval &quot;sub $proto { unshift \@_, qq{$cref}; 
                                     goto &amp;_memoizer; }&quot;;</pre>
<p>Suppose hypothetically that the <code>unshift</code> function has been eliminated
from Perl 6, and that Perl 5 programs that use <code>unshift</code> are
translated so that</p>
<pre>
        unshift @array, LIST</pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre>
        splice @array, 0, 0, LIST</pre>
<p>instead.  Suppose that <code>Memoize.pm</code> has been translated similarly,
but the <code>unshift</code> in the statement above cannot be translated because
it is part of a string.  If <code>Memoize.pm</code> is going to continue
working, the <code>unshift</code> in the string above will need to be
interpreted as a Perl 5 <code>unshift</code> (which modifies an array) instead
of as a Perl 6 <code>unshift</code> (which generates a compile-time error.)</p>
<p>The easy solution to this is that when the translator sees <code>eval</code> in
a Perl 5 program, it should not translate it to <code>eval</code>, but instead
to <code>perl5_eval</code>.  <code>perl5_eval</code> would be a subroutine that would call
the Perl5-to-Perl6 translator on the argument string, and then the
built-in (Perl 6) <code>eval</code> function on the result.</p>
<p>A number of people objected to this, and see if you can guess why:
Performance!</p>
<p>I found this incredible.  Apparently these people all come from the
planet where it is more important for the program to finish as quickly
as possible than for it to do what it was intended to do.</p>
<p>
<h4><a name="tunnel vision">Tunnel Vision</a></h4>
<p>Probably the largest and most general problem with the proposals
themselves was a lack of overall focus in the ideas put forward.  Here
is a summary of a typical RFC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feature XYZ of Perl has always bothered me.  I do task xyzpdq all the
time and XYZ is not quite right for it; I have to use two lines of
code instead of only one.  So I propose that XYZ change to XY'Z
instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RFCs 148 and 272 are a really excellent example of this.  They propose
two versions of the same thing, each author having apparently solved
his little piece of the problem without considering that the Right
Thing is to aim for a little more generality.  RFC 262 is also a good
example, and there are many, many others.</p>
<p>Now, fixing minor problems with feature XYZ, whatever it is, is not
necessarily a bad idea.  The problem is that so many of the solutions
for these problems were so out of proportion to the size of the
problem that they were trying to solve.  Usually the solution was
abetted by some syntactic enormity.</p>
<p>The subsequent discussions would usually discover weird cases of
tunnel vision.  One might say to the author that the solution they
proposed seemed too heavyweight to suit the problem, like squashing a
mosquito with a sledgehammer.  But often the proponent wouldn't be
able to see that, because for them, this was an unusually annoying
mosquito.  People would point out that with a few changes, the
proposal could also be extended to cover a slightly different task,
xyz'pdq, also, and the proponent would sometimes reply that they
doesn't consider that to be an important problem to solve.</p>
<p>It's all right to be so short-sighted when you're designing software
for yourself, but when you design a language that will be used by
thousands or millions of people, you have to have more economy.  Every
feature has a cost in implementation and maintenance and
documentation and education, so the language designer has to make
every feature count.  If a feature isn't widely useful to many people
for many different kinds of tasks, it has negative value.  In the
limit, to accomplish all the things that people want from a language,
unless most of your features are powerful and flexible, you have to
include so very many of them that the language becomes an impossible
morass.  (Of course, there is another theory which states that this
has already happened.)</p>
<p>This came as no surprise to me.
I maintain the <code>Memoize</code> module, which is fairly popular.
People would frequently send me mail asking me to add a certain
feature, such as timed expiration of cached data.  I would reply that
I didn't want to do that, because it would slow down the module for
everyone, and it would not help the next time I got a similar but
slightly different request, such as a request for data that expires
when it has been used a fixed number of times.  The response was
invariably along the lines of ``But what would anyone want to do that
for?''  And then the following week I would get mail from someone else
asking for expiration of data after it had been used a fixed number of
times, and I would say that I didn't want to put this in because it
wouldn't help people with the problem of timed expiration <em>and the
response would be exactly the same</em>.  A module author must be good at
foreseeing this sort of thing, and good at finding the best compromise
solution for everyone's problems, not just the butt-pimple of the
week.  A language designer must be even better at doing this, because
many, many people will be stuck with the language for years.  Many of
the people producing RFCs were really, really bad at it.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="miscellaneous problems">Miscellaneous Problems</a></h3>
<p>
<h4><a name="lack of familiarity with prior art">Lack of Familiarity with Prior Art</a></h4>
<p>Many of the people proposing features had apparently never worked in
any language other than Perl.  Many features were proposed that had
been tried in other language and found deficient in one way or
another.  (For example, the Ruby language has a feature similar to that proposed in RFC 162.)  Of course, not everyone knows a lot of other languages, and
one has to expect that.
It wouldn't have been so bad if the proponents had been
more willing to revise their ideas in light of the evidence.</p>


<p>Worse, many of the people proposing new features appeared not to be
familiar with <em>Perl</em>.  RFC 105 proposed a change that had already
been applied to Perl 5.6.  RFC 158 proposed semantics for <code>$&amp;</code> that
had already been introduced in Perl <em>5.000</em>.</p>
<p>
<h4><a name="too much syntax">Too Much Syntax</a></h4>
<p>Too many of the proposals focused on trivial syntactic issues.  
This isn't to suggest that all the syntactic RFCs were trivial.  I
particularly appreciated RFC 9's heroic attempt to solve the reference
syntax mess.</p>
<p>An outstanding example of this type of RFC: The author of RFC 274
apparently didn't like the <code>/${foo}bar/</code> syntax for separating a
variable interpolation from a literal string in a regex, because he
proposed a new syntax, <code>/$foo(?)bar/</code>.  Wonderful, because then when
Perl 7 comes along we can have an RFC that complains that
<code>&quot;${foo}bar&quot;</code> works in double-quoted strings but <code>&quot;$foo(?)bar&quot;</code> does
not, points out that beginners are frequently confused by this
exception, and proposes to fix it by making <code>&quot;(?)&quot;</code> special in
double-quoted strings as well.</p>
<p>This also stands out as a particularly bad example of the problem of
the previous section, in which the author is apparently unfamiliar
with Perl.  Why?  Because the syntaxes <code>/$foo(?:)bar/</code> and
<code>/$foo(?=)bar/</code> both work today and do what RFC 274 wanted to do, at
the cost of one extra character.  (This part of the proposal was later
withdrawn.)</p>
<p>
<h4><a name="working group chairs useless">Working Group Chairs Useless</a></h4>
<p>Maybe 'regex language working group chair' is a good thing to put on
your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but I don't think I'll be doing that
soon, because when you put something like that on your
r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you always run the risk that an interviewer
will ask what it actually means, and if that happened to me I would
have to say that I didn't know.  I asked on the <code>perl6-meta</code> list
what the working group chair's duties were, and it turned out that nobody
else knew, either.</p>
<p>Working group chairs are an interesting idea.  Some effort was made to
chose experienced people to fill the positions.  This effort was
wasted because there was nothing for these people to do once they were
appointed.  They participated in the discussions, which was valuable,
but calling them 'working group chairs' did not add anything.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="overall problems">Overall Problems</a></h3>
<p>
<h4><a name="discussion was of unnecessarily low quality">Discussion was of Unnecessarily Low Quality</a></h4>
<p>The biggest problem with the discussion process was that it was
essentially pointless, except perhaps insofar as it may have amused a
lot of people for a few weeks.  What I mean by 'pointless' is that I
think the same outcome would have been achieved more quickly and less
wastefully by having everyone mail their proposals directly to Larry.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion that I saw was of poor quality because of lack
of familiarity with other languages, with Perl, with basic data
structures, and so forth.</p>
<p>But I should not complain too much about this because many
ill-informed people were still trying in good faith to have a
reasonable discussion of the issues involved.  That is all we can
really ask for.  Much worse offenses were committed regularly.</p>
<p>I got really tired of seeing people's suggestions answered with
'Blecch'.  Even the silliest proposal does not deserve to be answered
with 'Blecch'.  No matter how persuasive or pleasing to the ear, it's
hard to see 'Blecch' as anything except a crutch for someone who's too
lazy to think of a serious technical criticism.</p>
<p>The RFC author's counterpart of this tactic was to describe their own
proposal as 'more intuitive' and 'elegant' and everything else as
'counter-intuitive' and 'ugly'.  'Elegant' appears to be RFCese for 'I
don't have any concrete reason for believing that this would be
better, but I like it anyway.'</p>
<p>Several times I saw people respond to technical criticism of their
proposals by saying something like ``It is just a proposal'' or ``It is
only a request for comments''.  Perhaps I am reading too much into it,
but that sounds to me like an RFC author who is becoming defensive,
and who is not going to listen to anyone else's advice.</p>
<p>One pleasant surprise is that the RFCs were mostly free of references
to the 'beginners'; I only wish it had been as rare in the following
discussion.  One exasperated poster said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>``Beginners are confused by X'' is a decent bolstering argument
as to why X should be changed, but it's a lousy primary
argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A final bright point: I don't think Hitler was invoked at any point in
the discussion.</p>
<p>
<h4><a name="too much criticism and discussion was ignored by rfc authors">Too Much Criticism and Discussion was Ignored by RFC Authors</a></h4>
<p>Here's probably the most serious problem of the whole discussion
process: Much of the criticism that wasn't low-quality was ignored
anyway; it was not even incorporated into subsequent revisions of the
RFCs.  And why should it have been?  No RFC proponent stood to derive
any benefit from incorporating criticism, or even reading it.</p>
<p>Suppose you had a nifty idea for Perl 6, and you wrote an RFC.  Then
three people pointed out problems with your proposal.  You might
withdraw the RFC, or try to fix the problem, and a few people did
actually do these things.  But most people did not, or tried for a
while and then stopped.  Why bother?  There was no point to
withdrawing an RFC, because if you left it in, Larry might accept it
anyway.  Kill 'em all and Larry sort 'em out!</p>
<p>As a thought experiment, let's try to give the working group chairs
some meaning by giving them the power to order the withdrawal of a
proposal.  Now the chair can tell a recalcitrant proposer that their
precious RFC will be withdrawn if they don't update it, or if they
don't answer the objections that were raised, or if they don't do some
research into feasible implementations.  Very good.  The proposal is
forcibly withdrawn?  So what?  It is still on the web site.  Larry
will probably look at it anyway, whether or not it is labeled
'withdrawn'.</p>
<p>So we ended up with 360 RFCs, some contradictory, some overlapping,
just what you would expect to come out of a group of several hundred
people who had their fingers stuck in their ears shouting LA LA LA I
CAN'T HEAR YOU.</p>
<p>

<h3><a name="bottom line">Bottom Line</a></h3>
<p>I almost didn't write this article, for several reasons: I didn't have
anything good to say about the process, and I didn't have much
constructive advice to offer either.  I was afraid that it wouldn't be
useful without examples, but I didn't want to have to select examples
because I didn't want people to feel like I was picking on them.</p>
<p>However, my discussions with other people who had been involved in the
process revealed that many other people had been troubled by the same
problems that I had.  They seemed to harbor the same
doubts that I did about whether anything useful was being
accomplished, and sometimes asked me what I thought.</p>
<p>I always said (with considerable regret) that I did not think it was
useful, but that Larry might yet prove me wrong and salvage something
worthwhile from the whole mess.  Larry's past track record at figuring
out what Perl should be like has been fabulous, and I trust his
judgment.  If anyone is well-qualified to distill something of value
from the 360 RFCs and ensuing discussion, it is Larry Wall.</p>
<p>That is the other reason to skip writing the article: My feelings
about the usefulness of the process are ultimately unimportant.  If
Larry feels that the exercise was worthwhile and produced useful
material for him to sort through, then it was a success, no matter how
annoying it was to me or anyone else.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we might one day do it all over again for Perl 7.  I
would like to think that if that day comes we would be able to serve
Larry a little better than we did this time.</p>
