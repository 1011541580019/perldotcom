<!-- Last Chance to Support Damian Conway -->

<p>$16,500 pledged, another $11,000 needed to liberate Damian Conway.

<p>As reported earlier, the <a href="http://www.yetanother.org/">Yet Another
Society</a> (YAS) is putting together a grant to Monash University,
Australia.  The grant will fund Damian Conway's full-time work on
Perl for a year.  YAS founder Kevin Lenzo said, "The response from
the Perl community has been just overwhelming."</p>

<p>Damian Conway, the author of many award-winning Perl Conference papers
as well as the <code>Quantum::Superpositions</code> and <code>Parse::RecDescent</code> modules,
is a professor in Monash's Computer Science department.  His day job
involves administrating a degree course, teaching undergraduates, and
assisting postgraduate students with research. It doesn't include Perl.
The Perl work he has done so far has been in his spare time, wedged
around his &gt;60-hour Monash weeks.<p>


The wider Perl community has pledged over US$16,000 so far.  That only
US$11,000 to be raised before a matching pledge from <A 
HREF="http://www.blackstar.co.uk/">BlackStar</A>, a UK-based
video-retail company, takes it up to the US$55,000 needed. Kevin
Lenzo said "Blackstar stepped up quite early to help
out.  Their business benefits from Perl in innumerable ways, and
they're really being good citizens by contibuting back this way, in a
real and substantial way that will help everyone."<p>

Unlike the previous kinds of corporate sponsorship of Perl developers,
where O'Reilly (which runs this site) employs Larry Wall and
ActiveState employed Gurusamy Sarathy (the last pumpking), Damian
would merely be funded to work on Perl.  Said Damian, "I'd be working
on projects of my own devising: Perl modules, the development of
perl6, and making presentations to any Perl Monger groups I pass on my
travels, with no other demands on my time."<p>

However, time is running out.  Damian must let Monash know by the end
of this week whether he'll be teaching next year.  Says Kevin Lenzo,
"This is a new kind of community patronage -- community-funded open
source development.  If this works well, we may have more ability to
fund people for core work on Perl and other projects."<p>

To pledge money towards the grant, go to <A

Any sized pledge is accepted.  YAS has applied for non-profit status
with the IRS, so contributions may be tax-deductible. <p.
