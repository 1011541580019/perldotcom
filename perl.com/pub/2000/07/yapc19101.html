<P>Last month Yet Another Perl Conference 19100 was held at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I promised a
conference report when I got back, but once again found that I
couldn't really write it myself, because I had been a speaker and so
had missed a lot of the things that went on outside of my own events.</P>
<P>While trying to decide whom to get to write the report instead, I
realized that I was tired of conference reports written by one person.
Instead, I followed the pattern of one of the conference's big
successes, the Lightning Talks, and asked about twenty people to each
contribute a very short report on one or two aspects of the
conference.</P>
<P>The reports follow.  For more information about YAPC, visit
<A HREF="http://www.yapc.org/.">http://www.yapc.org/.</A>  Also note that the first YAPC::Europe
conference is coming up in London in September.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="schuyler d. erle">Schuyler D. Erle</A></H3>
<P>The first big highlight was probably Larry Wall's opening speech on
Bunyan's <EM>The Pilgrim's Progress</EM> and the development of perl, but I
found the talk's concluding Q&amp;A portion really unforgettable. Someone
asked Larry what the first thing was that he would go back and change
about perl, given the chance. His answer was succinct: The return
value of <CODE>system()</CODE>. `"Obviously," he announced, "If you want to
succeed, be true."</P>
<P>Friday's big excitement was mjd's Lightning Talks, a sort of
Conference Proceedings for the Attention Span Impaired. A lot of
people turned out to see the five-minute talks, most of which were
really well delivered. Amazingly, all of the speakers kept to their
allotted time, as marked by Dominus with a gong he seemed to have
mysteriously acquired for that purpose. The highlights of the Talks
were universally accorded to be Nat Torkington's twin discourses on "A
Day in the Life of p5p" and "What is it with those Python fucks,
anyway?", the latter of which was thoroughly tongue-in-cheek,
absolutely hilarious, and it's too damn bad for you if you missed it
because Nat has, apparently in the interests of peace, refused to make the
text of the speech public. "Of course our wheel is square. It's easier
to measure that way."</P>
<P>But, as always, the best part about YAPC is the people. After Friday's
proceedings, I, with every intention of going down to Forbes Av. and
getting too drunk to walk back to the dorms, instead happened upon
what apparently started out as an idle chat with Larry and Sean Burke
and mjd and a few others, and became this mad informal panel
discussion in the lounge that started with the genus of shellfish the
Phoenician used for dye and somehow ended up moving from there to the
philology of Lisp and Cobol to the decipherment of the <EM>Codex
Seraphinianus</EM> and beyond, digressing continually for all kinds of
other esoteric insanity. I mostly sat and listened, utterly
fascinated. I never did make it out to the bars. I swear, the perl
community is a bright lot, and, boy, YAPC is a great place to get a
healthy dose of humility. Thank God it only happens once a year.</P>
<P>[ Details about the Lightning Talks are available at
<A HREF="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html</A> --D. ]</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="avi">Avi</A></H3>
<P>For me, YAPC started around 9:00 on Wednesday, June 22nd.  I showed up
a bit too late to catch Kevin Lenzo's introductory talk, but just in
time to catch Mark-Jason Dominus' talk on strong typing, an
interesting talk about the pitfalls and triumphs of typing systems in
various programming languages.  Mr. Dominus is an incredible speaker,
and even while he was clearly quite exhausted, the talk was very
interesting.</P>
<P>After this talk, I hopped over the Randal Schwartz's "Learning Perl"
room for about an hour.  Now I can't say how good this talk is for
perl beginners, not having been one myself for quite a while, but I
always like to go see Randal speak for at least a little while at
these conferences.  Every time I go, I learn something new about perl
that I just hadn't noticed before.  For example, at YAPC I learned
about the return value of <CODE>print</CODE> and the behaviour of <CODE>reverse(@)</CODE>.
However, I can only last about an hour before the dreadful jokes and
auctioneer-style patter start to really get to me.</P>
<P>After lunch I returned to the Dominus room where the famed "Wizards"
talk was getting under way.  In just under an hour and a half, I
learned an immense amount about globs, knobs, references and other
sundries that go on under the cover of the stash.  Unfortunately,
shortly after the final break for the day had begun, I was again
overcome by anxiety and had to leave.  I spent the rest of YAPC at
home and at work, but I hear it was also very cool.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="gene boggs: day 2">Gene Boggs: Day 2</A></H3>
<P>Woke up and made for the shower to catch Larry Wall's opening
talk, stopping only to smile as Larry and backpack walked silently by.</P>
<P>Got to the auditorium (after wolfing down excellent catered YAPC 
breakfast of fresh fruit and bagels), sat by mjd, and listened to Larry  
speak through the allegorical adventures of Christian in the book,  
"Pilgrims Progress."</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sean m. burke">Sean M. Burke</A></H3>
<P>Listening to a Damian Conway talk (whether about OOP, or about quantum
programming) is like going to an old-time Grateful Dead show: it goes
on hours longer than expected, but by even halfway through you're
tripping too hard to care.</P>
<P>John Orwant's talk discussed concepts of copyright by pointing out
design features of things (an ashtray, an ice bucket, a lamp!) that he
snuck out of his hotel room -- using stolen property to explain
intellectual property.</P>
<P>As to the post-talk festivities: There's not many conferences you can
go to where people, once a bit drunk, will declare how delicious the
word "ontogenesis" is, swap tips on where to get a copy of the <EM>Codex
Seraphinianus</EM>, and then go make fun of whatever's on ESPN.</P>

<P>YAPC was an interesting mix of brilliant, delightful, vulgar, pompous,
engaging, boring, and fun people.  I say people, because the people
eclipsed the event proper.  When I think about what talks I went to
see and why, I realize that I went to see a certain person speak and
not to see a certain topic elaborated.  So what we had was essentially
a huge multi-day all-night technical bull-session with a wide variety
of people, led by the cream of the crop.  Well, frankly, what could be
more fun for a crowd of geeks?</P>
<P>Yes, fun.  Sure, I justified all my expenses as training costs to my
employer, but at the end of the day we had a lot of fun.  Certainly
some great things were learned, but mostly contact was made with
plenty of smart people and we had a good time doing it.  What I
remember most vividly, for example, are events that happened far from
the conference schedule:</P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>
Discussing the autism and language with Larry Wall, Sean Burke, and
Mark-Jason Dominus at some terrible hour in the crossroads of the
dormitory.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Having my room invaded by several luminaries for an impromptu
discussion on Perl, the universe, and Space Ghost at 3am while trying
to prepare slides for my talk the next day.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Being discretely offered computing services in the wee hours by folks
who should know better but feel that getting Larry on-line at 4am is
more important than the rules.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Being offered long distance cell phone time from a large number of
caring #perl folks so that I could call home and talk to the
sweetheart we had to leave behind for the week.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Throwing a frisbee on the lawn with Perl people when it was so dark
that the disk could not be seen until it was 2 meters from your face.
<P></P></DL>
<P>I'd chew off my own leg before missing the next one.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="lisa nyman: report from a firsttime presenter">Lisa Nyman:  Report from a First-time Presenter</A></H3>
<P>While I have presented papers at other conferences in the past, I have
always been nervous about presenting at a Perl conference. I thought
no one would find my work interesting or innovative.  I was wrong.</P>
<P>YAPC was the ideal venue to discuss my latest project (the Census 2000
Internet Form) and all the open source issues related to its
development.  Being a speaker opened up a lot of conversations with
people who, in their search for advocacy support, were curious about
my agency's work with Perl and open source. Someone asked me
optimistically "But is open source part of your agency's <EM>strategic
plan?</EM>"  Well, it isn't, but that hasn't stopped us from depending on
it.</P>
<P>So gather your ideas and start putting together your presentations for
next year.  Use your local PerlMongers meetings as a proving ground.
Take advantage of the small crowds and congenial atmosphere of YAPC to
get your feet wet in the waters of the Perl conference circuit.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="clinton pierce">Clinton Pierce</A></H3>
<P>Initially, I had two goals for YAPC.  The first was to get in touch
with some of the Perl Culture that I've been missing out on.  Second
was to learn some things about Perl that I really didn't know.</P>
<P>I attended Dick Hardt's "Programming for the People," and the talk
itself wasn't the part I found fascinating -- it was the audience.
The surprising thing was how heavily they (and Activestate!) rely on
the Perl Culture as a backbone.  They want someone like Activestate to
give them polished tools.  They need the gurus and "heavies" of the
Perl culture, if for nothing else to tell them where to go.  For them,
it's not important that Perl is a swiss army chainsaw -- they're
interested in the service department, sales staff, and the user
groups.  They can't get this level of support from any other toolset.
And I agree completely.</P>
<P>A lot of the new Perl I learned wasn't perl.  First was MJD's talk on
why a strongly typed Perl doesn't have to suck.  A lot of the talk was
about ML!  It may seem out of place, but learning just enough ML to
really see the benefits of strong typing kind of makes me hope that
Perl 6 has some of that as an option.  (I feel so dirty!)  The JAPH
talk that I went to wasn't really Perl either.  It was terribly
perverse laughing at how Perl can be molded to even the most twisted
of minds (Hi Abigail!).  If you've never been able to decode a JAPH
before, find Abigail's slides on the Web and learn frightening things
about the language you THOUGHT you knew.</P>
<P>[Abigail's JAPH talk slides are available at
<A HREF="http://ucan.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/Talks/Japhs/">http://ucan.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/Talks/Japhs/</A>  --D.]</P>

<H3><A NAME="nathan torkington">Nathan Torkington</A></H3>
<P>Getting to YAPC was miserable.  United screwed me over a ticket
change, so I had to pay $700 at the last minute for tickets on
Vanguard.  They ran late, I missed my bus on the return trip, and so
on.  Bah.</P>
<P>I had a great time at the conference proper, oh yes.  I got to see all
my friends, catch some great talks, and have some fun giving talks.</P>
<P>Friends.  Standout evening: getting toasted at the church brewpub
(http://www.churchbrew.com/) on Saturday night.  Other highlights:
discussing the philosophy of OO and teaching OO with Damian Conway and
Joseph Hall; sitting around the hotel bar in the evenings with Jarkko
Hietaniemi, Elaine Ashton, Sean Burke, Jon Orwant, and Mik Firestone,
yammering about everything until the wee hours; Mik's killer hooch
(home-aged lemon and vodka); Elaine's whiskey; the trip to Falling
Water on Saturday with Jon and Damian.</P>
<P>Other people's talks.  Damian's Quantum Superpositions talk was
stellar, even if it did lead to tedious repetition of the phrase "in
constant time" afterward.  Jon's Apocalypse talk was a fine
continuation from last year's.  Adam Turoff's Quizzo was a lot of fun
(I'm not just saying that because our fabulous team placed) and I hope
we see it again next year.  The lightning talks were cosmic and I
liked them so much I'm going to beg Mark-Jason to do them next year at
TPC.</P>
<P>My talks.  My three hour tutorial on "The Seven Stages of a Perl
Programmer," based on a great post Tom Christiansen made to
perl5-porters in 1997 was fun.  I gave two 20-minute talks on advocacy
and the uniqueness of Perl, while my head spun from cold medicine.
And I gave two five-minute lightning talks, one satirizing the
perl5-porters mailing list, and the other a Dennis Miller-style rant
against the over-zealous Python advocacy I've seen lately.  Notes for
all my talks, except the Python rant, are at
<A HREF="http://prometheus.frii.com/~gnat/yapc/">http://prometheus.frii.com/~gnat/yapc/</A>.</P>
<P>Summary: a blast.  Can't wait to do it again.  Great job, Kevin!</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="adam turoff">Adam Turoff</A></H3>
<P>While at YAPC this year, I would look around every so often and wonder
if the conference program was an elaborate ruse to get nearly 400
Perl programmers together to sit and chat.</P>
<P>One discussion I had on the way to dinner was about what's broken with
CPAN.  One of the points mentioned was that Perl in general and CPAN
in particular does not accept multiple competing implementations of
modules.  On the one hand, it sounds like a violation of TMTOWTDI, but
on the other hand, CPAN symbolizes The Perl Way.  Playing with this
idea in detail, I began to realize that there's a zeroth law that
supercedes TMTOWTDI: Perl encourages sharing and collaboration over
standardization and competition.</P>
<P>Over another chat, I met Ranga Nathan, a Perl programmer who spends a
lot of time with COBOL code.  We talked about a decent number of
issues, and found an example of a point Nat Torkington made during one
of his talks.  When Perl doesn't go whole-hog into OOP or CORBA, it
could be a sign that these bloated technologies are really unnecessary
for solving real-world problems.  People like Ranga who are coming out
of the glass house of mainframes are coming into Perl and skipping
pass objects and multithreading, and finding themselves happy and
productive using Perl, ignoring all of the hype that comes with other
languages.</P>
<H3><A NAME="markjason dominus">Mark-Jason Dominus</A></H3>
<P>I don't really remember much of what happened at YAPC.  I took the
redeye in from San Diego and arrived at about 6 AM the morning that
the conference began.  Kevin told me that Joe had been delayed, and
asked if I would fill in for him, and for some reason I said "yes."  I
suppose part of the reason is that I don't get very many opportunities
to give my talk on how <EM>Strong Typing Doesn't Have to Suck</EM>.  I think
the talk went really well, because it requires that I jump up and down
and froth at the mouth and scream about how awful the type checking in
Pascal is, and it turns out that it's a lot easier to do that when
I've just come in on the redeye from San Diego.</P>
<P>The rest of the conference was a big blur for me.  I gave twelve hours
of talks in two days, and then I made a midnight excursion with
Abigail to obtain the gong for the Lightning Talks.  The next day I
was signed up for paintball, and as we were waiting for people to
finish assembling so we could leave, I suddenly realized that it just
wasn't going to happen, and I got my money back.</P>
<P>One of the paintballers took this picture just before they left:</p>
