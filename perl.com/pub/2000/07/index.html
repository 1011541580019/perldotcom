<!-- <a name="the effort to write perl 6 has begun in earnest">"The Effort to Write Perl 6 Has Begun In Earnest"</a> -->
<p>Last Monday, nobody knew that anything unusual was about to happen.
On Tuesday, the Perl 6 project started.  On Wednesday, Larry announced
it at his "State of the Onion" address at the Perl conference.</p>
<p>Yes, it all really did happen that fast.</p>
<p>
<!-- <a name="before">Before</a> -->
<p>Several problems have seemed to beset Perl in the past year:</p>
<p>Infighting on p5p, the main Perl developers' list, seemed out of
control for a while, and, although the problems seem to have been
solved by the addition of refereeing (See
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-04/msg00574.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-04/msg00574.html</a>
for details), several important developers had quit the list already.</p>
<p>But not a lot seems to have happened to Perl in the last year.
The last really
interesting Perl development was probably POE, which won the "Best New
Module" award at <em>last</em> year's Perl conference. 
There was a Perl 5.6 release, but most of the changes were not
user-visible.  There was better support for threads (including support
for <code>fork()</code> on Windows systems, which is very impressive) and
Unicode.  But it's hard to get excited about this, and it was really
hard to put in, and incomplete.</p>
<p>Perl development was stuck.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="stuck how">Stuck How?</a></h2>
<p>There are two big problems with Perl 5.</p>
<p>First, the internals are extremely convoluted.  It's <em>hard</em> to hack
on Perl's internals.  There's a lot of accumulated cruft, and Perl 5
has reached that stage of maturity in which it's difficult to make a
change or fix a bug without introducing some new bug.  The excellent
test suite prevents the new bugs from getting into the release, of
course, but it also prevents the new feature from getting into the
release.</p>
<p>The addition of threads, the compiler, bytecode generation, and
Unicode support is still incomplete, because none of those things were
designed into Perl 5; they are all being bolted on afterwards, and it
shows.</p>
<p>The other big problem is thirteen years of backward compatibility
history.  The porters might like to rationalize the syntax a little,
or clean up Perl's semantics, but that might break old code, and Perl
is committed to not breaking old code.  We can't add a new built-in function because it might break old code.  It's
extremely difficult to remove even the most bizarre and little-used
old features, because it might break old code.  Every few months,
someone suggests replacing Perl's garbage collector with a more modern
one, but there are always objections from people who have written code
that assumes that the garbage collector will always be reference-count
based and that it can control when objects will be destructed.</p>
<p>Technically, there's not very much "wiggle room" in the source code,
because the internals are so convoluted and difficult.  And there's
not much "wiggle room" in the language itself, because of the need to
support ten-year-old Perl 2 code.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="tuesday">Tuesday</a></h2>
<p>I had to miss the Tuesday meetings, because I was teaching classes.
So this part of the report is hearsay.</p>
<p>A meeting of the Perl 5 Porters was scheduled to take place in the
afternoon.  
In the morning, Chip Salzenberg held a pre-meeting for discussion of
"constitutional issues," to change the way Perl development was run.
But after a while, according to Larry, "Jon Orwant ... pointed out
that it was going to be useless to invent a new constitution if everyone
was just going to say, 'Ho, hum.'"
Jon suggested that Perl try
to go in a new direction, and do something new and big; he used
Napster as an example of a new, big idea.
This
was the catalyst for the discussion to go in a new direction.  At the
end of the the morning, the
decision was made to start working on Perl 6.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="what about perl 6">What About Perl 6?</a></h2>
<p>Perl 6 will be a complete rewrite of Perl, starting from scratch.  The
internals will be redesigned.  Threading, Unicode, and reliable signal
handling will be designed in from the bottom up.  The external API
will be cleaned up; the core will be smaller and faster, and the XS
system for extension modules will be scrapped in favor of something
simpler and cleaner.  One perennial problem has been that installing a
new version of Perl has frequently broken binary compatibility with
older versions and required that all of Perl's unbundled extension
modules be recompiled; this may be fixed in Perl 6.</p>
<p>At the same time, the social structure behind Perl will also be
redesigned.  Larry said that the perl5-porters model was not working
well any more, and led to too much talk and too little action.  Perl
is too big for one person to manage, and the pumpkings burn out
quickly.  The new model will probably be several separate working
groups, each charged with the design and implementation of one aspect
of Perl.  Larry said that Perl 6 would be designed by the community,
and not by one person, and that with the new organization, Perl would
be able to evolve into the language that we need in 2020.</p>
<p>Probably most amazing was that the Porters agreed to break backwards
compatibility.  As Larry said on Wednesday, the language itself needs
revision.  On Wednesday, Larry mentioned several small, specific changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <code>system()</code> function will return true on success and false on failure.
<p></p>
<li>
The <code>localtime()</code> function will return the four-digit year.
<p></p>
<li>
The notion of "currently selected filehandle" will probably go away.
<p></p>
<li>
Typeglobs may be eliminated.
<p></p></ul>

But these are just by way of example.  Larry said &quot;We're really
serious about reinventing everything that needs reinventing.&quot;
Everything is up for discussion, and the suggestions so far have even
included giving Perl a pattern-matching system more like the one in
SNOBOL.
<p>It seems that the big technical inspiration that came out of the Tuesday
afternoon meeting was that it doesn't <code>have</code> to be backward
compatible.  Perl 5, right now, can compile a Perl program into its
internal syntax tree and then uncompile the tree back into source
code, using the <code>B::Deparse</code> module.  But you don't necessarily have
to produce the same source code you took in; you could instead
rearrange the code to produce a Perl 6 program to do the same thing.
So the upward migration path from Perl 5 to Perl 6 will probably be to
run your code through a translator.</p>
<p>Larry promised not to abandon Perl 5.  The 5.6 maintenance track will
continue as planned, and the 5.7 development track will eventually
yield Perl 5.8, as planned.  5.8 will be the final release of Perl
5, but it will continue to be maintained and stable.  Larry pointed
out that Perl 4 had not yet gone away, and there was no reason to
expect Perl 5 to go away either.  CPAN itself can serve as a
test suite for Perl 6:  When it can run most of the things in CPAN,
either directly or post-translation, it's ready.</p>
<p>Larry said that easy things should stay easy, hard things should get
easier, and impossible things should get hard.  He promised code in
one year: alpha code, but well-designed alpha code, and he called on
each person to play their part.</p>
<p>
<h2><a name="questions">Questions</a></h2>
<p>At the end of Larry's announcement, Jon Orwant graciously offered to cancel
his talk on "Rebuilding Postapocalyptic Civilization with Perl" so
that Larry could have a question and answer session.  These are the
questions that people asked, with Larry's answers.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="will perl 6 be in c++">Will Perl 6 be in C++?</a></b>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>
<b><a name="when can we expect the grand plan">When can we expect the grand plan?</a></b>
<p>Larry said that culturally, it has started already, and that we should
expect a roadmap this month.  His personal goal as language designer
was to have something substantial to say by the time of his Linux Expo
keynote speech in October.  But the schedule is not yet nailed down.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="will perl 6 have a spec">Will Perl 6 have a spec?</a></b>
<p>Larry said he did not know how strict it would be, and that he was not
big on specs.  He likes the reference implementation approach.
He said he wanted to particularly stress not a spec, but the
development of acceptance tests into regression and validation tests
that would say "This is Perl; this isn't."  He said that this was more
important than mere verbiage.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="will you look into technical infrastructure to support more constructive discussion than mailing lists can">Will you look into technical infrastructure to support more constructive discussion than mailing lists can?</a></b>
<p>Larry said that the Porters were thinking about 2-tier mailing lists
that each have a person in charge, and an RFC-like mechanism.  He said
that we would be paying less attention to the "Wouldn't it be nice if..."
type of proposals, and that proposals would need to be more formal and
official.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="can you hint at some of the language changes">Can you hint at some of the language changes?</a></b>
<p>Larry said that everything was negotiable.  He specifically mentioned
that Perl's old "formats" feature should probably be in a module
instead of in the core, and that he wanted to clean up ambiguities in
the indirect object syntax.  (This question concerns whether the
notation</p>
<code><pre>
        my $x = new Carrot (...);</pre></code>
<p>parses as if you had written</p>
<code><pre>
        my $x = new(Carrot(...));</pre></code>
<p>or as if you had written</p>
<code><pre>
        my $x = 'Carrot'-&gt;new(...);
</pre></code>

instead.  At present, this construction is rather fragile.)
<p>Larry said that since the Porters had decided to bite the bullet of
backward incompatibility anyway and require translation of Perl 5 to
Perl 6 code, they would consider any change at all, as long as it
could be translated.  He said that if 95% of all scripts could be
translated 95% accurately, and if 80% of scripts could be translated
100% accurately, that was probably good enough.</p>
<p>He said that the Porters wanted Perl to have all the features that
other languages say "nyah nyah" about, such as byte-compilation.  He
suggested that Perl's garbage collector might be replaced with a more
modern mark-sweep garbage collector, and that object finalization
might be separated from destruction.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="one problem of language translation is that you lose comments and formatting.">One problem of language translation is that you lose comments and formatting.</a></b>
<p>Larry replied that <code>a2p</code>, the AWK-to-Perl translator that is
bundled with Perl, which he wrote, doesn't have this problem, and that
he didn't think that the person asking the question would need to worry about this.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="is there a possibility of getting a switch construction">Is there a possibility of getting a <code>switch</code> construction?</a></b>
<p>(At this point Damian Conway shouted "I have a paper on that!")</p>
<p>Larry said, "Certainly."  (Meaning that there certainly was a
possibility, not that there certainly would be one.)  Then he said that he would not promise one.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="will there be an iso or ansi standard for perl">Will there be an ISO or ANSI standard for Perl?</a></b>
<p>"We will be our own standards body."</p>
<p>
<b><a name="how long have you been thinking about this">How long have you been thinking about this?</a></b>
<p>"Since yesterday."</p>
<p>
<b><a name="what about pod">What about POD?</a></b>
<p>Larry said it was all negotiable.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="which languages will you borrow from this time">Which languages will you borrow from this time?</a></b>
<p>"All of them."</p>
<p>(Then Larry said that they probably wouldn't borrow COBOL's
<code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</code> syntax, and that part of the reason there
was so little COBOL poetry is because it's hard to write a poem that
begins <code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</code>.)</p>
<p>He also mentioned the bytecode issue again, and said that it would be
nice to have a cleaner object-oriented interface to I/O.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="some people using perl to develop large software want features like strong typechecking. is there a possibility of providing this">Some people using Perl to develop large software want features like strong type checking.  Is there a possibility of providing this?</a></b>
<p>Larry said there was, and suggested a <code>use strict 'typechecking'</code>
directive, or maybe <code>use stricter</code>.   He also said that perl 6 should
get rid of many of the stranger global variables, such as <code>$#</code>.</p>

            <!-- Choosing a Perl Book -->

<br />
<p>There are a huge number of books out there about Perl. A quick search onAmazon reveals 362 books; allowing for false positives and books where
Perl is a minor part, I'd conservatively estimate there to be over 250
books primarily on Perl on the market at the moment. Are they any good?</p>

<p>Of course, if you don't know any Perl, it's impossible to say. There are
a few good reviews out there -- Tom Christiansen maintains a review site,
and the Perl Mongers have a set of reviews of some of the more popular
books too. And you can listen to personal testimonies from people who've
learnt from the books -- but they'll only tell you about the quality of
the teaching, not about the quality of the Perl. If you want to
make sure you're learning high-class Perl, you need something external
and objective.</p>

<p>So, let's have a look at a few criteria that you can use to evaluate
Perl books yourself; this is basically how I'd go about stress-testing a
new book when I got hold of it. If you don't know any Perl at all, you
may want to ask a friend to check a book out with you -- some of these
tests ask you to look for certain concepts and examples, and if you
don't know Perl, you won't necessarily know how to look for them!</p>

<p>First, though, it would be deceitful of me not to open with a
declaration of bias: I have written a beginner's book on Perl, and
obviously, I think it passes most of the tests I'm about to cover.
However, I'm not going to advertise here. The beauty of the free
software world is that you have freedom of choice, and that includes
the freedom to choose how you learn. My book may not suit you, but
someone else's might. That's fine. All I want is to make it easier for
you learn Perl, and this list should help you find a good way to do
that. Nevertheless, you might want to take what I say with a pinch of
salt, pepper, and Dijon mustard.</p>

<p>Anyway, on with the tests!

<h3>Who's the author?</h3>

<p>The first test is by no means an acid test. It's a hint, and that's all.
But good Perl programmers and teachers tend to be known in the Perl
community. It's perfectly possible for a Perl expert and an excellent
author to appear out of nowhere. But it's rare.</p>

<p>Perl encourages co-operation. We've got a huge repository of code, the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, which enables people to share their
code with the world. If someone's a really good Perl programmer, it's
highly likely they'll have come across a problem, abstracted the
solution into a module, and uploaded it for the benefit of others. So,
check out CPAN; you can search for the author's CPAN directory at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a> and see what they've
submitted, if anything. If they've got a directory on CPAN, then you
can download their code and have a look at it. Is it documented? Is the
documentation clear and easy to read? Does the code pass the other tests
here?</p>

<p>Another way people make a name for themselves in the Perl world is to
get involved with the development of Perl itself, in which case they'll
be posting to the
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/">perl5-porters mailing</a>.
Have a look at their posts, and see what sort of attitude they take
about Perl.</p>

<p>Thankfully, not everyone's a core developer, and -- don't get me wrong --
not being a developer is by no means an indication of not knowing Perl.
However, if they do appear on perl5-porters posting intelligent stuff,
this should be points in their favour.</p>

<p>Similarly, do they have a presence on Usenet, mailing lists, or Perl IRC
channels? Larry says that "Perl folks are, frankly, some of the most
helpful folks on earth" -- so is your potential author spending time
helping people out?</p>

<p>Again, this isn't an acid test -- some people can't stand Usenet or IRC,
some people (myself included) get far more mail than they can respond
to, and some have restricted Internet access, which makes it difficult
for them to get involved in this sort of thing.</p>

<p>But if you find someone helping out and getting involved in mailing
lists and Usenet, you've got a good opportunity to look at their style,
to see how they answer questions, and to see how they deal with issues that
might seem obvious to them.</p>

<p>The more information you can find about the author, the better.</p>

<h3>Ways To Get Help</h3>

<p>Perl comes with a huge set of documentation: at last count, 70,000 lines
of reference, tutorials, and other information. No introductory Perl book
could ever cover all that, nor should it. As Samuel Johnson said,
"Knowledge is of two kinds: we know a subject ourselves, or we know
where we can find information about it." Since a Perl book isn't going
to cover everything about the language by itself, it's important to
impart the second kind of knowledge as well as the first.</p>

<p>So, what does a good book need to tell you? It needs to talk about the
various documentation pages available. It needs to explain the
<code>perldoc</code> program for finding and reading the documentation. It needs
to mention the <code>perldoc -f</code> interface to the functions documentation
<font face="verdana">perlfunc</font>, and, for books published in the past couple of years, the
<code>perldoc -q</code> interface to the Frequently Asked Questions list. Ideally,
it should give examples of how to solve problems by referring to the FAQ
and the functions documentation; stress on how the user can find
information by themselves is important.</p>

<p>Finally, it needs to talk prominently about the fact that all Perl
modules contain their own documentation, itself available via
<code>perldoc</code>, and that programmers should write their own documentation
in the same way, using Perl's Plain Old Documentation.</p>

<h3><code>use strict</code> and warnings</h3>

<p>One objective a book should have is to encourage good programming style,
and Perl has many ways of helping programmers develop such a
style.</p>

<p>The most powerful is the warnings system. Perl's warnings catch a lot of
programming errors, and point out bad programming practices. There's
absolutely no excuse for having a program that doesn't run cleanly with
warnings turned on, especially if you're setting an example for
others to follow.</p>

<p>In Perl 5.6.0 and later, the warnings system is controlled by the words
<code>use warnings</code>; in previous versions of Perl, <code>-w</code> should appear on
the first line of a program, usually after something resembling
<code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code>. If the author isn't encouraging you to use warnings
-- if you don't see a <code>-w</code> on the top line of examples of full programs,
or a <code>use warnings</code> somewhere near the top of the code -- put the book
down. Forcefully.</p>

<p>The second method is a little more contentious, and I'll be discussing
why next time. Perl has a way to check that you know what you're doing
with your code: it forces you to be clearer with your use of variables
and subroutines, and it stops you from using symbolic references (which
we'll come to in a moment). Essentially, it's an idiot trap. It tells
Perl to be a lot more strict about what code it'll run, and so it's
called <code>strict</code>.</p>

<p>When you're programming casually just to get a job done by yesterday,
you don't need that kind of strictness. It's OK not to use it if you
fully understand why you should use it. On the other hand, if you're
teaching people, you want to be presenting them with the cleanest code
possible, and you want to encourage them not to be sloppy with their
programming. So, look for the words <code>use strict</code> around the beginning
of the examples. Some elements of <code>strict</code> are concerned with variable
use and scoping, which may not be discussed until quite late in the book
depending on how the author's chosen to lay it out, so don't worry if
you don't see <code>use strict</code> in the first few chapters. If you're still
seeing examples at the end of the book that don't contain it, be
suspicious.</p>

<h3>Return values on system calls</h3>

<p>Another good programming practice to encourage is defensive programming.

<p>Defensive programming is the idea that if things go wrong, you find out
early rather than suffer embarrassment later on. There are already far
too many programs out there that attempt to open a file, and
then blindly write away assuming the file was opened successfully
without actually confirming this. All your precious data is pumped into a
black hole. If warnings aren't turned on, you won't even know about it.
This isn't good. We don't want this. Even if you think that ninety-nine
times out of a hundred your <code>open</code> will succeed, that's one bad time too
many.</p>

<p>So, when we do anything involving the operating system, we make sure it
worked. Most calls to the system handily return a success-or-failure
value, so we can test them easily. You should see examples using forms
like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>
    open FILE, $filename or die "Couldn't open filename: $!\n";
</code>
</pre>
<p>That's pretty much the canonical form, with the possible use of <code>||</code>
and bracketing around the parameters to <code>open</code> instead of the <code>or</code>,
like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>
    open(FILE, $filename) || die "Couldn't open filename: $!\n";
</code>
</pre>
<p>If the author uses something other than this, you might consider
accusing them of avoiding idiom, something else we'll look at soon.</p>

<p>However, the point is that some sort of checking should occur. This is
great:</p>
<pre>
<code>
    if (!open FILE, $filename) {
        print "Something really bad happened. Sorry.\n";
        exit;
    }
</code>
</pre>
<p>But this is dangerous:
<pre>
<code>
    open FILE, $filename;
</code>
</pre>
<p>Examine the examples, and judge accordingly.

<h3>Symbolic references</h3>

<p>Yet another instance of good programming practice is the avoidance of
symbolic references, and a treatment of the variable-name-as-variable
question.</p>

<p>The question usually runs something like this: We read in a value from
the user -- say, "fruit" -- and we put it in a variable, <code>$wanted</code>. What
we want to do is to get the value of the variable <code>$fruit</code>, using the
contents of <code>$wanted</code> as our variable name.</p>

<p>Perl can do this, of course. But this is something you probably don't
want to do, and it smacks of a need to rethink your design. A book might
tell you how -- you say <code>${$wanted}</code>. Of course, this won't work if the
author's making good use of <code>use strict</code>, but we live in an imperfect
world.</p>

<p>The problem with these symbolic references is that they allow you to get
-- and change -- the value of any variable in the program. Given that Perl
keeps important settings about how it runs in special variables with
names that could quite easily crop up if things go wrong (<code>_</code>, <code>*</code>,
<code>.</code>, and so on), this is quite a dangerous practice. It's especially
dangerous since Perl provides a nice, easy way around this: a hash can
store and retrieve this data without affecting any other part of the
program.</p>

<p>A Perl book needs to mention this, since it's an idea that a lot of
novice programmers have, and the solution needs to be the right one.</p>

<h3>Treatment of <code>localtime</code></h3>

<p>This is less of an issue now that we're post-Y2K, but for books printed
before January 2000, have a look at how they treat Perl's built-in
<code>localtime</code> operator. They should mention that the operator returns a
human-readable string when used in scalar context, but that's pretty
basic. The interesting question is how they deal with the sixth element
(or fifth, for those of you counting from zero) of the list it returns.</p>

<p>This isn't the year. It looks a bit like the year, but it isn't. They
might describe it as the year, but it isn't. See, last year, it returned
<code>99</code>. A lot of people saw the <code>99</code> and assumed that <code>(localtime)[5]</code>
returns the last two digits of the century. This caused a lot of
hilarity in January when <code>(localtime)[5]</code> started returning <code>100</code>, and
a bunch of bad code got very confused.</p>

<p>The thing is, it wasn't 99 AD last year, just like it isn't 100 AD this
year. It was, however, 99 years after 1900, just like it's 100 years
after 1900 this year. That's what <code>(localtime)[5]</code> is -- the year minus
1900. (Hey, don't blame us. We inherited it from C.)</p>

<p>Any book that describes <code>(localtime)[5]</code> as being the last two digits
of the year had better be making some adjustments pretty soon....</p>

<h3>Explanation of Context</h3>

<p>Perl's functions and operators do things differently depending on
whether the thing that's calling them is expecting to receive a list, a
single value, or nothing at all; this is called B&lt;context>. It's an area
that's not very intuitive to existing programmers, and needs to be
covered well. Find the section on context in the book you're evaluating
-- there is one, isn't there? -- and read it through twice. Do you
understand what's going on yet?</p>

<h3>Explanation of Lexical versus Global</h3>

<p>A consequence of using the <code>strict</code> method of keeping your code clean
is that you have to distinguish between lexical and global variables.</p>

<p>Perl has two different systems of variables; Mark-Jason Dominus explains
the difference perfectly in his
<a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/FAQs/Namespaces.html">Coping With Scoping</a>
tutorial. Does your book cover the difference as well as that?</p>

<h3>Treatment of Bitwise Operators</h3>

<p>This is more an indicator of the author's attitude than a solid test
of competence.</p>

<p>Perl provides bitwise operators to manipulate numbers and strings on a
binary level. The thing is, you've hardly any cause to use them in
ordinary Perl programming. Perl's more of a high-level language than
that, and there's rarely a need to get into bit-twiddling.</p>

<p>If a book has a section on the bitwise operators, <code>|</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>~</code> and
<code>^</code>, consider why. Are they actually used again in the course of the
book, or are they just for show? As mentioned earlier,
books for beginners don't need to -- and possibly shouldn't -- tell you
everything about the language. Only what you need.</p>

<h3>Proper use of vocabulary</h3>

<p>For those of you who already know Perl, ask yourself whether the author
is using vocabulary in ways you expect. Some authors believe they can
explain concepts better by creating their own names for them. But
there's really no need for an author to make up their own vocabulary for
elements of the Perl language -- we've already got a perfectly good set
of vocabulary, and inventing more words only leads to confusion when the
learner is trying to communicate with another programmer.</p>

<h3>Operator Precedence</h3>

<p>Does the author explain how Perl's operator precedence works? Is time
taken out to discuss traps like this one:</p>
<pre>
<code>
    print (2*3) + 3;
</code>
</pre>
<p>This will print <code>6</code>, not <code>9</code>, because Perl sees <code>print(2*3)</code> and then
adds three to it. This is something that far too many programmers fall
into, and something that far too few books explain. Once it's explained
and the reader understands how it works, it makes perfect sense.
Otherwise, you'd have never thought of it. So the author has a
burden and a duty to explain traps like operator precedence; at the very
least, the book should contain a table of precedence, which should
mirror and explain the table found at the beginning of <font face="verdana">perlop</font>.</p>

<h3>Treatment of hashes</h3>

<p>A good Perl book explains not just what a hash is, but why and when to use
one. Briefly, a hash is a collection of correspondences: a phone book is
a hash that corresponds names with phone numbers. But that's not all
hashes are for.</p>

<p>I mentioned that hashes can be used as a much neater solution than
symbolic variables; hashes should also be applied to finding unique
elements and counting the number of each different element in a list.
Any time the word "unique" appears in a question, it should set off
hash-sounding alarm bells.</p>

<h3>Use of Modules</h3>

<p>A great many problems I see newcomers struggle with are problems that
have been solved before and made into modules. Perl philosophy encourages
the reuse of sections of code and the sharing of solutions; we don't
want anyone to repeat the mistakes we had to make. Tasks like reading
through HTML or understanding CGI requests are actually far more
difficult than they might first appear to the novice programmer, and
it's almost always better to use code that's known to be good.</p>

<p>So, Perl has a great library of tried and tested code, the CPAN we
mentioned earlier. The book should explain how to use modules, which
modules are good for common tasks, and how to locate, download, and
install modules from CPAN.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the book should positively encourage the reader to check
for existing modules before attacking a problem; it's not just a
practical matter, but also a matter of Perl philosophy -- Perl
people don't like reinventing the wheel, and they don't want you to
reinvent it either.</p>

<h3>Treatment of CGI</h3>

<p>A special case of this is the CGI module or its derivatives. CGI is a
particularly knotty area, although it seems relatively simple at first.</p>

<p>Any book dealing with CGI -- and that's going to be most books about Perl
these days -- needs to get a few things straight.</p>

<p>CGI is a protocol. It's not a programming language. It's just a formal
agreement between a web server and a program -- maybe in Perl, maybe in
another language -- that they're going to do things in a certain way.
That's all.</p>

<p>The problem is, CGI is quite a complex protocol; it has two methods of
getting data to a program, each of which works in a different way. Your program
can't ensure in advance which way it's going to get the data. The data
is encoded in a specific way; there might be a file attached, and the
data will have to be encoded slightly differently again. It's a tricky
problem, and this is exactly the time that programmers need to be
relying on tried-and-tested solutions. Emphasis on the CGI module or
CGI::Lite is absolutely and utterly essential.</p>

<h3>Taint checking and security</h3>

<p>Similarly essential is a discussion of secure programming; a quick
browse over Bugtraq or any other securities advisory mailing list turns
up a bunch of CGI programs written in Perl that have gaping holes. For
the most part, these problems could have been easily avoided.</p>

<p>Perl provides a mechanism, taint mode, for helping programmers think
about the security of their programs. It doesn't write secure programs
for you, but it forces you to think about what you're doing with your
data. It does this by flatly refusing to perform certain operations on
data derived from the outside world -- such data is "tainted" and needs to
be cleaned up before it is used. Taint mode is turned on with the <code>-T</code>
flag to Perl, and so "serious" examples of CGI programs really really
ought to start something like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>
     #!/usr/bin/perl -wT
     use strict;
     use CGI;
</code>
</pre>
<p>for books published before 5.6 was released, and</p>
<pre>
<code>
     #!/usr/bin/perl -T
     use warnings;
     use strict;
     use CGI;
</code>
</pre>
<p>for those published after. If not, put down the book and hunt down the
author.</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that turning on taint checking doesn't mean
your program is immediately secure -- a good Perl book should examine
other things that can go wrong, such as race conditions, temporary
files, file permissions, symbolic link chasing and so on. Bonus points
for those that talk about the <font face="verdana">Safe|Safe</font> module or other modules that
"sandbox" Perl's operation.</p>

<h3>Perl Philosophy and Idioms</h3>

<p>The final category we're going to examine is the most nebulous and
vague, and also the most difficult to spot. You want to examine whether
or not the author understands and follows Perl programming philosophy.</p>

<p>The most important part of this is that the author should not shy away
from using idioms. Perl's a living language, and you can never get a
complete understanding of a language unless you speak the way the
natives do -- "classroom Perl" stands out just as much as "classroom
French." Besides, out there in the real world, you're going to be coming
across idioms in other people's code, and a good book should prepare you
for these.</p>

<p>So, does the book stick rigidly to structures like this:
<pre>
<code>
     if ($this) {
          that;
     }
</code>
</pre>
<p>or does it make use of more relaxed forms:
<pre>
<code>
     $this and that;
     that if $this;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Does the book use <code>unless</code>, or stick to <code>if (!...)</code>? If it mentions
<code>select</code>, does it explain <code>select((select(OUTPUT_HANDLE), $| = 1)[0]);</code>?
Or how about <code>($a, $b) = ($b, $a)</code>? What about <code>switch</code> statement
idioms? Similarly, Perl has some nasty traps even for the best
programmer. (Some of these are detailed in <font face="verdana">perltrap</font>.) Are they
mentioned and explained in the book?</p>

<p>The overriding point is that the author should be prepared to get
your hands dirty. People out there speak slang, and you're going to need
to understand it.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Here are a few less important thoughts and questions I've come up with
to finish off your evaluation. Some of these are a matter of taste, so
I'll leave you to pick and choose.</p>
<ul>
<li>The language is Perl, the interpreter is <code>perl</code>. Neither of these is
PERL.</li>
<li>Any book published after 1996 with "Perl 5" in the title is missing
something. It's been Perl 5 since then, and I don't think anyone is
teaching Perl 4 these days. It's just Perl.</li>

<li>You can't learn Perl in 24 hours, 21 days, 12 weeks, 9 months, or a year.
I've been programming Perl for nearly five years and I'm still learning.</li>

<li>Do the examples follow the style conventions in <font face="verdana">perlstyle</font>?</li>

<li>Tom Christiansen has some notes about the typography of a book,
particularly on the use of monospaced typefaces for code and screen
output, distinguishable quotes (can you see the string <code>'"`'</code>?) and
brackets (what does <code>[({E&lt;gt>E&lt;lt>})]</code> look like?), and sensible
layout.

<ol>
<li>Is there a section on, and explanation of, one-liners? They're quite a
part of Perl culture.</li>

<li>Larry said "Perl programming is an *empirical* science." Are readers
encouraged to try things out when they're not sure how something works?</li>

<li>Learning Perl is meant to be fun. Is it fun to
read, or is it dry and clinical?
</li>
</ol>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Hopefully, I've given you some useful criteria to use in evaluating some of the
many books out there. Use these in conjunction with Tom's reviews,
Michael Schwern's reviews, Uri Guttman's Perl Books Page, and the Perl
Mongers book reviews, and you'll be able to get an all-round view of the
"Perlishness" of a book.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you find a book that makes Perl easy and fun for you,
and that gets you into good habits immediately.</p>

<P>Last month Yet Another Perl Conference 19100 was held at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I promised a
conference report when I got back, but once again found that I
couldn't really write it myself, because I had been a speaker and so
had missed a lot of the things that went on outside of my own events.</P>
<P>While trying to decide whom to get to write the report instead, I
realized that I was tired of conference reports written by one person.
Instead, I followed the pattern of one of the conference's big
successes, the Lightning Talks, and asked about twenty people to each
contribute a very short report on one or two aspects of the
conference.</P>
<P>The reports follow.  For more information about YAPC, visit
<A HREF="http://www.yapc.org/.">http://www.yapc.org/.</A>  Also note that the first YAPC::Europe
conference is coming up in London in September.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="schuyler d. erle">Schuyler D. Erle</A></H3>
<P>The first big highlight was probably Larry Wall's opening speech on
Bunyan's <EM>The Pilgrim's Progress</EM> and the development of perl, but I
found the talk's concluding Q&amp;A portion really unforgettable. Someone
asked Larry what the first thing was that he would go back and change
about perl, given the chance. His answer was succinct: The return
value of <CODE>system()</CODE>. `"Obviously," he announced, "If you want to
succeed, be true."</P>
<P>Friday's big excitement was mjd's Lightning Talks, a sort of
Conference Proceedings for the Attention Span Impaired. A lot of
people turned out to see the five-minute talks, most of which were
really well delivered. Amazingly, all of the speakers kept to their
allotted time, as marked by Dominus with a gong he seemed to have
mysteriously acquired for that purpose. The highlights of the Talks
were universally accorded to be Nat Torkington's twin discourses on "A
Day in the Life of p5p" and "What is it with those Python fucks,
anyway?", the latter of which was thoroughly tongue-in-cheek,
absolutely hilarious, and it's too damn bad for you if you missed it
because Nat has, apparently in the interests of peace, refused to make the
text of the speech public. "Of course our wheel is square. It's easier
to measure that way."</P>
<P>But, as always, the best part about YAPC is the people. After Friday's
proceedings, I, with every intention of going down to Forbes Av. and
getting too drunk to walk back to the dorms, instead happened upon
what apparently started out as an idle chat with Larry and Sean Burke
and mjd and a few others, and became this mad informal panel
discussion in the lounge that started with the genus of shellfish the
Phoenician used for dye and somehow ended up moving from there to the
philology of Lisp and Cobol to the decipherment of the <EM>Codex
Seraphinianus</EM> and beyond, digressing continually for all kinds of
other esoteric insanity. I mostly sat and listened, utterly
fascinated. I never did make it out to the bars. I swear, the perl
community is a bright lot, and, boy, YAPC is a great place to get a
healthy dose of humility. Thank God it only happens once a year.</P>
<P>[ Details about the Lightning Talks are available at
<A HREF="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html</A> --D. ]</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="avi">Avi</A></H3>
<P>For me, YAPC started around 9:00 on Wednesday, June 22nd.  I showed up
a bit too late to catch Kevin Lenzo's introductory talk, but just in
time to catch Mark-Jason Dominus' talk on strong typing, an
interesting talk about the pitfalls and triumphs of typing systems in
various programming languages.  Mr. Dominus is an incredible speaker,
and even while he was clearly quite exhausted, the talk was very
interesting.</P>
<P>After this talk, I hopped over the Randal Schwartz's "Learning Perl"
room for about an hour.  Now I can't say how good this talk is for
perl beginners, not having been one myself for quite a while, but I
always like to go see Randal speak for at least a little while at
these conferences.  Every time I go, I learn something new about perl
that I just hadn't noticed before.  For example, at YAPC I learned
about the return value of <CODE>print</CODE> and the behaviour of <CODE>reverse(@)</CODE>.
However, I can only last about an hour before the dreadful jokes and
auctioneer-style patter start to really get to me.</P>
<P>After lunch I returned to the Dominus room where the famed "Wizards"
talk was getting under way.  In just under an hour and a half, I
learned an immense amount about globs, knobs, references and other
sundries that go on under the cover of the stash.  Unfortunately,
shortly after the final break for the day had begun, I was again
overcome by anxiety and had to leave.  I spent the rest of YAPC at
home and at work, but I hear it was also very cool.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="gene boggs: day 2">Gene Boggs: Day 2</A></H3>
<P>Woke up and made for the shower to catch Larry Wall's opening
talk, stopping only to smile as Larry and backpack walked silently by.</P>
<P>Got to the auditorium (after wolfing down excellent catered YAPC 
breakfast of fresh fruit and bagels), sat by mjd, and listened to Larry  
speak through the allegorical adventures of Christian in the book,  
"Pilgrims Progress."</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sean m. burke">Sean M. Burke</A></H3>
<P>Listening to a Damian Conway talk (whether about OOP, or about quantum
programming) is like going to an old-time Grateful Dead show: it goes
on hours longer than expected, but by even halfway through you're
tripping too hard to care.</P>
<P>John Orwant's talk discussed concepts of copyright by pointing out
design features of things (an ashtray, an ice bucket, a lamp!) that he
snuck out of his hotel room -- using stolen property to explain
intellectual property.</P>
<P>As to the post-talk festivities: There's not many conferences you can
go to where people, once a bit drunk, will declare how delicious the
word "ontogenesis" is, swap tips on where to get a copy of the <EM>Codex
Seraphinianus</EM>, and then go make fun of whatever's on ESPN.</P>

<P>YAPC was an interesting mix of brilliant, delightful, vulgar, pompous,
engaging, boring, and fun people.  I say people, because the people
eclipsed the event proper.  When I think about what talks I went to
see and why, I realize that I went to see a certain person speak and
not to see a certain topic elaborated.  So what we had was essentially
a huge multi-day all-night technical bull-session with a wide variety
of people, led by the cream of the crop.  Well, frankly, what could be
more fun for a crowd of geeks?</P>
<P>Yes, fun.  Sure, I justified all my expenses as training costs to my
employer, but at the end of the day we had a lot of fun.  Certainly
some great things were learned, but mostly contact was made with
plenty of smart people and we had a good time doing it.  What I
remember most vividly, for example, are events that happened far from
the conference schedule:</P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>
Discussing the autism and language with Larry Wall, Sean Burke, and
Mark-Jason Dominus at some terrible hour in the crossroads of the
dormitory.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Having my room invaded by several luminaries for an impromptu
discussion on Perl, the universe, and Space Ghost at 3am while trying
to prepare slides for my talk the next day.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Being discretely offered computing services in the wee hours by folks
who should know better but feel that getting Larry on-line at 4am is
more important than the rules.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Being offered long distance cell phone time from a large number of
caring #perl folks so that I could call home and talk to the
sweetheart we had to leave behind for the week.
<P></P>
<DT><DD>
Throwing a frisbee on the lawn with Perl people when it was so dark
that the disk could not be seen until it was 2 meters from your face.
<P></P></DL>
<P>I'd chew off my own leg before missing the next one.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="lisa nyman: report from a firsttime presenter">Lisa Nyman:  Report from a First-time Presenter</A></H3>
<P>While I have presented papers at other conferences in the past, I have
always been nervous about presenting at a Perl conference. I thought
no one would find my work interesting or innovative.  I was wrong.</P>
<P>YAPC was the ideal venue to discuss my latest project (the Census 2000
Internet Form) and all the open source issues related to its
development.  Being a speaker opened up a lot of conversations with
people who, in their search for advocacy support, were curious about
my agency's work with Perl and open source. Someone asked me
optimistically "But is open source part of your agency's <EM>strategic
plan?</EM>"  Well, it isn't, but that hasn't stopped us from depending on
it.</P>
<P>So gather your ideas and start putting together your presentations for
next year.  Use your local PerlMongers meetings as a proving ground.
Take advantage of the small crowds and congenial atmosphere of YAPC to
get your feet wet in the waters of the Perl conference circuit.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="clinton pierce">Clinton Pierce</A></H3>
<P>Initially, I had two goals for YAPC.  The first was to get in touch
with some of the Perl Culture that I've been missing out on.  Second
was to learn some things about Perl that I really didn't know.</P>
<P>I attended Dick Hardt's "Programming for the People," and the talk
itself wasn't the part I found fascinating -- it was the audience.
The surprising thing was how heavily they (and Activestate!) rely on
the Perl Culture as a backbone.  They want someone like Activestate to
give them polished tools.  They need the gurus and "heavies" of the
Perl culture, if for nothing else to tell them where to go.  For them,
it's not important that Perl is a swiss army chainsaw -- they're
interested in the service department, sales staff, and the user
groups.  They can't get this level of support from any other toolset.
And I agree completely.</P>
<P>A lot of the new Perl I learned wasn't perl.  First was MJD's talk on
why a strongly typed Perl doesn't have to suck.  A lot of the talk was
about ML!  It may seem out of place, but learning just enough ML to
really see the benefits of strong typing kind of makes me hope that
Perl 6 has some of that as an option.  (I feel so dirty!)  The JAPH
talk that I went to wasn't really Perl either.  It was terribly
perverse laughing at how Perl can be molded to even the most twisted
of minds (Hi Abigail!).  If you've never been able to decode a JAPH
before, find Abigail's slides on the Web and learn frightening things
about the language you THOUGHT you knew.</P>
<P>[Abigail's JAPH talk slides are available at
<A HREF="http://ucan.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/Talks/Japhs/">http://ucan.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/Talks/Japhs/</A>  --D.]</P>

<H3><A NAME="nathan torkington">Nathan Torkington</A></H3>
<P>Getting to YAPC was miserable.  United screwed me over a ticket
change, so I had to pay $700 at the last minute for tickets on
Vanguard.  They ran late, I missed my bus on the return trip, and so
on.  Bah.</P>
<P>I had a great time at the conference proper, oh yes.  I got to see all
my friends, catch some great talks, and have some fun giving talks.</P>
<P>Friends.  Standout evening: getting toasted at the church brewpub
(http://www.churchbrew.com/) on Saturday night.  Other highlights:
discussing the philosophy of OO and teaching OO with Damian Conway and
Joseph Hall; sitting around the hotel bar in the evenings with Jarkko
Hietaniemi, Elaine Ashton, Sean Burke, Jon Orwant, and Mik Firestone,
yammering about everything until the wee hours; Mik's killer hooch
(home-aged lemon and vodka); Elaine's whiskey; the trip to Falling
Water on Saturday with Jon and Damian.</P>
<P>Other people's talks.  Damian's Quantum Superpositions talk was
stellar, even if it did lead to tedious repetition of the phrase "in
constant time" afterward.  Jon's Apocalypse talk was a fine
continuation from last year's.  Adam Turoff's Quizzo was a lot of fun
(I'm not just saying that because our fabulous team placed) and I hope
we see it again next year.  The lightning talks were cosmic and I
liked them so much I'm going to beg Mark-Jason to do them next year at
TPC.</P>
<P>My talks.  My three hour tutorial on "The Seven Stages of a Perl
Programmer," based on a great post Tom Christiansen made to
perl5-porters in 1997 was fun.  I gave two 20-minute talks on advocacy
and the uniqueness of Perl, while my head spun from cold medicine.
And I gave two five-minute lightning talks, one satirizing the
perl5-porters mailing list, and the other a Dennis Miller-style rant
against the over-zealous Python advocacy I've seen lately.  Notes for
all my talks, except the Python rant, are at
<A HREF="http://prometheus.frii.com/~gnat/yapc/">http://prometheus.frii.com/~gnat/yapc/</A>.</P>
<P>Summary: a blast.  Can't wait to do it again.  Great job, Kevin!</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="adam turoff">Adam Turoff</A></H3>
<P>While at YAPC this year, I would look around every so often and wonder
if the conference program was an elaborate ruse to get nearly 400
Perl programmers together to sit and chat.</P>
<P>One discussion I had on the way to dinner was about what's broken with
CPAN.  One of the points mentioned was that Perl in general and CPAN
in particular does not accept multiple competing implementations of
modules.  On the one hand, it sounds like a violation of TMTOWTDI, but
on the other hand, CPAN symbolizes The Perl Way.  Playing with this
idea in detail, I began to realize that there's a zeroth law that
supercedes TMTOWTDI: Perl encourages sharing and collaboration over
standardization and competition.</P>
<P>Over another chat, I met Ranga Nathan, a Perl programmer who spends a
lot of time with COBOL code.  We talked about a decent number of
issues, and found an example of a point Nat Torkington made during one
of his talks.  When Perl doesn't go whole-hog into OOP or CORBA, it
could be a sign that these bloated technologies are really unnecessary
for solving real-world problems.  People like Ranga who are coming out
of the glass house of mainframes are coming into Perl and skipping
pass objects and multithreading, and finding themselves happy and
productive using Perl, ignoring all of the hype that comes with other
languages.</P>
<H3><A NAME="markjason dominus">Mark-Jason Dominus</A></H3>
<P>I don't really remember much of what happened at YAPC.  I took the
redeye in from San Diego and arrived at about 6 AM the morning that
the conference began.  Kevin told me that Joe had been delayed, and
asked if I would fill in for him, and for some reason I said "yes."  I
suppose part of the reason is that I don't get very many opportunities
to give my talk on how <EM>Strong Typing Doesn't Have to Suck</EM>.  I think
the talk went really well, because it requires that I jump up and down
and froth at the mouth and scream about how awful the type checking in
Pascal is, and it turns out that it's a lot easier to do that when
I've just come in on the redeye from San Diego.</P>
<P>The rest of the conference was a big blur for me.  I gave twelve hours
of talks in two days, and then I made a midnight excursion with
Abigail to obtain the gong for the Lightning Talks.  The next day I
was signed up for paintball, and as we were waiting for people to
finish assembling so we could leave, I suddenly realized that it just
wasn't going to happen, and I got my money back.</P>
<P>One of the paintballers took this picture just before they left:</p>

Next week's report will be a little early, because I'm going to try to
get it out before the big Perl conference.   Then the following report
will be a little late, because I will have just gotten back from the
big Perl conference.
</P>

<P>

<H3><a name="Bug_Database">Bug Database</a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Alan Burlison reporterd a minor bug in 
<CODE>h2xs</CODE>, and pointed out that it had been fixed betwen 5.005_03 and 5.6.0,
and also that there were at least three open tickets in the bug
database that appear to have been resolved by this fix.  He suggested
that the database support an interest list for each bug, and send mail
to everyone on the interest list when there was a status change for
their bug.   Richard Foley said he would look into this.
</P>

<P>
This led to a large discussion about the bug database and bug tracking
generally.  Simon said that he thought the entire bug system needed a
complete overhaul.  Specifically, he said he wanted to see the two (or
three) bug databases replaced by a single database; ownership of
tickets by people who are addressing the bugs, with automatic
reversion to the `unowned' pile if the owner doesn't take some
periodic action such as responding to an automatic email; weekly
automatic reports to p5p on outstanding tickets and to ticket owners.
</P>

<P>
Richard Foley replied that some of this is in progress, or is easy.
For example, other bug databases can send email into his perlbugtron
to enter their bugs there.  Also he can set up a cron job to sent p5p
a weekly status report.  But it's not clear that such a report would
be useful unless someone cleas up the existing database, checking over
all the outstanding bugs, closing the ones that are fixed in 5.6.0,
weeding out the non-bugs, merging reports that appear to be the same
bug, and soforth.  Nat Torkington mentioned that he had started to do
this a few months ago, but stopped, because the job is so big.
</P>

<P>
Nat then pointed out that this would be a good way for beginning p5p
people to gain expertise.  Sarathy agreed that the biggest problems
appeared not to be technical, but that there is no bug champion who
has taken responsibility for taking care of the database.  I mentioned
that I had been planning to take this up after the conference this
month, and had been moving into the job stealthily by reportong on
open bugs in these reports, and encouraging people to try to fix them.
Several people volunteered to help categorize bugs and close tickets.
</P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-07/msg00205.html">Alan Burlison described his imagined bug lifecycle.</a></P>

<P>
Summary of Alan's ideas:
<ol><li></P>

<P>
The bug is reported.
<li>The bug is routed to the 'triage' person for its category.
<li>A registered bugfixer is assigned the bug from a queue or unassigned bugs.
<li>The bugfixer fixes the bug and mails in a patch.  
</ol></P>

<P>
Simon suggested that one way to prevent the problem from getting worse
is to let people close tickets by email.  If a bug fixer cc's their
patch to an address like 
<CODE>close-##bugid##@bugs.perl.org</CODE>, that could automatically close the ticket.  Richard appeared to be
willing to support this.
</P>

<P>
Simon also mentioned that he is starting up a 
<a href="http://sourcetalk.perlhacker.org/">web site</a> for discussion of the Perl source code and internals and nurturing of
 new Perl core hackers.
</P>

<P>
There was some discussion of alternate bug tracking systems, including
Debian's, which is reputed to be good, but the consensus seemed to be
that it was not appropriate for Perl.
</P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-07/msg00108.html">Root of this thread.</a></P>

<P>

<H3><a name="buildtoc"><code>buildtoc</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Jarkko did some work on 
<CODE>pod/buildtoc</CODE>, which is the program that constructs the 
<CODE>perltoc</CODE> man page.  He made a long list of pods that had been added but which
 were not in 
<CODE>buildtoc</CODE>'s list of files to include.
Jes&uacute;s Quiroga sent his list of pods that are in the 5.6.0 
distribution---there are 326 of them.  There was some discussion about
what to do with the many miscellaneous and platform-specific items,
but no clear conclusion.
</P>

<P>
Jarkko also reordered the brief table of contents that is in 
<CODE>perl.pod</CODE>.  I am glad; it was always embarassing to be teaching a class of Perl
beginners, to proudly say ''Look, if you do 
<CODE>man perl</CODE> you get a list of the other manuals,'' and then to see three different
 versions of 
<CODE>perldelta</CODE> there at the top of the list.  There was a little discussion about
 how to order the items, and about whether or not 
<CODE>perlbook.pod</CODE> should remain in the distribtution.
</P>

<P>

<H3><a name="use_namespace"><code>use namespace</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Alan Burlison wants to be able to say 
</P>

</P><PRE>
        use namespace Sun::Solaris;
</PRE>

<P>
and then have
</P>

</P><PRE>
        my $obj = Foo::Bar->new(...);
</PRE>

<P>
be interpreted as if he had written
</P>

</P><PRE>
        my $obj = Sun::Solaris::Foo::Bar->new(...);
</PRE>

<P>
instead.  This is very similar to a suggestion that Michael King made
last year, except that Michael also had some other ideas that were
unpalatable.
</P>

<P>

<a href="/pub/1999/10/p5pdigest/THISWEEK-19991017.html#bundling">Previous discussion.</a></P>

<P>

Alan said he would be willing to try to implement this, but first he
wanted to hear people's comments about whether it was advisable.
</P>

<P>
Graham suggested that the 
<CODE>namespace</CODE> pragma would not modify the meaning of constructions like this:
</P>

</P><PRE>
        my $obj = Foo::Bar->new(...);
</PRE>

<P>
but rather, only those that looked like this:        
</P>

</P><PRE>
        my $obj = ::Foo::Bar->new(...);
</PRE>

<P>
Then you would still be able to use other modules, even in the scope of 
<CODE>use namespace</CODE>.  He also pointed out that to work properly it would have to have a
lexical scope.  A bunch of other possible semantics were discussed,
all of which seemed to me to be obviously The Wrong Thing.  
</P>

<P>
There was a tangent discussion about the uses of 
<CODE>__PACKAGE__</CODE>.
</P>

<P>

<H3><a name="Unicode_Input_Solution">Unicode Input Solution</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Simon reported a clever suggestion from the Perl-Unicode mailing list.
Some systems, such as Windows, store system data like directory
entries in unicode.  You'd like to flag such inputs as UTF8 when they
are read in.  The suggestion was to piggyback this atop the tainting
mechanism.  At present, there's a macro which, if taint mode is on,
turns on the taint flag on the input scalar for every input Perl reads
from any source.  Simon posted a patch which extends the macro so that
if 
<CODE>use utf8</CODE> is in scope, and the string is a valid UTF8 string, Perl will also
 set the 
<CODE>UTF8</CODE> flag on the scalar.   Since presumably everything is already checked for
 taintedness when it's read in, this automatically puts the check for
UTF8-ness everywhere also.
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-07/msg00026.html">Read about it.</a></P>

<P>

<H3><a name="tra_z_0"><code>tr/a-z-0//</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>
I reported that this is equivalent to 
<CODE>tr/a-y//</CODE>, because the ranges are expanded inline from left to right, so the
original 
<CODE>tr</CODE> becomes 
<CODE>tr/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-0//</CODE>, and then the 
<CODE>z-0</CODE> is discarded (because there are no characters between 
<CODE>z</CODE> and 
<CODE>0</CODE>.  Sometime later, I sent a patch, and also sent a patch that forbids 
<CODE>X-Y</CODE> when 
<CODE>X</CODE> occurs after 
<CODE>Y</CODE>.   The latter was already a fatal error in a regex character class;
it turns out that the code for range parsing in  
<CODE>tr</CODE> is totally separate from the analogous range parsing code for regexes.
</P>

<P>

<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-07/msg00054.html">Patch #1.  </a><a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-07/msg00095.html">Patch #2.</a></P>

<P>

<H3><a name="Mutual_use">Mutual <code>use</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Alan Burlison wanted to know what to do when he needs to have two
modules, each of which 
<CODE>use</CODE>s the other.  Various solutions were proposed, mostly of the form
'Don't do that'.  THe currect answer in Alan's case was to factor out
the part of B that was needed by A into a separate module, C, and have
A 
<CODE>use</CODE> C and B 
<CODE>use</CODE> A.
<H3><a name="sprintf_tests"><code>sprintf</code> tests</a></H3>

</P>

<P>

Sarathy pointed out a problem with Dominic Dunlop's excellent 
<CODE>sprintf</CODE> tests:  Not all systems produce output with exactly two digits of
 exponent information, so many tests fail on Windows systems, for
 example.  (The C standard only requires that there be 
 at least two digits.)  Dominic said he would think about what to do
 about this, but has not said anything about it since then.
</P>

<P>

<H3><a name="Complex_Expressions_in_Formats">Complex Expressions in Formats</a></H3>

</P>

<P>
H. Merijn Brand fixed a bug that he reported last month:  Complex
expressions like 
<CODE>$h{foo}[1]</CODE> were misparsed when they appeared in 
<CODE>format</CODE> lines.

</P>

<P>

Bryan C. Warnock asked what would happen if he were to change 
<CODE>PL_shell_path</CODE> to point to some shell that was not Bourne-compatible.  Nobody
 answered, possibly because nobody has tried before.

If Bryan reports back later I will mention it.

<H3><a name="UNTIE_Method"><code>UNTIE</code> Method</a></H3>

<P>
Brian S. Julin expressed a wish for an 
<CODE>UNTIE</CODE> method which would be called automatically when you untie a tied
 variable.  I said I had wanted such a thing for a long time (since
at least early 1998, apparently) but I did not provide a patch.

A large collection of bug reports, bug fixes, non-bug reports,

Simon wrote a clear and amusing summary of what Unicode is and how to
deal with it.  If you've been puzzled by all this unicode stuff, you
should certainly 
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-07/msg00004.html">Read about it.</a></P>

<P>

<H4><a name="Unicode_Regex_Matching">Unicode Regex Matching</a></H4>

</P>

<P>
Simon also asked what would happen if you did this:
</P>

</P><PRE>
        $b = v300
        v196.172.200 =~ /^$b/;
</PRE>

<P>
(This is an issue because the UTF8 representation of 
<CODE>$b</CODE> is actually
the two bytes with values 196 and 172.)  But Gisle said that of course
it should not match, because the target string does not in fact
contain character #300.
</P>

<P>
This led to a brief discussion of what the regex engine should do with UTF8
strings.  The problem here goes back to the roots of the UTF8
implementation.  
</P>

<P>
Larry's original idea was that if 
<CODE>use utf8</CODE> was in scope, operation would assume that all data was UTF8 strings,
 and if not, they would assume byte strings.  This puts a lot of
burden on the programmer and especially on the module writer.  For
example, suppose you had wanted to write a function that would return true
if its argument were longer than 6 characters:
</P>

</P><PRE>
        sub is_long {
          my ($s) = @_;
          length($s) > 6;
        }
</PRE>

<P>
No, that would not work, because if the caller had passed in a UTF8 string,
then your answer ouwld be whether the string was longer than six 
<em>bytes</em>, not six characters.  (Remember characters in a UTF8 may be longer
than one byte each.)  You would have had to write something like this instead:
</P>

</P><PRE>
        sub is_long {
          my ($s) = @_;
          if (is_utf8($s)) {
            use utf8;
            length($s) > 6;
          } else {
            length($s) > 6;
          }
        }
</PRE>

<P>

This approach was abandoned several versions ago, and you can see why.
The current approach is that every scalar carries around a flag that
says whether it is a UTF8 string or a plain byte string, and
operations like 
<CODE>length()</CODE> are overloaded to work on both kinds of strings; 
<CODE>length()</CODE> returns the number of characters in the string whether or not the
 string is UTF8.
</P>

<P>
Now here's a dirty secret: Overloading the regex engine this way is
difficult, and hasn't been done yet.  Regex matching ignores the UTF8
flag in its target.  Instead, it uses the old method that was
abandoned:  if it was compiled with 
<CODE>use utf8</CODE> in scope, it assumes that its argument is in UTF8 format, and if not,
 it assumes its argument is a byte string.
</P>

<P>
The right thing to do here is to fix the regex engine so that its
behavior depends on whether the UTF8 flag in the target.  The hard way
(but the right way) is to really fix the regex engine.  The easier way
is to have the regex engine compile everything as if 
<CODE>use utf8</CODE> was not in scope, and then later on if it is called on to match a
 UTF8 string, it should recompile the regex as if 
<CODE>use utf8</CODE> had been enabled, and stash that new compiled regex alongside the
 original one for use with UTF8 strings.

<P>

<H4><a name="Normalization">Normalization</a></H4>

</P>

<P>

This led Simon to ask if Perl should have support for normalization.
What is normalization?  Unicode has a character for the letter 'e' (U+0065),
and a character for an acute accent (U+00B4), which looks something like 
&acute; and is called a 'combining character' because it combines with the
 following character to yield an accented character; when the string
 containing an acute accent is displayed, the accent should be
 superimposed on the previous character.
But Unicode also has a character for the letter e 
<em>with</em> an acute accent (U+00E9), as &eacute;.  This should be displayed the same way as the two character sequence U+00B4 U+0065.
</P>

<P>
Perl does not presently do this, and if you have two strings, produced
by  
<CODE>pack "U*", 0xB4, 0x65</CODE> and by 
<CODE>pack "U*", 0xE9</CODE> it reports them as different, which they certainly are.  But clearly, for some
 applications, you would like them to be considered equivalent, and
 Perl presently has no built-in function to recognize this.
</P>

<P>
Fergal Daly pointed out that Doug's patch will break abstract base
classes, because it extends the semnatics of 
<CODE>use Dog $spot</CODE> to mean something new.  Formerly, it meant that 
<CODE>$spot</CODE> was guaranteed to be implemented with a pseudohash, and that the
 fields in 
<CODE>$spot</CODE> were guaranteed to be a subset of those specified in 
<CODE>%Dog::FIELDS</CODE>.  Doug's patch now adds the meaning that method calls on 
<CODE>$spot</CODE> will be resolved at compile time by looking for them in class 
<CODE>Dog</CODE>.  This is a change, because it used to be that it was permissble to
assign 
<CODE>$spot</CODE> with an object from some subclass of 
<CODE>Dog</CODE>, say 
<CODE>Schnauzer</CODE>, as long as its fields were laid out in a way that was compatible
with 
<CODE>%Dog::FIELDS</CODE>.  But now you cannot do that, because when you call 
<CODE>$spot->meth</CODE> you get 
<CODE>Dog::meth</CODE> instead of 
<CODE>Schnauzer::meth</CODE>.  
</P>

<P>
Oops.
</P>

<P>
Some discussion ensued.  Sarathy suggested that the optimization only
be enabled if, at the end of compilation, 
<CODE>Dog</CODE> has no subclasses.  Fergal said it would be a shame to limit it to
 such cases, and it would not be much harder to enable the
 optimization for any method that was not overridden in any subclass.
</P>

<P>
Discussion is ongoing.
</P>

<P>

<H3><a name="my___PACKAGE___foo"><code>my __PACKAGE__ $foo</code></a></H3>

</P>

<P>
Doug MacEachern contributed a patch that allows 
<CODE>my __PACKAGE__ $foo</CODE>, where 
<CODE>__PACKAGE__</CODE> represents the current package name.  There was some discussion about
whether the benefit was worth ths cost of the code bloat.  Doug said
that it was useful for the same reasons that 
<CODE>__PACKAGE__</CODE> is useful anywhere else.  (As a side
note, why is it that the word 'bloat' is never used except in
connection with three-line patches?)
</P>

<P>

Andreas Koenig said that it would be even better to allow 
<CODE>my CONSTANT $foo</CODE> where 
<CODE>CONSTANT</CODE> is any compile-time constant at all, such as one that was created by 
<CODE>use constant</CODE>.  Doug provided an amended patch
 to do that also.
</P>

<P>
Jan Dubois pointed out that this will break existing code that has a
compile-time constant that is of the same name as an existing patch.  
Andreas did not care. 
<blockquote><b>Andreas Koenig:</b> Who uses constants that have the same name as existing and actually used classes isn't coding cleanly and should be shot anyway.  </blockquote></P>

<P>

More persuasively, he pointed out that under such a circumstance, 
<CODE>my Foo $x = Foo->new</CODE> would not work either, because the 
<CODE>Foo</CODE> on the right would be interpreted as a constant instead of as a class name.

</P>

<P>
Last week I sent aggrieved email to a number of people asking what 
<CODE>cfgperl</CODE> was and why there appeared to be a secret source repository on
 Jarkko's web site that was more up-to-date than the documented source
repository.  I was concerned that there was in inner circle of
development going on with a hidden development branch that was not
accessible to the rest of the world.
</P>

<P>
Jarkko answered me in some detail in email, and then posted to p5p to
explain the real situation.
<CODE>cfgperl</CODE> is simply the name for Jarkko's 
<em>private</em> copy of the source, to which he applies patches that he deems worthy.
It got ahead of the main repository because Sarathy was resting last month.

Dominic Dunlop reported an interesting bug in the new

Some time ago, Nicholas Clark pointed out that many regression tests
will fail if you opt not to build all of Perl's standard extension
modules, such as 
<CODE>Fcntl</CODE>.
</P>

<P>

<a href="/pub/2000/06/p5pdigest/THISWEEK-20000618.html#Extensions_required_for_regression_tests">Previous discussion.</a></P>

<P>

A sidetrack developed out of Nicholas' patch to fix this, discussing
the best way to make sure that tests get the test version of the
library, and not the previously installed version of the library.
Nicholas was using 
</P>

</P><PRE>
        unshift '../lib';
</PRE>

<P>
This is a common idiom in the test files.
What's wrong with it?  It leaves the standard directories in 
<CODE>@INC</CODE>, which may not be appropriate, and it assumes that the library is in a
sibling directory, so you cannot run the test without being in the 
<CODE>t/</CODE> directory itself.
</P>

<P>
There was a little discussion of the right thing to do here.  Mike Guy
suggested that one solution would be to have the test harness set up
the environment properly in the first place.   The problem with that
is that then you can't run the tests without the harness.  (For
example, you might want to run a single test file; at present you can
just say 
<CODE>perl t/op/dog.t</CODE> or whatever.)  
</P>

<P>
Sarathy pointed out that having each test file begin with something
like
</P>

</P><PRE>
        BEGIN { @INC = split('|',$ENV{PERL_TEST_LIB_PATH}
                                          || '../lib') }
</PRE>

<P>
might solve the problem.  Then the harness can set 
<CODE>PERL_TEST_LIB_PATH</CODE> but you can still run a single test manually if you are in the right place.
