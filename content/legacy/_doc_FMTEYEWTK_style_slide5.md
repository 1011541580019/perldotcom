-   Explain what the code does, don't just perl2englishify.
-   Eschew gaudy block banners.
-   Use comments in regexes with `/x`.
-   Comment entire blocks, not single lines.
-   \`Comments on data are usually much more helpful than on algorithms.' (Rob Pike)
-   \`Basically, avoid comments. If your code needs a comment to be understood, it would be better to rewrite it so it's easier to understand.' (Rob Pike)
