-   Until you start thinking in terms of hashes, you're not thinking in Perl. They can often replace lengthy loops or complex algorithms.
-   Use a hash whenever you want to represent a set, a relation, a table, a structure, or a record.
-   The words \`in', \`unique', \`first', and \`duplicate' should all set off Pavlovian screams of \`HASH!' If you find them in the same sentence as \`array', you're probably doing something wrong.
