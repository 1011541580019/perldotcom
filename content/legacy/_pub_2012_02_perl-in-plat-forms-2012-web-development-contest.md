Thanks to [Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ](http://search.cpan.org/~daxim/) for coordinating entries into the [Plat\_Forms 2012](http://www.plat-forms.org/platforms-2012-announcement#overview) web development contest. This annual contest pits some of the best developers of frameworks and languages against each other to solve real problems. Perl developers have participated for several years. Teams using Catalyst, Dancer, and Mojolicious have all demonstrated their platform strengths and weaknesses.

No Perl team has won the contest—yet. With the rise of modern Perl 5, the extra energy from competition between all of the great platforms, and (of course) the power of the CPAN, we all expect great things. Consider entering and showing what we can do.
