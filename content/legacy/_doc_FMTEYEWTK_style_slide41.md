-   Document your modules with Pod. Test your pod with *pod2man* and with *pod2html*.
-   Use the Carp module's `carp`, `croak`, and `confess` routines, not `warn` and `die`.
-   Well written modules seldom require `::`. Users should get at module contents using an import or a class method call.
-   Traditional modules are fine. Don't jump to full objects just because it's considered cool. Do it only when the occasion obviously calls for it.
-   Access to objects should only be through object methods.
-   Object methods should themselves access class data through pointers on the object.
