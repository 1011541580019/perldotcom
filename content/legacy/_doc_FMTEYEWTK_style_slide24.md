-   Beginners often think they want to have a variable contain the name of a variable.

            $fred    = 23;
            $varname = "fred";
            ++$varname;         # $fred now 24

-   This works sometimes, but is a bad idea. They **only work on global variables**. Global variables are bad because they can easily collide accidentally.
-   They do not work under the use strict pragma
-   They are not true references and consequently are not reference counted or garbage collected.
-   Use a hash or a real reference instead.
