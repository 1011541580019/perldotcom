### <span id="Generators">Generators</span>

(8 posts) Clark C. Evans [asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07228.html) whether Parrot will support generators, a cousin to continuations. Dan Sugalski [says](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07241.html) coroutines and continuations are in, but didn't really answer about generators. (As a sidebar, the rest of the thread was an interesting discussion about Python's recent addition of generators and [how they work](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07246.html).)

### <span id="Platform_Fixes">Platform Fixes</span>

Win32 has had more work done on it; in particular, the continual makefile problems. LP64 environments, such as 64-bit Solaris and Tru64, also received a much-needed fix, allowing them to finally work.

### <span id="Signed_vs_Unsigned">Signed vs. Unsigned</span>

A huge signed-to-unsigned migration was finally begun. Somewhere between the original design and the initial code, the use of an unsigned partner to INTVAL (The Type Formerly Known As IV) was dropped. It's now been reintroduced, and implicitly unsigned values are slowly being converted.

### <span id="Strings">Strings</span>

There were a lot of cleanup and additions made to string support in Parrot. There was a mild discussion on being able to [dereference](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07307.html) a stringified address.

### <span id="Fixed_sized_Output_Records">Fixed-sized Output Records</span>

The language list received a [question](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08840.html) from Tzadik Vanderhood, asking if a fixed-sized output record will be allowed, in line with its input record counterpart: `$/ =\80;`.

Aaron Sherman gave a [good response](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08841.html).

### <span id="Parroty_Bits">Parroty Bits</span>

The [Perl Development Grant Fund](http://donate.perl-foundation.org) creeped up to 26%.
