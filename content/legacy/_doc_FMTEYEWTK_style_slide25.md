-   Using a variable to contain the name of another variable always suggests that perhaps someone doesn't understand hashes very well. While you could write this:

            $name = "fred";
            $$name{WIFE} = "wilma";     # set %fred

            $name = "barney";           # set %barney
            $$name{WIFE} = "betty";

    Better to write:

            $folks{"fred"}  {WIFE} = "wilma";
            $folks{"barney"}{WIFE} = "betty";
