Happy Birthday Perl 5
=====================

The first full release of Perl 5 was exactly five years ago, on 17 October, 1994. (Not 18 October as `perlhist` says.) Happy birthday, Perl, and congratulations to Larry and the cast of thousands!

Oh, and if you're still running Perl 4, this might be a good time to consider upgrading.
