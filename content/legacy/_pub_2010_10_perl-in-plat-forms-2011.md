Thanks to [Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ](https://metacpan.org/author/DAXIM) for sending along this notice about the [Plat\_Forms 2011 web development contest](https://www.plat-forms.org/). Unlike other comparisons of programming languages (such as [the great unmaintainable speed-tweakers micromeasurement contest](https://salsa.debian.org/benchmarksgame-team/archive-alioth-benchmarksgame) and This Is Odiously Bad Empiricism), Plat\_Forms features real teams of real programmers performing real work.

Perl 5 can compete very well in this contest, with great web frameworks such as (but not limited to) Catalyst, Dancer, Mojolicious, and Jifty. See the [Plat\_Forms 2011 overview](https://www.plat-forms.org/platforms-announcement#overview) and [Plat\_Forms 2011 on the Perl 5 Wiki](https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/events_2011_plat_forms) for more details.
