[The Perl Conference](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc/) in North America (TPC::NA::2018) is almost here! We’re returning to Salt Lake City, Utah this year at the Little America Hotel once again. The conference is next month from Monday, June 18th through Wednesday, June 20th, with additional in-depth tutorial days June 17th, 21st, and 22nd. Tickets are available for sale on [the conference's Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-perl-conference-in-salt-lake-city-2018-tickets-41850611305).

The conference venue offers amazing views, but there is so much more to explore if you have time to check the area out. There are some famous attractions nearby like the [National History Museum of Utah](https://nhmu.utah.edu), [City Creek Center](https://www.shopcitycreekcenter.com), [Red Butte Garden and Arboretum](https://www.redbuttegarden.org), and [Temple Square](https://www.templesquare.com).
