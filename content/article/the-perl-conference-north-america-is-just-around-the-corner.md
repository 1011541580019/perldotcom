The Perl Conference in North America (TPC::NA::2018) is almost here! We’re returning to Salt Lake City, Utah this year at the Little America Hotel once again. The conference is next month from Monday, June 18th through Wednesday, June 20th, with additional in-depth tutorial days June 17th, 21st, and 22nd. Tickets are available for sale on the conference [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-perl-conference-in-salt-lake-city-2018-tickets-41850611305).

The conference venue offers amazing views, but there is so much more to explore if you have time to check the area out. There are some famous attractions nearby like the National History Museum of Utah, City Creek Center, Red Butte Garden and Arboretum and Temple Square. You can find out more information about these attractions and Salt Lake City at [visitutah.com](https://www.visitutah.com).

TPC::NA::2018 offers a variety of topics and speakers intended for beginners through advanced attendees. Learn about Perl’s Higher Order Functions in David Golden’s presentation Taking Perl to Eleven with Higher-Order Functions. Explore the future of Perl 5 with Sawyer X in Perl 5.28 and Beyond. Speaker Matt Trout will tell you about extending and transforming Perl in his Tower of Babble session, while Michael Conrad pops open the hood in his Building the Graphics of the DeLorean Digital Dash presentation. There’s a lot to learn and more to see, visit the full session list on the TPC::NA::2018 [website](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc/sessions/).

There are also 3 dedicated days of tutorial sessions surrounding the main conference event days. Dave Rolsky has courses on Go and Moose while Elizabeth Mattjsen will help you make a Perl 5 module for use in Rakudo Perl 6. The full course list and prices are available [here](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc/tutorials/). After purchasing a separate ticket to any one of these sessions, you can get hands-on training in half or full day lessons from Perl experts.

From the organizers of TPC::NA::2018, we are really looking forward to seeing you next month!
