For more information on the Perl 6 and Parrot development efforts, visit
[dev.perl.org](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/) and
[parrotcode.org](http://www.parrotcode.org/).

There were 224 messages across 114 threads, with 39 authors
contributing. Most of the messages were patches.

### [Regexes]{#Regexes}

Parrot now has [primitive regex
support](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07641.html),
courtesy of Brent Dax. It includes a set of regex op primitives,
including hooks for a [generic regex
compiler](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07767.html).
Currently, however, there's some
[debate](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07738.html)
over where `match` should be implemented.

### [Naming Conventions]{#Naming_Conventions}

One of the larger threads discussed getting a handle on the current
naming convention. Or, more accurately, the [lack of
one](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07696.html).
No consensus has been reached.

### [Warnings]{#Warnings}

The Parrot community received a well-deserved [slap on the
wrist](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07756.html)
from Parrot hacker Nicholas Clark. A common complaint on checking out
our code is the incessant stream of warnings when compiling. You're not
alone.

### [Parroty Bits]{#Parroty_Bits}

Dan Sugalski
[posted](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07627.html)
some more random thoughts on Parrot's implementation direction. He also
started on the new [memory
allocator](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07729.html),
and modified `life.pasm` to be a new
[benchmark](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07703.html).

David M. Lloyd fixed a some problems that exist when the size of an
opcode is smaller than the configured size of an integer value. (A
perfectly legal scenario in Parrot.)

Simon Glover also did significant hacking on arrays and hashes.

The [Perl Development Grant Fund](http://donate.perl-foundation.org) is
holding steady at 26% (and change).
