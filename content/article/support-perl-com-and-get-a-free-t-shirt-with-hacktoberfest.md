Hacktoberfest 2018 is here! Throughout October if you open 5 pull requests to public GitHub repos, including the Perl.com [repo](https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom), you'll be eligible for a free t-shirt. New swag aside, you'll also be helping open source projects, and building your tech résumé.

To enter register your Github account at the Hacktoberfest [website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). If you want to support Perl.com, or are looking for inspiration, we have a bunch of open [issues](https://github.com/tpf/perldotcom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) that we'd love help with.
