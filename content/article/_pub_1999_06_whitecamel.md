  **Coming soon --** our nomination form for the first White Camel Awards. Let us know who you think has made outstanding contributions to Perl Advocacy, Perl User Groups, and the Perl Community.\
  The White Camel awards will be presented at [Perl Conference 3.0](http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl3/) on August 24, 1999, during the Town Meeting.

SEBASTOPOL, CA--The rare white camel, prized by desert-dwellers, is the
inspiration for a new award recognizing the Perl community's "unsung
heroes"--those who have devoted extraordinary creativity, energy, and
time to the non-technical work that supports Perl's active and loyal
user community. The White Camel awards will be presented to individuals
who have made outstanding contributions to Perl Advocacy, Perl User
Groups, and the Perl Community at O'Reilly's Perl Conference 3.0 on
August 24, 1999. The camel has come to symbolize Perl since it first
appeared on the cover of O'Reilly & Associates' classic "Programming
Perl" in 1991.

Perl Mongers (<http://www.pm.org>), a not-for-profit organization whose
mission is to establish Perl user groups, conceived of and will
administer the White Camel awards. Perl users will be able to nominate
people for the awards at [http://www.perl.com/whitecamel](/whitecamel)
after July 8. The awards are sponsored by Perl Mongers, O'Reilly &
Associates, and sourceXchange (<http://www.sourceXchange.com>), a
web-based marketplace for Open Source development.

"Perl's user community has had a huge role in its adoption and ongoing
development," said Madeline Schnapp, O'Reilly's Perl Product Manager.
"With a marketing budget of zero, the community has championed a
technology that has greater market share than its well-funded
proprietary competitors. We're delighted that the Perl Mongers initiated
the White Camel awards, and we're proud to sponsor them."
