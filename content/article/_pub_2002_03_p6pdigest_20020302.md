### [Notes]{#Notes}

Both the email subscription and the web archive are temporarily offline.
This should be remedied shortly. In the meantime, please send additions,
submissions, corrections, kudos, and complaints to
<bwarnock@capita.com>.

Perl 6 is the major redesign and rewrite of the Perl language. Parrot is
the virtual machine that Perl 6 (and other languages) will be written
for. For more information on the Perl 6 and Parrot development efforts,
visit [dev.perl.org](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/) and
[parrotcode.org](http://www.parrotcode.org/).

For the three week period, there were 423 messages across 128 threads,
with 61 authors contributing. About half the threads were patch related.
Few of the remaining threads have little meaning outside the active
development circle, so there's little of interest to report on.

### [Topicalizers]{#Topicalizers}

There was a fair amount of discussion, however, on
[perl6-language](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org)
about topicalizers in Perl 6. (Topicalizers are the lexically scoped
aliases in `foreach` iterators and the new `given` block.)

Allison Randal
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg09165.html):

Larry Wall
[replied](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg09170.html):

Much of the subsequent thread discussed whether `when` should refer to
[`$_`](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg09200.html)
or the topicalizer bound to by
[`given`](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg09202.html).

### [Garbage Collecting]{#Garbage_Collecting}

Dan Sugalski committed his garbage collector framework, including
[built-in](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08741.html)
statistical generation. (As inspired by some [horrendous
performance](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08723.html)
early on.) The good news is that the performance problems have been
cleared up. The bad news is that the garbage collector still doesn't
collect garbage.

### [.NET CLR and Parrot]{#NET_CLR_and_Parrot}

Simon Cozens
[submitted](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08641.html)
a lot of information on .NET. Even for the non-Parroteers, this is a
good read.

### [PDDs]{#PDDs}

Simon also
[reminded](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08519.html)
folks that there are Design Documents to write. He then submitted the
[Keys and
Indices](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08523.html)
PDD. Brent Dax followed up with the [Regular
Expression](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08528.html)
PDD, and Dave Mitchell's [Coding
Standards](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08555.html)
PDD was finally committed. Alex Gough contributed a [Big
Number](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08618.html)
PDD, while Bryan Warnock fixed some gaping holes in the
[PDD](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08677.html)
PDD. There's also a PDD for the assembler and the bytecode format on the
way.

### [Parrot Magic Cookie Assignments]{#Parrot_Magic_Cookie_Assignments}

Dan Sugalski
[clarified](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg08446.html)
how PMC assignments should work. Most of the subsequent discussion was
attempting to mesh Dan's answers with typing, both weak and strong.

### [The Parrot Spotlight]{#The_Parrot_Spotlight}

[Brent Dax](http://brentdax.perlmonk.org) is a sixteen-year-old high
school junior. He lives in Southern California with his parents, a
brother and sister, and a pet cat.

Brent works on a lot of stuff within Parrot. He has worked on the
Configure system, the regular expression engine, the embedding
interface, warnings, and formatted printing. He has two modules on the
CPAN, both related to Perl 6. When he's not hacking on Parrot, a Perl
script, or some other little project, he's probably handling
[e-mail](mailto:brentdax@cpan.org), reading a book, doing homework, or
watching CNN. He's sometimes on PerlMonks, and can usually be found on
the developer's IRC channel `#parrot`.
