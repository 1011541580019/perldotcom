\
All--

Welcome to another Perl 6 summary, brought to you by microwaved Chinese
food and air conditioning. I love the modern era. Without further ado, I
bring you:

### Perl 6 Compilers

#### [PxPerl](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/72ef8db2a30decff/d6cdda584ed03036#d6cdda584ed03036)

Grégoire Péan announced the release of PxPerl 5.8.7-3, allowing easy
access for people who want to play with Pugs and Parrot on Windows.

#### [Test Report for Windows](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/59cbdc5407af6d1d/b5fab8f688683f68#b5fab8f688683f68)

Ronald Hill reported some failing tests for Pugs on Windows.
Fortunately, given Pugs' development, there is a reasonable chance of
having these problems fixed. Unfortunately, given Pugs' development, no
such information made it to the list.

#### [Parsing Perl 6 Rules](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/b015b73040e20441/1468fa0cd2c60b47#1468fa0cd2c60b47)

Nathan Gray wondered how Jeff Pinyan's parsing-Perl-6-rules project was
going. Jeff said that it did not get very far, but he posted what he did
have to [his feather site](http://feather.perl6.nl/~japhy/).

#### [Pugs Problems](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/82ee149bb2d85bc1/4d1fcdb883424696#4d1fcdb883424696)

Vadim Konovalov found two problems while playing with `slurp`. Adriano
Ferreira showed him how to work around `slurp` not accepting a `:raw`
option. Nobody commented on the peculiar `$*ARGS[0]` value when the
argument is `-foobarfluffy`.

#### [Official Perl 6 Rules Grammar](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/0011d8b97dee7e89/55fb939f0dee60c2#55fb939f0dee60c2)

Patrick announced an "official Perl 6 grammar," which he will maintain
closely with PGE in Parrot. It is incomplete at this point, but patches
are most welcome.

#### [PIL Nodes Descriptions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/e044f2bf561fe482/6bd06c83cd64f720#6bd06c83cd64f720)

Allison Randal posted a request for a clue batting, listing various
types of nodes in PIL and explaining her guesses at their descriptions.
Stuart Cook and Patrick both provided a little help, although they did
not address everything on her list.

#### [Perl 6 FAQ Patch](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/e390005d62b36314/1f78076fe32525de#1f78076fe32525de)

Autrijus provided a patch for the Perl 6 FAQ to remove an outdated
question. Robert Spier applied the patch (modulo some confusion about
staged versus live copies).

### Parrot

#### [Opcode Optimizability](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9d51af690526ca50/7ce11972f9700fc4#7ce11972f9700fc4)

Curtis Rawls noted that it is often simpler from an optimizer writer's
standpoint to do constant folding and optimization on a smaller set of
opcodes (just one variant of `add` instead of five (seven, if you count
`inc` and `dec`)). Leo explained that removing these opcodes isn't an
option, but suggest to add to the FAQ the recommendation for compiler
writers to emit only the more verbose codes.

#### [Refcounting Hash](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5c57948de0eb65d5/4524a529265756a1#4524a529265756a1)

Nicholas Clark wants to use a hash to hold reference counts for Ponie
(something like `dod_register_pmc` in *pmc.c*), but he doesn't want to
duplicate code. Leo suggested that he move some of the code into a PMC
and then switch the real registry to use that PMC.

#### [New PGE Test](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/64c78fe69846258d/5be1667694bf333b#5be1667694bf333b)

Mitchell N. Charity submitted a test for a "large" Pugs grammar. It
currently fails. Patrick noted that the test likely came from
*rx\_grammar.pl* in the Pugs distribution. This probably led to his
above addition of an "Official Perl 6 Rules Grammar."

#### [JIT Emit Help](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/be7db5a4fa863bf4/e0016e90bd49ac12?utoken=2ft0QzcAAADWXQ4sS--whFjzzhFxvEM00gQo7AZl4XkybyOr3FDcx1wpJJKp5Fy_CeG7_g7HuOvyH7OCrUDUWaccdqfgXNOG)

Adam Preble decided that he would play with an x86\_64 code generator.
Unfortunately, he hit some stumbling blocks. Leo offered to help him and
provided pointers from *\#parrot*.

#### [Call Opcode Cleanup](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/84a72c2aaf83c847/d2efb9430a077b30#d2efb9430a077b30)

Leo wants to clean up some of the various `invoke` opcodes. He posted a
request for comment, but Warnock applies. It seems that Leo's requests
for comments like this get Warnocked a lot.

#### [`spawnw` Return Value](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b3b8c5aecdcc2354/759b9235518ec3e9#759b9235518ec3e9)

Prompted by Jonathan Worthington submitting a patch to [make the
`spawnw` tests pass on
Windows](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/efb75561665e2c80/bb36e3935b3179ad#bb36e3935b3179ad)
(applied), Jerry Gay opened a TODO ticket for switching `spawnw` to
return something object-like to wrap platform-specific oddities.

#### [Bugs in *ops2vim.pl*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1791b6c68817f702/6ba2941807f35823#6ba2941807f35823)

Amir Karger noticed a bug in *ops2vim.pl* and suggested a fix. Jerry Gay
fixed it.

#### [Leo's Ctx Branch Tests](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3a36357193751b7c/f08ee194474ddbfe#f08ee194474ddbfe)

Jerry Gay and Leo worked together to get his branch passing a few more
tests on Windows. Nick Glencross wondered if the Python dynclasses tests
were running, too. Jonathan Worthington explained that they were being
skipped for the moment.

#### [Raised by the Aliens](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5e7adae80c68ae2c/0702375e91fd82a8#0702375e91fd82a8)

Matt Diephouse was surprised to discover that you cannot use `addparent`
with a PMC for either argument. He suggested that either should work or
should have official documentation.

#### [Patches Accumulating](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/571902f4a4f653f2/9e8223e529f9ba66#9e8223e529f9ba66)

Leo requested that people with commit bits pick up some of the patches
that were building up, as he was running a little low on tuits.

#### [Dump CFG](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6ef439c886066b14/55e991eba8cdcd52#55e991eba8cdcd52)

Curtis Rawls moved the `dump_cfg` call from *reg\_alloc.c* to *cfg.c*.
Leo applied the patch.

#### [`string_to_cstring` Leaks](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f1a4315013d4c915/672164862ef435bc#672164862ef435bc)

Jonathan Worthington plugged a few leaks caused by `string_to_cstring`.
Leo applied the patch.

#### [Deleting Globals/Lexicals](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e21b573a0ea70bde/65f90008008e2c3c#65f90008008e2c3c)

Matt Diephouse noted that there was no way to delete globals or
lexicals. Leo posted one (untested) way to do it.

#### [Generating Win32 Executables](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6854673d53122c92/607b7bf7c9e361c8#607b7bf7c9e361c8)

Jonathan Worthington laid some groundwork for generating executables on
Windows. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Library Loading on Win32](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f047dcf93759ecab/6e03ce901bb57ca5#6e03ce901bb57ca5)

Jonathan Worthington beefed up the library searching logic in Parrot to
be a little more Windowsy. Leo applied the patch.

#### [PBC Merge Utility](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8b4e5b0f87adba1d/57ed94ccb95085f8#57ed94ccb95085f8)

Leo posted a request for a utility that could merge several PBC files
into one.

#### [Calling Super Methods](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2bf16c7f57ee1a2e/59ec396d410b5d29#59ec396d410b5d29)

Matt Diephouse noticed that there was no way to call the method from a
super class. Leo pointed out a way to do it by accessing the slots of
the parent directly.

#### [`cmd` Buffer Reallocation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3b01415e4da2325f/20c2be9a86a7a693#20c2be9a86a7a693)

Greg Bacon fixed a bug in the reallocation of the `cmd` buffer on Win32.
Jonathan Worthington applied the patch.

#### [`Data::Dump` (PGE)](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d819d5808bcfa1e3/0c0ef49282c078e7#0c0ef49282c078e7)

Will Coleda added a TODO for making PGE's match objects compatible with
`Data::Dumper`.

#### [`does Hash`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/57829b80613a030f/eba85e09e75dd15e#eba85e09e75dd15e)

Will Coleda wants `Data::Dumper` to check if an object `does` `Hash` or
`Array` and dump it thusly if it has no default `dump`.

#### [*rx.ops*'s Future](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5087777195497561/6f8550b9c3e177b1#6f8550b9c3e177b1)

Will Coleda wondered about the future of the rx ops. Brent "Dax"
Royal-Gordon, who wrote them, recons they are not long for this world.
He mentioned though that the intstacks and the bitmap handling code
might be worth saving.

#### [Debugger-List Breakpoints](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/caf85c11387a0550/d8343c914258b2f4#d8343c914258b2f4)

Will Coleda noticed that the debugger was not quite compatible with
Perl's. Leo replied that the debugger's whole command loop was a mess
that required a turn of the crank.

#### [`\u` Escape Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c5fec6e374846f70/ea379969e2c28c73#ea379969e2c28c73)

Will Coleda brought up an old ticket for some Unicode escape issues. Leo
asked for a test case.

#### [`string` -&gt; `int` Conversions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1460def887a4d5c6/2423989ff6a521de#2423989ff6a521de)

Matt Diephouse noticed that there are no opcode octal and hex
conversions. Leo suggested adding one of the form
`set Ix, Sy, Ibase # Ibase = 2..36`.

#### [Make `make languages` Failures Non-Fatal](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c471cd54c2f4d224/ef07478f722221f5#ef07478f722221f5)

Bernhard Schmalhofer suggested that `make languages` should not give up
after the first failure, but should instead build the remaining
languages.

#### [Dynclasses on Windows](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2bf0400fe7338eef/5e293e31dfb2e70c#5e293e31dfb2e70c)

Nick Glencross and Jonathan Worthington discussed how to make dynclasses
build on Windows.

#### [`Resizable*Array` Allocation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/292d52cb41823a62/7b5c88c024a74769#7b5c88c024a74769)

Matt Fowles submitted a patch making all the various `Resizeable*Array`
PMCs share their allocation strategy. Bernhard Schmalhofer applied the
patch.

#### [MMD Roundup: Take 2](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b1fb0985a8682d17/42a030138f39041a#42a030138f39041a)

Nicholas Clark attempted to de-Warnock a suggested change by Leo.
Unfortunately, his thoughts on the matter were, "This is really a call
for the designer to make, isn't it?" Leo suggested starting a
*WARNOCKED* file for these things. Will countered that adding it to the
DESIGN section in *docs/ROADMAP*, would mean that Chip needs only look
in one place.

#### [Parrot Failures on Mac OS X](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/522f18e94ff1e97b/607ed4ce47a5eab6#607ed4ce47a5eab6)

Nicholas Clark forwarded some failures on Mac OS X to the Parrot list
(from the Ponie one).

#### [Parrot Needs `STDERR`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e06edd0f30a68d33/a197458082a6d861#a197458082a6d861)

Nicholas Clark noticed that running Parrot with a closed `STDERR` makes
Parrot unhappy.

#### [GMC](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/4cd9e2926bc83d64/f8d878256d60c2a1#f8d878256d60c2a1)

Alexandre Buisse and many others have been talking about his Generation
Mark and Compact Garbage Collector. Plans are rapidly taking shape.

### Perl 6 Language

#### [User-Defined Context Behavior](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/43135a1d4f0bbfcc/80e0a74f25f015a0#80e0a74f25f015a0)

Ingo Blechschmidt wanted to know how to make his own custom class that
would act specially in list context. Thomas Sandlaß suggested
overloading `&infix:<=>`. Sadly, his answer doesn't seem to have made it
to Google Groups.

#### [Hash Creation with Duplicate Keys](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c073d7300ae39e81/bd1f191a0b4b4dd7#bd1f191a0b4b4dd7)

Ingo Blechschmidt noticed that in Perl 5 hash definitions, the rightmost
duplicate wins, whereas the leftmost wins in Perl 6. He wondered if this
was a bug or not. Luke explained that it was that way for named variable
bindings. Larry figured it should be that way *only* for named variable
binding. If Pugs has not done it yet, some brave soul could probably add
tests and find it implemented before they had finished committing.

#### [Tail Calls, Methods, and Currying](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6961593735eeb3dc/1b1408f6f11c2504#1b1408f6f11c2504)

Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon wondered about tail calls, noting that the
current method (`$obj.can('meth').goto($obj, *@args);`) is kinda ugly.
Larry mused that `return g()` should go ahead and tail call. If the code
does not want a tailcall there, then it should avoid it manually.

#### [Pairs and Binding Play Poorly Together](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0e070011c30ef520/b9aafc0d0d0e27c7#b9aafc0d0d0e27c7)

Autrijus noted that pairs and bindings (such as in a `for` loop) play
badly together. Larry supposed that the `Bare` code object could have
parameters of type `Pair|Item` (note no `Junction`) by default to solve
this problem. Damian supported the exclusion of `Junction`.

#### [Method Introspection and Meta `meta.classes`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b64f6f0757aba82f/e7c6e6b4fde0dd38#e7c6e6b4fde0dd38)

Chromatic wondered about subroutine and method introspection. Sam Vilain
thought he might want to look at Stevan Little's Perl 6 MetaModel. He
also talked about closing the loop on meta-meta-meta headaches.
Apparently Smalltalk has done this somewhere.

#### [Big Object Rethink](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/69ce157a34ae688d/50c133e45c608ede#50c133e45c608ede)

Larry posted a fairly major rethink of member variables and methods.
Honestly I did not quite follow what he described, and there is a lot to
summarize--Hey! Look over there! ::PUNT:: Nothing to see here, move
along.

#### [Garbage Collection API](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/087904100f8ba53c/fa49a0002e4742b9#fa49a0002e4742b9)

David Formosa (after being lightly chastized by an unknown summarizer)
started a new thread expanding on his desire for a GC API. I thought
there were replies to this, but they don't seem to have made it to
Google.

#### [Exposing the GC](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/419828b0fad1dcb8/3eb110889aa7bc0d#3eb110889aa7bc0d)

Piers Cawley thought that it might be useful to expose the GC to get an
array of all objects of a particular class. Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon
thought that the ability to get such an array would be useful, but that
it should merely be an implementation detail of whether an array of weak
refs or the GC or Harry Potter was invoked.
