It was a busy week in the Perl 6 community with 363 messages contributed by 42 authors across 32 threads. A fourth of the threads comprised over three-fourths of the traffic.

### <span id="MY_Goodness">`%MY::` Goodness</span>

There were two huge discussions on the new `%MY::` interface to the lexical symbol table.

(70 posts) The major thread, [started](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08203.html) by Ken Fox, centered around `%MY::` as a language feature to be used and abused.

Most of the discussions addressed adjusting lexical variables during runtime, and what semantics that would change with what is currently Perl 5's lexical variables. Of particular concern, how runtime adjustment of lexical variables could defeat the current compile-time optimizations for variable resolution that Perl 5 currently enjoys, and whether `%MY::` symbol resolution is confined to a physical scope, whereas a lexical `$x` may refer to a lexical in an outer scope. These issues are being mulled over.

(45 posts) Brent Dax also [asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03501.html) whether `%MY::` should be a real symbol table instead of the current scratchpad structure currently used by Perl 5. There was a lot of debate on the differences between lexical and local global variables, and whether that distinction would help or hinder a transition to a true symbol table. Much of this decision will be affected by the linguistic questions discussed above.

### <span id="Prototypes">Prototypes</span>

(20 posts) I [proposed](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08188.html) a method for runtime prototype checking and value assignment that was generally accepted.

### <span id="Documents_Released">Documents Released</span>

(71 posts) Simon Cozens [released](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03519.html) an overview of the Parrot interpreter. This is mostly codifying and coalescing much of the information that has been presented before. Feedback has been rolled into the docs that will be provided with the first Parrot release, so you can catch the updated info there.

[Later stages](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03574.html) of the thread turned into a debate between Paolo Molaro and Dan Sugalski, centered once again around the decision to do a register-based virtual machine.

(5 posts) Dan Sugalski [re-released](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03666.html) the second version of PDD 6: Parrot Assembly Language.

(3 posts) Dave Storrs [released](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08250.html) the next version of his Perl 6 Debugger API PDD.

(16 posts) I released versions [one](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08165.html) and [two](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08269.html) of my "Statements and Blocks" language specification.

### <span id="Math_Functions_To_Add">Math Functions To Add</span>

(30 posts) Dan Sugalski [queried](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03681.html) the Perl community for math functions to add to Parrot.

### <span id="Parroty_Bits">Parroty Bits</span>

By the time you read this, the initial Parrot baseline should be available via anonymous CVS. You may find details [here](http://dev.perl.org/cvs). Simon Cozens holds the source pumpkin.
