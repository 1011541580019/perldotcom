Welcome to yet another fortnight summary. Lately, p6l has outstripped
p6i in volume. While this used to be the norm, it has become a rare
occurrence. Strange. Anyway, this summary would be brought to you by
cookies, but I ate them all. So instead this summary is brought to you
by the remaining chocolate chips. In other news, Autrijus Tang has just
officially received a promotion to first-name-only status in these
summaries, based on both his stellar work with Pugs and his highly
identifiable name. He now joins the ranks of Larry, Dan, Madonna, and
Leo.

### Perl 6 Language

#### [`do { } while?`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c9f1db8d113c08d7/027f23343c652443?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#027f23343c652443)

David Storrs wanted to know the best way to say `do { } while($foo);`.
Larry told him that `s/do/loop/` would suffice.

#### [`nest` as a Primitive Looping Operation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/32db8717ba0e550d/ac779781875c86f0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#ac779781875c86f0)

Timothy Nelson receives credit for resurrecting the oldest thread I have
seen brought back recently. Over two years ago, he mentioned a powerful
looping structure that allowed for recursion. Now he has found a use for
it.

#### [Loop Entry](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b35c605369380b56/f4fa6b3ece451d3a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#f4fa6b3ece451d3a)

Joe Gottman wanted to execute a closure on every loop entrance, not upon
every iteration. He thought `ENTER` happened only once ever, but it
turns out that it will do what he wants.

#### [`pop %hash`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5b644ba7bf32ee8b/2ef0d824408271ad?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#2ef0d824408271ad)

Rod Adams wants to be able to pop a key value pair out of a hash. Others
wondered what to use it for. Someone mentioned an OrderedHash.

#### [Higher Order Operators](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/1a81badb5e7d23e1/3350855574037772?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#3350855574037772)

Timothy Nelson wanted meta-operators. Larry gave him the full Unicode
character set with which to define them. Tim was happy.

#### [None and Nor Delimiters](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f9fce475f19a5353/2b9ded586f3b69a4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#2b9ded586f3b69a4)

Thomas Sandlaß suggested using `\` as a none junction delimiter. He then
extended this idea to provide a logical nor, `\\`. Autrijus suggested
`!` for none. There was some argument about whether nor deserved such
Huffmanization. Also, I think that the difference between `//` and `\\`
would continually escape me. I have enough trouble writing code to deal
with Windows filesystems.

#### [Kudos to Autrijus](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9e827e4150cbb3b6/204b4e76d72484ed?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#204b4e76d72484ed)

Damian proudly welcomed Autrijus to the ranks of the last-nameless-ones.
He also lauded Autrijus' amazing work at forcing a lazy language to pull
a lazier one. I think we all agree.

#### [Containers vs. Object References](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2d48d854b9cbe1a8/6c319c910f835318?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6c319c910f835318)

Rod Adams wondered whether there was a litmus test that could determine
if something deserved its own sigil. The answer appears to be mostly
history. Larry suggested a simplistic way to create new sigils, although
it would not provide interpolation. I think a blessed method for
defining new sigils which do interpolate and provide some sort of type
constraint and context would be really nifty. Also I want a million
dollars in small, non-consecutive, unmarked bills. If you have either,
please mail it to me.

#### [Printing True](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a2a26b0100a72e7a/f34c506880675af8?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#f34c506880675af8)

Autrijus wondered about true and false. Are they just 1 and 0? \#t and
\#f? Larry answered `bool::true` and `bool::false`, but `true` and
`false` will suffice when there is no ambiguity.

#### [Quoted =&gt; LHS](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/8ce3c96d680b43fd/c95c3599e4ec1bb5?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#c95c3599e4ec1bb5)

Juerd wondered if `=>` auto-quotes its left hand side. It does.

#### [`"@" x 75 ~ $zap =?= ("@" x 75) ~ $zap`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ede7a284fa3de442/6846196d7b25e342?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6846196d7b25e342)

Juerd mistakenly thought that `~` bound more tightly than `x`. Only
unary `~` binds that tightly, so he is safe.

#### [Getting the key|value of a Pair](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/15b8cd859be7f54f/b6a226dcb9efa426?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b6a226dcb9efa426)

Steve Peters wondered how he could get the key or value from a pair. It
turns out that the `.key` and `.value` method does what he wants until
some twisted soul overrides them.

#### [Junctions and Auto-threading](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/868ab2f20deb00d8/1036a84d6d4f1bc7?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1036a84d6d4f1bc7)

By far the longest topic this week was junctions. Some people worry that
their auto-threaded behavior will cause plagues to ravage the earth and
novices programmers to go blind. Others feel that without it Perl 6 will
be a language suitable only to pond scum and cobol programmers. While
one side believes that auto-threading repetition of sid effects will
crash any database that interacts with Perl 6, the other side believes
that requiring extra pragmas to unlock their full power will prevent
junctions from curing cancer. Either way someone will be unhappy. It
looked like the pendulum was swinging towards auto-threading, but its
chief proponent will be away next week, so who knows if it can survive
undefended. My favorite suggestion in all of this was to make Perl 6 a
pure functional language and introduce monads.

#### [Nullary vs. Non-slurpy](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d794435fc53aeeb4/3d546e5dcdcbcbe9?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#3d546e5dcdcbcbe9)

Autrijus found it distressing that he had to make an empty signature
slurpy to make his quicksort sort quickly. Larry assured him that it was
okay. This also led to a question of MMD tie-breaking. Remember to
attach an `is default` if you want your ties broken!

#### [Pairs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/e375876af57e5ad7/17172a371838d9c7?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#17172a371838d9c7)

Steve Peters had a few more questions about pairs, which made Osfameron
notice that he could use pairs like Lisp's dotted pairs. Larry admitted
that he could and had hoped that no one would notice.

#### [Octal Strings](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3630972c1f5fe7c3/150340a8a903ede8?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#150340a8a903ede8)

Luke Palmer wondered which strings would change radix and to what. The
consensus was that something needed to change, but no one is sure what.

### Perl 6 Compilers

#### Pugs 6.0.8

Pugs continues to approach 2 \* π with the release of 6.0.5. Later
Autrijus decided that he should release more stuff and put out 6.0.8. It
has many new features and a much improved test suite. You should
contribute tests. All the cool people are.

-   [6.0.5](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/8edbef4e7c155c76/155ff69eab6c65ea?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#155ff69eab6c65ea)
-   [6.0.8](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/160da4b6afe8cff6/b7b6510ff0759f7e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b7b6510ff0759f7e)

#### [List of builtins](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/fd1eab71f4989384/c4121f7ec106c925?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#c4121f7ec106c925)

Autrijus wondered if there was a list of builtins anywhere. Patrick
pointed him to his start.

#### [Perl 6 Now](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/496f6f549a052253/67611a8b0bd750b5?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#67611a8b0bd750b5)

Autrijus wondered if the unit tests for Perl 6 Now were available. Scott
Walters told him that they were public domain. Autrijus gleefully sicced
a small, ugly dog on them.

#### Pugs tests

??? proved that he was cool by providing Pugs tests. So did Steve
Peters, Benjamin Smith, and Stevan Little. I bet you wish you were cool
too.

-   [???](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/cf1fb64a97586be3/3e1cb81a3e282bf4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#3e1cb81a3e282bf4)
-   [Steve](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/a02f28ad5a1a4109/781c0d6e092ad718?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#781c0d6e092ad718)
-   [Benjamin](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/ffb637727347a7ab/19f46916c942883e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#19f46916c942883)
-   [Stevan](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/83a37a5a08e90017/f4f98b978914173b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#f4f98b978914173)

#### [Pugscode.org](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/fda6e0e3d06d9b81/36168631eb11950d?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#36168631eb11950d)

Autrijus registered [pugscode.org](http://pugscode.org/) and populated
it.

#### [`%*ENV` in pugs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/fa51e00fc3e32be7/54d4a42ff2abd895?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#54d4a42ff2abd895)

Rafael Garcia-Suarez wanted access to `%*ENV`, so he added it with
tests.

### Parrot

#### [GNU R](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e0e9845d7619554f/797b41e7df0af799?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#797b41e7df0af799)

Yves Breitmoser wants to improve the support for GNU R in Perl. Aaron
Sherman suggested using Parrot as a back-end for Parrot, which would
allow any language that targets Parrot to use R.

#### [`make html`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6c14fd2b66c449d3/da930957ecaf740a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#da930957ecaf740a)

Markus Amslser submitted a patch to fix `make html`. Leo applied it.

#### [Win32 `bind(accept(listen()))`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f21946c947860f10/e3f73f70cc579f81?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e3f73f70cc579f81)

Markus Amslser submitted a patch adding `bind`, `listen`, and `accept`
on Win32. Leo applied it.

#### [Commit Privileges](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/4d8c764063f50446/743fe0d97af8fb20?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#743fe0d97af8fb20)

Bernhard Schmalhofer received commit privileges in recognition of his
many high quality patches. Congrats Bernhard!

#### [Tiny Webserver](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/28d2209f38dd22a8/1f3c3a31d79b71f7?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1f3c3a31d79b71f7)

Markus Amslser also provided a patch to allow his tiny webserver to run
on Linux. Leo applied it.

#### [FreeBSD Build Failure](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0249207572737092/dd04c9970791c4a0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#dd04c9970791c4a0)

Adriano Ferreira fixed some problems with the FreeBSD build. Leo applied
the patch.

#### [Parrot 0.1.2](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f3fab2ac907655ca/217c973cc03ce324?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#217c973cc03ce324)

Will Coleda continued pushing for a 0.1.2 release. Leo told him that
there would be a release after the German Perl Workshop, which should be
ending soon.

#### [Linux PPC](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/33d379077b32a52a/5b13e8374e061881?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#5b13e8374e061881)

Leo attempted to fix the longstanding issues with Linux PPC configure.

#### [Failing Python Tests](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e7aaad0dcfe9205c/f4b32479194a9920?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#f4b32479194a9920)

Andy Dougherty noticed failures on some of the `dynclasses/py*.t` tests.
He is working with Leo on providing enough information to solve the
problem.

#### [PyPy](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f27777feb08ea5aa/7a88d1ce65b07f90?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#7a88d1ce65b07f90)

Christian Tismer posted to the list informing everyone about the PyPy
sprint at Washington, DC's PyCon 2005. They are eager to compare notes
with other developers.

#### [`string_init` and ICU data dir](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/113ba6bba4850f21/37c99776d01d9c17?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#37c99776d01d9c17)

Ron Blaschke noticed that Parrot choked on an empty ICU data dir. Leo
fixed it.

#### Win32 Parrot

Ron Blaschke wants to improve Parrot building on Win32. He has offered
to add the necessary `PARROT_API` macros and do other footwork.

Bob Rogers wants to make tail calls without knowing the last call's
return values. Currently he just lies to IMCC to make it work. Leo
pointed him to `interpinfo .INTERPINFO_CURRENT_CONT` and also suggested
adding a `tail_call` op.
