Welcome to the tenth State of the Perl Onion. For those of you who are
unfamiliar with my methods, this is the annual speech wherein I ramble
on about various things that are only marginally related to the state of
Perl. I've gotten pretty good at rambling in my old age.

In the *Scientific American* that just came out, there's an article on
chess experts, written by an expert, on what makes experts so expert.
This expert claims that you can become an expert in just about anything
if you study it persistently for ten years or so. So, since this is my
tenth State of the Onion, maybe I'm about to become an expert in giving
strange talks. One can only hope (not).

Speaking of chess, how many of you recognize this?

Does this help?

This is, of course, the mnemonic for the old Linnean taxonomy of
biological classification.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x02.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Those of you who understand computers better than critters can think of
these as nested namespaces.

This is all about describing nature, so naturally, different languages
care about different levels.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x03.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

For instance, PHP isn't much into taxonomy, so everything in PHP is just
its own species in a flat namespace. Congratulations, this is your new
species name:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x04.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Ruby, of course, is interested primarily in Classes.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x05.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Python, as the "anti-Perl," is heavily invested in maintaining Order.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x06.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Now, you *might* be smart enough to program in Haskell if you've
received a MacArthur Genus award.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x07.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

... used to be I couldn't spell "genus," and now I are one ...

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x08.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Moving right along toward the other end of the spectrum, we have
JavaScript that kind of believes in Phyla without believing in Classes.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x09.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

And at the top of the heap, playing king of the mountain, we have
languages like C\# and Java. The kingdom of Java only has one species.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x10.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

The kingdom of C\# has many species, but they all look like C\#.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x11.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Well, that leaves us with families.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x12.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

I expect I have a pretty good excuse for thinking a lot about families
lately, and here is my excuse:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x13.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

This is Julian, my grandson. Julian, meet the open source hackers. Open
source hackers, meet Julian.

Many of you will remember my daughter Heidi from previous OSCONs. A
couple years ago she married Andy, and Julian is the result. I think
he's a keeper. Julian, I mean.

Well, and Andy too.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x14.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Andy obviously has his priorities straight. I would certainly recommend
him as a son-in-law to anyone. (Wait, that doesn't quite work ...)

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x15.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

There are many definitions of family, of course. Here's a mommy and a
daddy truck. They live on a truck farm, and raise little trucks.

Out in California, the word "family" keeps leaping out at me from
various signs. People use the word "family" in some really weird ways.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x16.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

There was a Family Fun Center, with a miniature golf course. I believe
that sign. At least for the golf. As a parent, I'm not sure the game
arcade is for the whole family. I'm an expert in staying out of loud
places.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x17.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

But the sign that said "Farmers Feed America--Family Water Alliance" ...
I suspect the word "family" is in there more for its PR value than
anything else.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x18.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

And, of course, "family planning" is for when you plan *not* to have a
family. Go figure.

All of my kids were unplanned, but that doesn't mean they were unwanted.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x19.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Many of you know that I have four kids, but in a strange way, I really
have five, if you count Perl.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x20.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Geneva thinks of Perl as more or less her twin sister, since they were
both born in 1987. But then, Geneva is strange.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x21.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Some people think Perl is strange too. That's okay--all my kids are a
little strange. They come by it naturally.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x22.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x23.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Here's a self-portrait of the other end of Geneva.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x24.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Here's what you usually see of Lewis.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x25.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Here's some of Aron, pulling the door that says "push."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x26.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

And here's Heidi.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x27.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

She always was a pale child.

Actually, here's the real picture.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x28.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

You can see she's actually quite sane. Compared to the rest of us.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x29.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Here's a picture of my wife Gloria.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x30.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Here's another picture of my wife. Well, her arms. The feet are my
mom's. Actually, this is *really* a picture of my granddog, Milo. He's
the one on the right.

I've talked before about how the stages in Perl's life are very much
like that of a kid. To review:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x31.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

This extended metaphor can be extended even further as necessary and
prudent. Actually, it's probably unnecessary and imprudent, but I'll
extend it anyway, because I find the metaphor useful. Perl, my fifth
child, is showing various signs that she is about to grow up, and as a
pseudo-parent, that makes me pseudo-proud of her. But there are other
ways the metaphor makes me happy. For instance, it gives me another
argument about the name of Perl 6.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x32.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

From time to time, people have suggested that Perl 6 is sufficiently
different from Perl 5 that she should be given a new name. But we don't
usually rename our kids when they grow up. They may choose to rename
themselves, of course. For the moment I think Perl would like her name
to stay Perl.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking: in anthropomorphizing Perl
this way, Larry has gone completely off the deep end. That's not
possible--I started out by jumping off the deep end, and I haven't
noticed the water getting any shallower lately.

But in justification of my metaphor, let me just say that when I say
"Perl" here, I'm not just talking about the language, but the entire
culture. There are a lot of people who worked hard to raise Perl up to
where she is today, and a bunch more people working hard to send her off
to college. It's the collective aspirations of those people that is the
real personality of Perl.

When we first announced the Perl 6 effort back in 2000, we said it would
be the community redesign of Perl. That continues to be the case today.
It may look like I'm making all these arbitrary decisions as the
language designer, but as with a teenager, you somehow end up making
most of your decisions consistent with what they want. With what the
Perl community wants, in this case.

If a teenager doesn't want to listen to you, you can't make 'em.

The fact is, Perl would be nothing without the people around her. Here's
a new acronym:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x33.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

or if you like:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x34.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

It really helps to have an extended family to raise a kid well. American
culture has been somewhat reductionist in this respect, but a lot of
other cultures around the world understand the importance of extended
family. Maybe it's just because Americans move around so much. But it's
a healthy trend that young people these days are manufacturing their own
extended families. At the church I go to, we call it "Doing Life
Together." Here in the extended Perl family, we're doing life together
too.

We have people in our family like Uncle Chip and Aunt Audrey. There's
Cousin Allison, and Cousin Ingy, and Cousin Uri, and our very own Evil
Brother Damian. I think Randal occasionally enjoys being the honorary
black sheep of the family, as it were.

It all kind of reminds me of the Addams family. Hmm.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x35.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

I watched *The Addams Family* a lot when I was young. Maybe you should
call me Gomez, and call Gloria, Morticia. I must confess that I do love
it when my wife speaks French. It gives me déjà vu all up and down my
spine.

It's okay for me to tell you that because I live in a fishbowl.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x36.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x37.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

I'm not sure who gets to be Lurch. Or Thing. Anybody wanna volunteer?
We're always looking for volunteers in the Perl community. Don't be
scared. The Addams family can be a little scary, and so can the Perl
family, but you'll notice we're also affectionate and accepting. In a
ghoulish sort of way.

We could take this TV family metaphor a lot further, but fortunately for
you I never watched the *Partridge Family* or *The Brady Bunch* or *All
in the Family* or *Father Knows Best*. Those of you who were here before
know I mostly watched *The Man From U.N.C.L.E.*

I also watched *Combat*, a World War II show. But I was kind of a
gruesome little kid that way.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x38.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

I like gruesome shows. Maybe that explains why I liked the Addams
family. Hmm. I once sat on the lap of the Santa Claus at Sears and asked
for all five toy machine guns listed in the Sears catalog that year. For
some reason I didn't get any of them. But I suppose my family loved me
in spite of my faults. My role models in parenting obviously didn't come
from TV. Or maybe they did. You know, that would explain a lot about how
my family turned out. In actual fact, the picture above is another
self-portrait done by my daughter Geneva.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x39.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Anyway, I love my own family, even if they're kind of peculiar at times.
Last month we were staying at a Motel 6 in Medford, Oregon. Gloria
kindly went off to fetch me a cup of coffee from the motel lobby, and
then she came to this door and stood there for a while wondering how to
pull the door open with her hands full. Then she realized that the door
must have been designed by someone who thinks there should be only one
obvious way to do it. Because, the fact is, you can either pull or push
this door, despite what it says. I suggested we should start marking
such pushmepullyu doors with a P\*. We obviously need more globs in real
life.

Anyway, back to my weird family--this summer as we were driving around,
we had a great literary discussion about how Tolstoy debunks the Great
Man theory of history in *War and Peace*. After discussing the
far-too-heavily overloaded namespace in Russian novels and the almost
complete absence of names in the *Tale of Genji*, we tried to decide if
the *Tale of Genji* was the first novel or not, and decided that it was
really the first soap opera. Of course, then there had to be a long
discussion of what really *was* the first novel--*Tale of Genji*,
*Madame Bovary*, or *Sense and Sensibility*. Then there's the first
romance, first mystery, first fantasy, first science fiction, first
modern novel, etc. One interesting fact we noted was that the first in a
genre almost always has to officially be some other genre too. For
example, the *Tale of Genji* was written in the existing form of
explication of some haiku. Transitional forms are important in
biological evolution as well, as one species learns to become another
species. That's why we explicitly allow people to program babytalk in
Perl. The only way to become smart is to be stupid first. Puts a new
spin on the Great Man theory of history.

So then, as we were driving we saw a cloud formation resembling Thomas
Jefferson, which led us to speculate on the Great Documents theory of
history. "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" brought up the Great Slogans
theory of history.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x40.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Back to Tolstoy: "Moscow didn't burn because Napoleon decided to burn
it. Moscow burned because it was made of wood." Those of you who
attended YAPC Chicago may recognize that as the Great Cow theory of
history. Or maybe the lantern was really kicked over by a camel, and
there was a coverup.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x41.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Anyway, back to the family again, presuming the house hasn't burned
down. They say that "A family is where, when you have to go there, they
have to take you in." Arguably, regardless of your viewpoint, many
people have been, um, taken in by Perl culture.

Sorry. I have a low taste for taking people in with puns.

But hey, taking people in is good. And stray kitties.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x42.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Some families just naturally accumulate strays. My wife and I were both
fortunate enough to grow up in families that took in strays as a matter
of course. We have a number of honorary members of our own family. I
think a good family tends to Borg people who need to be taken in. It's a
lot like the way Audrey hands out commit bits to Pugs left and right. It
all one big happy hivemind. Er, I mean family.

Now, it's all well and good to get people in the door, but that's only
the beginning of accessibility. Whenever you get someone new in the
family, either by birth or by adoption, where do you go from there? You
have to raise your kids somehow, and they're all different. Raising
different kids requires different approaches, just like computer
problems do.

So, then, how do we raise a family according to the various computing
paradigms?

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x43.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Imperative programming is the *Father Knows Best* approach. It only
works at all when Father *does* know best, which is not all that often.
Often Mother knows "bester" than Father. Hi, Gloria. And a surprising
amount of the time, it's the kids who know "bestest."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x44.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

For some reason the Von Trapp family comes to mind. I guess you have to
structure your family to make the *Sound of Music* together.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x45.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

"Look, if you hit your sister, she *will* hit you back. Duh."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x46.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Obviously anyone who doesn't program their family functionally has a
dysfunctional family. But what does it mean to have a functional family?
"Being hit back is a function of whether you hit your sister." On the
surface, everything appears to be free of side effects. Certainly when I
tell my kids to mind their manners it often seems to have no lasting
effect. Really, though, it does, but in the typical family, there's a
lot of hidden state change wound in the call stack. We first learn lazy
evaluation in the family.

"Don't take the last piece of candy unless you really want it."\
"Please define whether you really care, and exactly how much you care."\
"I'm sure I care more than you do."

That's almost a direct quote from Heidi when she was young: "But I want
it more than you do."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x47.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Functional programming tends to merge into declarative programming in
general. I married into a family where you have to declare whether you
want the last piece of cheesecake, or you're unlikely to get it.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x48.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Unfortunately, I grew up in more of a culture where it was everyone's
responsibility to let someone else have the cheesecake. This algorithm
did not always terminate. After several rounds of, "No, you go ahead and
take it, no you take it, no you take it ..."

In the end, nobody was really sure who wanted the cheesecake. I guess
you say it was a form of starvation. But when I married into my wife's
family I found out that I definitely wouldn't get the cheesecake until I
learned to predeclare.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x49.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Let's see, inheritance is obviously important, or you wouldn't have a
family in the first place. On the other hand, the family is where
culture is handed down in the form of design patterns. A good model of
composition is important--a lot of the work of being a family consists
of just trying to stay in one spot together. As a form of composition,
we learn how to combine our traits constructively by playing various
roles in the family. Sometimes those are fixed roles built at family
composition time, and sometimes those are temporary roles that are mixed
in at run time. Delegation is also important. I frequently delegate to
my sons: "Lewis, take the trash out."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x50.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

That's Design By Contract. "Keep your promises, young man!"

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x51.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Metaprogramming. "Takes one to know one!"

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x52.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Aspected-oriented programming comes up when we teach our kids to
evaluate their methods in the broader context of society:

"Okay kid, now that you've passed your driver's test, you still have to
believe the stop signs, but when the speed limit sign says 65, what it
really means is that you should try to keep it under 70. Or when you're
in Los Angeles, under 80."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x53.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

But I think the basic Perl paradigm is "Whatever-oriented programming."

Your kid comes to you and says, "Can I borrow the car?"

You say: "*May* I borrow the car?"

They say: "Whatever ..."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x54.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Should I push the door or pull it?

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x55.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x56.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x57.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x58.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Actually, "whatever" is such an important concept that we built it into
Perl 6. This is read, "from one to whatever."

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x59.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

You might ask why we can't just say "from one to infinity":

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x60.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

The problem is that not all operators operate on numbers:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x61.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Not all operators are ranges. Here's the sibling argument operator,
which repeats the same words an arbitrary number of times:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x62.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Perl has always been about letting you care about the things you want to
care about, while not caring about the things you don't want to care
about, or that maybe you're not quite *ready* to care about yet. That's
how Perl achieves both its accessibility and its power. We've just baked
more of that "who cares?" philosophy into Perl 6.

A couple of years ago, Tim O'Reilly asked me what great problem Perl 6
was being designed to solve. This question always just sat in my brain
sideways because, apart from Perl 0, I have never thought of Perl as the
solution to any one particular problem. If there's a particular problem
that Perl is trying to solve, it's the basic fact that all programming
languages suck. Sort of the concept of original sin, applied to
programming languages.

As parents, to the extent that we can influence the design of our kids,
we design our kids to be creative, not to solve a particular problem.
About as close as we get to that is to hope the kid takes over the
family business, and we all know how often that sort of coercion works.

No, instead, we design our kids to be ready to solve problems, by
helping them learn to be creative, to be socially aware, to know how to
use tools, and maybe even how to manufacture the tools for living when
they're missing. They should be prepared to do ... whatever.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x63.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Trouble is, it takes a long time to make an adult, on the order of 20
years. Most insects don't take 20 years to mature.

Apparently it takes you ten years to become an expert in being a kid,
and then another ten years to become an expert in *not* being a kid.
Some people never manage the second part at all, or have a strange idea
of adulthood. Some people think that adulthood is when you just bake all
your learning into hardware and don't learn anything new ever again,
except maybe a few baseball scores. That's an oversimplified view of
reality, much like building a hardwired Lisp machine. Neoteny is good in
moderation. We have to be lifelong learners to really be adults, I
think.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x64.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

No, adulthood is really more about mature judgment. I think an adult is
basically someone who knows when to care, and how to figure out when
they should care when they don't know offhand. A teenager is forever
caring about things the parents think are unimportant, and *not* caring
about things the parents think *are* important. Well, hopefully not
forever. That's the point. But it's certainly a long process, with both
kids and programming languages.

In computer science, it is said that premature optimization is the root
of all evil. The same is true in the family. In parenting terms, you
pick your battlefields, and learn not to care so much about secondary
objectives. If you can't modulate what you care about, you're not really
ready to parent a teenager. Teenagers have a way of finding your hot
buttons and pushing them just to distract you from the important issues.
So, don't get distracted.

There are elements of the Perl community that like to push our
collective hot buttons. Most of them go by the first name of Anonymous,
because they don't really want to stand up for their own opinions. The
naysayers could even be right: we may certainly fail in what we're
trying to do with Perl 6, but I'd just like to point out that only those
people who put their name behind their opinions are allowed to say "I
told you so." Anonymous cowards like the "told you so" part as long as
it doesn't include the "I." Anonymous cowards don't have an "I," by
definition.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x65.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Anyway, don't let the teenage trolls distract you from the real issues.

As parents we're setting up some minimum expectations for civilized
behavior. Perl should have good manners by default.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x66.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Perl should be wary of strangers.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x67.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

But Perl should be helpful to strangers.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x68.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

While we're working on their weaknesses, we also have to encourage our
kids to develop where they have strengths, even if that makes them not
like everyone else. It's okay to be a little weird.

Every kid is different. At least, all my kids are really different. From
each other, I mean. Well, and the other way too.

I guess my kids are all alike in one way. None of them is biddable.
They're all arguers and will happily debate the merits of any idea
presented to them whether it needs further discussion or not. They're
certainly unlikely to simply wander off to the slaughter with any
stranger that suggests it.

This is the natural result of letting them fight as siblings, with
supervision. It's inevitable that siblings will squabble. Your job as
parent is to make sure they fight fair. It helps a lot if the parents
have already learned how to fight fair. What I mean by fight fair is
that you fight about what you're fighting about--you don't fight the
other person. If you find yourself dragging all sorts of old baggage
into an argument, then you're fighting the person, you're not fighting
about something anymore. Nothing makes me happier as a parent than to
hear one of my kids make a logical argument at the same time as they're
completely pissed off.

If you teach your kids to argue effectively, they'll be resistant to
peer pressure. You can't be too careful here. There are a lotta computer
languages out there doing drugs. As a parent, you don't get into a
barricade situation and isolate your kids from the outside world
forever. Moving out and building other relationships is a natural
process, but it needs some supervision.

Perl is learning to care deeply about things like:

This final point is crucial, if you want to understand the state of Perl
today. Perl 6 is all about reconciling the supposedly irreconcilable.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x71.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Reconciling the seemingly irreconcilable is part of why Perl 6 taking so
long. We want to understand the various tensions that have surfaced as
people have tried to use and extend Perl 5. In fact, just as Perl 1 was
an attempt to digest Unix Culture down into something more coherent, you
can view Perl 6 as an attempt to digest CPAN down into something more
coherent. Here are some of the irreconcilables we run into when we do
that:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x72.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

OO brings us a world of choices:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x73.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Do we even have classes at all?

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x74.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

And if we do, how do they inherit and dispatch?

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x75.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Is our type system more general than our class system?

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x76.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Plus a grab bag of other issues:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x77.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

And finally, the biggie:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x78.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Reconciling these known conflicts is all well and good, but our goal as
a parent must be a bit larger than that.

Just as a child that leaves the house today will face unpredictable
challenges tomorrow, the programming languages of the future will have
to reconcile not only the conflicting ideas we know about today, but
also the conflicting ideas that we haven't even thought of yet.

We don't know how to do that. Nobody knows how to do that, because
nobody is smart enough. Some people pretend to be smart enough. That's
not something I care about.

Nevertheless, a lot of smart people are really excited about Perl 6
because, as we go about teaching Perl how to reconcile the current crop
of irreconcilables, we're also hoping to teach Perl strategies for how
to cope with future irreconcilables. It's our vision that Perl can learn
to care about what future generations will care about, and not to care
about what they don't care about.

That's pretty abstruse, I'll admit. Future-proofing your children is
hard. *Some* of us get excited by the long-term potential of our kids.
But it's also exciting when you see their day-to-day progress. And we've
make a lot of progress recently.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x79.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

In terms of Audrey's Perl 6 timeline, we're right at that spot where it
says "hack, hack, hack." In a year or so we'll be up here saying,
"What's the big deal?"

This is the year that Perl 6 will finally be bootstrapped in Perl 6, one
way or another. Actually, make that one way *and* another. There are
several approaches being pursued currently, in a kind of flooding
algorithm. One or another of those approaches is bound to work
eventually.

Now, anyone who has been following along at home knows that we never,
ever promise a delivery date for Perl 6. Nevertheless, I can point out
that many of us hope to have most of a Perl 6 parser written in Perl 6
by *this* Christmas. The only big question is which VM it will compile
down to first. There's a bit of a friendly race between the different
implementations, but that's healthy, since they're all aiming to support
the same language.

So one of the exciting things that happened very recently is that the
Pugs test suite was freed from its Haskell implementation and made
available for all the other implementations to test against. There are
already roughly 12,000 tests in the test suite, with more coming every
day. The Haskell implementation is, of course, the furthest along in
terms of passing tests, but the other approaches are already starting to
pass the various basic sanity tests, and as many of you know, getting
the first test to pass is already a large part of the work.

So the plan is for Perl 6 to run consistently on a number of platforms.
We suspect that eventually the Parrot platform is likely to be the most
efficient way to run Perl 6, and may well be the best way to achieve
interoperability with other dynamic languages, especially if Parrot can
be embedded whole in other platforms.

But the other virtual machines out there each have their own advantages.
The Haskell implementation may well turn out to be the most acceptable
to academia, and the best reference implementation for semantics, since
Haskell is so picky. JavaScript is already ubiquitous in the browsers.
There are various ideas for how to host Perl 6 on top of other VMs as
well. Whatever.

But the VM that works the best for Perl right now is, in fact, Perl 5.
We've already bootstrapped much of a Perl 5 compiler for Perl 6. Here's
a picture of the approach of layering Perl 6 on Perl 5.

Here in the middle we have the Great Moose theory of history.

Other stuff that's going on:

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x81.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

In addition to lots of testing and documentation projects, I'm very
happy that Sage La Torra is working on a P5-to-P6 translator for the
Google Summer of Code. Soon we'll be able to take Perl 5 code, translate
it to Perl 6, and then translate it back to Perl 5 to see how well we
did.

![](/images/_pub_2006_09_21_onion/x82.jpg){width="500" height="375"}

Another bootstrapping approach is to take our current Haskell codebase
and translate to Perl 6. That could be very important long term in
keeping all the various implementations in sync.

There are many, many other exciting things going on all the time. Hang
out on the mailing lists and on the IRC channels to find out more.

If you care.

Perl is growing up, but she's doing so in a healthy way, I think. Those
of us who are parents tend to try to discourage our kids from getting
married too young, because we know how much people change around their
twentieth year. Around the age of 19 or 20 is when we start that last
major rewiring of our brains to become adults. This year, Perl will be
19 going on 20. She's due for a brain rewiring.

In previous years, Perl was just trying to act grownup by ignoring her
past. This year, I'm happy to report that instead of just trying to act
grownup, Perl is going back and reintegrating her personality to include
the positive aspects of childhood and adolescence. I don't know where
Perl will go in the next ten or twenty years. It's my job to say, "I
don't care anymore," and kick her out of the house. She's a big girl
now, and she's becoming graceful and smart and wise, and she can just
decide her future for herself.

Whatever. Thanks for listening, and for learning to care, and for
learning to not care. Have a great conference! I don't care how!
