‚Ñû 4: Characters and their numbers
---------------------------------

Do you need to translate a codepoint to a character or a character to its codepoint? The `ord` and `chr` functions work transparently on all codepoints, not just on ASCII alone‚Äînor in fact, not even just on Unicode alone.

     # ASCII characters
     ord("A")
     chr(65)

     # characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane
     ord("Œ£")
     chr(0x3A3)

     # beyond the BMP
     ord("ùëõ")               # MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL N
     chr(0x1D45B)

     # beyond Unicode! (up to MAXINT)
     ord("\x{20_0000}")
     chr(0x20_0000)

(Remember to enable [the standard Perl Unicode preamble](/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-standard-preamble.html) to use UTF-8 in literal strings in your source code and to encode output properly.)
