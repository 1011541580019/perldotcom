All\~

Last week I asked for help identifying the source of a quotation. One
friendly soul suggested Alan J. Perlis, but could not find an actual
attribution. It did lead me to find a very applicable (and in my mind
funny) quote from Perlis, which I will now inflict upon you all, before
your regularly scheduled summary:

> When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need only
> say what I wish done," give him a lollipop. -- Alan J. Perlis

### Perl 6 Language

#### [`qq:i`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b0aad9939bb2367a/1f29abcbe56bfbfe?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1f29abcbe56bfbfe)

Jim Cromie wondered if there could be a `qq:i` which sometimes
interpolates and sometimes doesn't depending on whether the variable had
been previously defined. There was some discussion which led to the
conclusion that this was just asking for strange bugs.

#### [Getters and Setters](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/bdf375ee76730b63/5a9e80e5952d2d10?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#5a9e80e5952d2d10)

John Siracusa wanted to know if Perl 6 would allow one to expose a
member variable to the outside world, but then later intercept
assignments to it without actually having to switch to using getters and
setters in all of the code that uses the variable. The answer: yes, yes
you can.

#### [`<< foo >>`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/01d83e4f7124a967/fbcc955466c79c95?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#fbcc955466c79c95)

Richard Proctor asked if he could do `<<list of words>>`. Juerd pointed
out that someone had already asked this. Which brings us to the fine
point, ask not Larry for he will tell you both yes and no. Although in
this case I think he said "probably"...

#### [Flipflop Operator](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d099f2399629373a/e35a284b1e68a454?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e35a284b1e68a454)

Juerd wondered about the fate of the flipflop. Larry explained that
while it had lost the election it was still going to work hard for you
in the Senate. Err, that's not quite right, he said that "It's leaving
syntactically but not semantically.", but he hasn't specified the new
syntax...

#### [`Temp $var`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4f047f2247f84647/5341da569ccf67dd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#5341da569ccf67dd)

Alexey Trofimenko wanted to know whether `temp` would preserve or
destroy its old value. Larry is leaning toward the Perl 5 semantics of
destroying, I think.

#### [`State` vs. `My`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/878c8f7ddc47f6fd/b2febbdc269ea8e6?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b2febbdc269ea8e6)

Alexey Trofimenko wondered how much advice about optimizing Ruby also
applied to Perl. Unfortunately, he also misunderstood the `state`
specifier. The topic then quickly veered into what exactly `state` does.

#### [Specifying a Hash's Key Type](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0a68ecc0a9b5813b/6cceddfaac9b6a23?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%6&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6cceddfaac9b6a23%22)

Abhijit Mahabal wanted to know if he could specify a hash's key type.
The answer is yes, but the exact syntax seems to be worth a discussion.
Luke Palmer, in his Mathematician's rage, attempted to shoot down any
usage of Domain and Range, as they really should be Domain and Codomain.

[Wikipedia: range Range
(Mathematics)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_%28mathematics%29)

#### [Container Methods](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5795b160190bea66/975ca916a337f524?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#975ca916a337f524)

Ashley Winters wants to have syntax for calling a method on the
container object rather than the containee. Luke Palmer agreed that this
was problematic. Larry appears to be in no hurry to add more operators
for this one, yet.

#### [Slight Discrepancy Between Synopses](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/e831fbff7f4853f8/1e7c0a77327dbf88?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1e7c0a77327dbf88)

St√©phane Payrard pointed out a small issue in some Synopses. Larry
replied "oops".

#### Arrays, Lists, Iterators, Functions, Co-routines, Syntax

Many people suggested many things about the best thing to replace the
now missing `<>` op. I think Larry is leaning toward adding an undare
`=` op, which would do cool things. I don't thing anything is final yet.

[Iterators as
Functions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/cbb53159bcaed4a7/1169615c9bfdc0e2?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1169615c9bfdc0e2)

[Unary `=`
Talk](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/257b8e0bbed541a8/93e0c356ddf3afcd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#93e0c356ddf3afcd%22)

#### [Push/Pop/Pull/Monkey](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/257b8e0bbed541a8/93e0c356ddf3afcd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#93e0c356ddf3afcd)

Many folk voiced their dislike of shift and unshift. I must agree with
them, but they also suggested a great many alternatives, including
pull/put, get/unget, and even getting rid of push/pop. I must say that I
really dislike that last idea. Fortunately I am not alone. Currently we
are waiting for inspiration to strike.

#### [Topicalization](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/257b8e0bbed541a8/93e0c356ddf3afcd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#93e0c356ddf3afcd)

Someone noticed that `for` might override one's topic at undesired
times. Larry ruminated about ways to solve this.

#### [Required Whitespace](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/257b8e0bbed541a8/93e0c356ddf3afcd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%2Fthreads%3Fgvc%3D2%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#93e0c356ddf3afcd)

Rod Adams does not like inconsistent whitespace rules. Larry explained
why the existing rules really were consistent.

### Perl 6 Compilers

The lack of traffic on p6c has given me another space to abuse. You
should listen to "Soul Coughing." If you would like to join in the fun
of abusing p6c, you should submit tests. Nothing is more abusive then
stress testing. ;-)

### Parrot

#### [Tuning and Monitoring](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ab18b616e2a89b3b/6bedca9a038ed1d9?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6bedca9a038ed1d9)

Matt S asked how much support Parrot has for tuning and monitoring. This
week I exercise the awesome powers of the summarizer and invoke the
mighty Warnock's Dilemma.

#### [`IMCC Globals`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e6020b8ffabbad88/028cfc120dffd3a1?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#028cfc120dffd3a1)

Leo removed some IMCC globals. Nice work.

#### [Ensure Directories Exist First](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a69db424446d8783/b7e77e4177a5e0b7?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b7e77e4177a5e0b7)

Andy Dougherty fixed a problem with writing a file in a non-existent
directory. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Namespace-sub Invocation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7b48bde181d11a1a/5805eb2e5eb0bb02?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#5805eb2e5eb0bb02)

Last week Luke Palmer wanted to know about calling subs in namespaces. I
posted Leo's answer, but Dan does not like it. It should be a two-step
process: first fetch, then invoke.

#### [What Is an opcode?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9f4ab6159579062e/34d31c62a32b54be?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#34d31c62a32b54be)

Thomas Seiler attempted to clear up some perceived confusion about what
exactly an "opcode" is. No responses...

#### Lexicals, Continuations, and Register Allocations

Dan voiced a final word in this long-lived and lively thread, which
kicked off several children. Return Continuations (even once-promoted)
restore their registers.

[Dan's
Ruling](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3a61fe5e97d17389/0603ff13ca52f0ff?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#0603ff13ca52f0ff)

[The Long and Lively
Thread](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/214157bf29879710/4c15aa4a1f56c20a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#4c15aa4a1f56c20a)

#### [Keyword Arguments](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/092577189995ee1d/f22bdbb497de3975?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#f22bdbb497de3975)

Sam Ruby wondered how he ought to handle keyword arguments to functions.
Dan admitted that this is complex, and outlined the cheat he has been
contemplating. No one has either commented on or implemented it yet.

#### [What Is and Isn't Up for Grabs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/168d0efbd0cfc1f4/b594c3a38848d19a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b594c3a38848d19a)

Dan attempted to lay out clear rules as to what things he would
entertain until Parrot was functionally complete. Let's hope it sticks.

#### [AST + COMPILE\_IMMEDIATE == :-(](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/bea07c6bee8717aa/8a916b80e4dc4c20?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#8a916b80e4dc4c20)

Bernhard Schmalhofer provided a patch to fix some of the :-(. Leo
applied it.

#### [*t/dynclass/pybuiltin.t* Fails](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5b28ae722a86bc80/bc5bad4a9a843190?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#bc5bad4a9a843190)

Will added a BUG to RT for this.

#### [Benchmark Tests](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/59b554e4cd6200ca/6e273b614f34004a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6e273b614f34004a)

Justin DeVuyst submitted a patch, which fell through the cracks, to make
the benchmarks also be tests. Fortunately Matt Diephouse rescued it from
the cracks and Leo applied it.

#### [Too Many opcodes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a549937c1d815228/64547f8c695af32e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#64547f8c695af32e)

Leo voiced his opinion that there were too many opcodes and suggested a
scheme for cutting down on them. Dan corrected him that there were not
too many. Despite this surface disagreement, however, Dan addressed the
spirit of Leo's complaint. Thus, they can both be happy.

#### [C89 Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/98345a122be7a9e2/1bf9ebeca3e9fe3f?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1bf9ebeca3e9fe3f)

There was a little confusion about whether variable declarations could
follow code in C89. The answer is not.

#### [perlhash `iter` busted](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/acb11073ce7d12c2/b79d4f2f7409bbde?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b79d4f2f7409bbde)

Sam Ruby noticed that the perlhash `iter` did not work and submitted a
test case for it. Leo fixed it (and presumably applied the test).

#### [Warnings Cleanup](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/355b38da2a067793/4aec9b7ad3ac3aae?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#4aec9b7ad3ac3aae)

Garrett Rooney submitted a patch to fix some warnings. Leo applied it.

#### [Objects, Classes, Metaclasses, and MMD Dispatch](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/eb26d8206c8346d4/a59e8326a855b612?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#a59e8326a855b612)

Dan's attempt to spec out objects from last week led to some discussion
of MMD. Leo suggested an implementation. Silence reigned.

[More MMD
Stuff](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ebe0bd5533aa3655/2c13224380f7b64b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Bak+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#2c13224380f7b64b%22)

#### [More Tcl Stuff](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/98c099993a0ef979/873d4926bf1d80ef?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Bak+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#873d4926bf1d80ef%22)

Will added more new stuff to Tcl. Yay, Will!

#### [Internal Exception Clean Up](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7ebda933279848a8/9504b2207764af73?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#9504b2207764af73)

James deBoer submitted a patch that cleans up internal exception output.
Later he submitted a second, better version of the patch. Warnock
applies.

#### [Dynamic Evaluation of PAST](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/55da497e90c63c16/05d1c7ecf5d40021?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#05d1c7ecf5d40021)

Bernhard Schmalhofer submitted a patch to add support for PAST dynamic
evaluation. Leo applied it.

#### Inline Caching

Leo explained inline caches and why 19 out of 20 calls like them. This
led to his suggesting that some of the opcodes we have that take offsets
from strings are a premature optimization. This led to some discussion
about whether what he suggested was in Dan's earlier mandate.

[Inline
Caching](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/11bf7f5b99611372/a4b461185a77d149?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#a4b461185a77d149)

[Leo's
Suggestion](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thre%0Aad/824cae85acf178d8/ce8deb56f8b293b4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%%0A3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#ce8deb56f8b293b4)

#### [`help` Target in Make](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9df1f9c203964ebd/881f8aef14e5bd29?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#881f8aef14e5bd29)

Bernhard Schmalhofer (whose name makes me very thankful for copy and
paste) submitted a patch adding a new `help` target to
*parrot/docs/Makefile*. Will appied it.

#### Parrot and Strong Types

Cameron Zemek asked about supporting strongly typed languages on Parrot.
I confused strong-typing and static-typing, but fortunately Dan came to
the rescue with a good explanation. During the course of this thread,
people suggested both Haskell and Prolog on Parrot. I like them both, a
lot.

[Original

#### [Move *libnci.def* Out of Root Directory](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/40960c8b3e7d3f48/428b477f8cfdc896?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Bak+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#428b477f8cfdc896%22)

Mitchell ::mumble:: provided a patch to do the above some time ago. Will
rescued it and asked for a ruling. The ruling is that it should apply. I
don't know if anyone DID apply it, but someone should.

#### [Tru64 `cc`/`ld` Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e668cb261aade149/e04b3c73c582e4f4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e04b3c73c582e4f4)

Jarkko Hietaniemi posted a problem with building on Tru64. Sam Ruby
committed it.
