### <span id="The_Perl_Development_Grant_Fund">The Perl Development Grant Fund</span>

The [Perl Foundation](http://www.perl-foundation.org/) is raising money to sponsor Damian "Mr. Language" Conway and Dan "Mr. Internals" Sugalski. We're about a [quarter of the way](https://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node_id=305) there, so if you don't know what to do with the $25 you received from Aunt Bertha for Christmas, now you do.

### <span id="A_JIT_Compiler_for_Parrot">A JIT Compiler for Parrot</span>

Daniel Grunblatt has an [early JIT compiler](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07089.html) in CVS now. Although it currently works only under Linux x86, it's certainly an impressive demonstration.

### <span id="Perl_IO">Perl I/O</span>

Melvin Smith [asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07060.html) whether Nick Ing-Simmons Perl I/O layer was going to be used for Parrot. Given Dan's desire to support asynchronous I/O, there were several conflicting opinions. The final result, however, was that Melvin was going to [start from scratch](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07081.html), using Nick's Perl I/O code as a basis.

### <span id="MiniPerl">MiniPerl</span>

Jeff Goff has been [busy](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07048.html) with MiniPerl, one of the languages distributed with Parrot.

### <span id="Setline">Setline</span>

There was a brief [debate](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07083.html) about whether to inline or offline `setline` operations . An out-of-band index seems to be the current direction.

### <span id="Exporter">Exporter</span>

Brent Dax [posted](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08824.html) his thoughts on Perl 6's `Exporter` module. Michael Schwern [pitched in](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08831.html) his objections.

### <span id="Parroty_Bits">Parroty Bits</span>

The Perl and Parrot communities wish you and yours a happy and safe holiday season.
