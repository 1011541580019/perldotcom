O'Reilly Media, Inc. is rolling out a new syndication mechanism that
provides greater control over the content we publish online. You'll
notice some improvements immediately, such as better standards
compliance, graphical tiles accompanying article descriptions, and
enclosure support for podcatching applications. We've tested the new
feeds using a variety of popular newsreaders and aggregators, but we
realize that there may be a few bumps along the way. If you experience
problems, please don't hesitate to send mail to <webmaster@oreilly.com>.
Please include detail about your operating system and reader
applications. We also welcome your suggestions. Thank you for your
continued support of Perl.com.

The following URLs represent Perl.com's article and weblog content in a
variety of popular formats:

Atom 1.0
:   <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/feed/16>

RSS 1.0
:   <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/feed/16?format=rss1>

RSS 2.0
:   <http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/feed/16?format=rss2>

We will begin automatically redirecting the existing feeds to the new
feeds above, but we recommend that you update your feedreader's
subscription settings to ensure continuous and uninterrupted service.

Thanks,\
O'Reilly Media, Inc.'s Online Publishing Group
