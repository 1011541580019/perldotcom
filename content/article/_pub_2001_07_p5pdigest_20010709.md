Please send corrections and additions to
perl-thisweek-YYYYMM@simon-cozens.org where YYYYMM is the current year
and month. Changes and additions to the perl5-porters biographies are
particularly welcome.

This was a reasonably busy week, seeing just over 400 messages. I say
that every week, don't I?

### [No 5.8.0 Yet]{#No_580_Yet}

[Jarkko](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#HIETANIEMI)
sadly announced that 5.8.0 wasn't going to happen before the Perl
Conference, but 5.7.2 is imminent:

> I think it's time for me to give up the fantasy that 5.8.0 will happen
> before the Perl Conference. The stars just refuse to align properly,
> too many loose ends, too many delays, too many annoying mysterious
> little problems, too little testing of CPAN modules. Luckily, nothing
> is majorly broken, and I think that I've more or less achieved what I
> set out to do with Perl, so I still hope to be able wrap something up
> before TPC and call it 5.7.2 (it must happen next week or it will not
> happen), and soon after the conference put out the Release Candidate 1
> for 5.8.0, and then keep cracking the whip till we are happy with what
> we've got.

### [New Modules]{#New_Modules}

These aren't really very new, but they may have slipped through the net
and you haven't noticed them yet, and since they're interesting, you
might want to have a look...

`I18N::LangTags` detects and manipulates RFC3066 language tags;
`Locale::Maketext` is extremely useful for localizing text;
`Unicode::UCD` is a neat interface to the Unicode Character Database;
`Encode` is coming on strong, and can now read IBM ICU character tables;
Mark-Jason Dominus' `Memoize` module is now part of the core.

### [Numbers, numbers, numbers]{#Numbers_numbers_numbers}

Remember last week's weird Amdahl UTS bug, where [Nicholas
Clark](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#CLARK) was
convinced UTS C was doing a decrement statement twice? He found the
problem - the decrement statement shouldn't have been there at all...

This prompted him to find a bug in `grok_number`; this surprised me a
little, because I didn't know that `grok_number` even existed. All of
the useful, platform-independent code which deals with numeric
operations - casting between different sizes, converting binary, hex,
and octal numbers, recognising numbers in strings, and so on, has been
moved to `numeric.c`. Take a look at it, there's a load of handy stuff
in there.

Hal Morris, our UTS wizard, also pointed out some unpleasant casting
assumptions, which needed a patch:

> `UV_MAX` must NOT be defined as `(unsigned long){whatever}` for UTS,
> because then comparisons with double will not work correctly (there is
> no problem with `(unsigned)` typecasts, only with `(unsigned long)`)

`grok_number` again came in handy on QNX, when Norton Allen found that
`strtoul` wasn't setting `errno` correctly on overflow. It's sad when we
have to start reimplementing people's broken C libraries, but this is
the price of portability.

### [PerlIO considered evil]{#PerlIO_considered_evil}

[Ilya](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#ZACHAREVICH) found
a bug in PerlIO, then found another bug while attempting to demonstrate
it. The original bug was:

> The \*actual\* problem is that char-by-char input requires DUPLICATE
> pressing of ENTER key for this key to be seen by Perl. Debugging this
> problem (via Term::ReadKey test suite) shows the following logic:
>
> pp\_getc() calls is\_eof() which does getc/ungetc calls getc()
>
> \[BTW, I see no logic in this sequence of events.\]
>
> The problem is that ungetc() can't unget "\\n" if this \\n is the
> first char in the buffer, and quietly drops "\\n" to the floor.

Ilya had a lot of invective set aside for PerlIO, which we need not go
into. Needless to say, he did not provide an alternative implementation
of a multi-layered standard IO system as a patch. Or indeed any patch at
all.

Vadim Konovalov did provide a simple patch to clean something up, but
then [Andy](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#DOUGHERTY)
and [Nick](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#ING-SIMMONS)
both showed that it didn't help at all, the generated code being the
same and some compilers not being able to cope with lvalue casts, which
Nick had carefully removed and Vadim's patch reintroduced. Guess Nick
might actually know what he's doing after all.

### [Asynchronous Callbacks]{#Asynchronous_Callbacks}

David Lloyd asked how do safely do asynchronous callbacks from C to
Perl. Bejamin Stuhl suggested hacking the core to introduce some checks
during the inter-opcode `PERL_ASYNC_CHECK`, and suggested that Perl
5.8.x had a public way of registering inter-opcode callbacks. David
Lloyd replied that PHP/Zend already had this, and you could even
implement a signal checking add-on module without any core hacking. Paul
Johnson went one further, and suggested using a pluggable `runops`
routine. Surprisingly, this has actually been implemented but nobody
really knows about it; `Devel::Cover` apparently makes use of it. Of
course, the problem is that only one thing can use a custom op loop at a
time, so David suggested writing an XS module that allowed other modules
to add callbacks. I hope that happens.

Artur Bergman popped up and, predictably, suggested using ithreads.

### [Various]{#Various}

Rudi Farkas found a weird one on Win32 - on that platform,
executableness (the `-x` test) is determined by the filename being
examined. For instance, `foo.bat` is classed as executable, but
`foo.bar` is not, even if they contain exactly the same data. This
rather curious design decision leads to the fact that if you call `stat`
with a filename, the execute bit is set depending on the extension. If,
on the other hand, you call `fstat` with a filehandle, Windows can't
retrieve the filename and test the extension, so it silently sets the
execute bit to zero, no matter what it gets fed. This is Bad, and means
that `-x _` on Windows is unpredictable. Radi provided a suggested
workaround, but nobody cared enough about fixing something so obviously
braindead to produce a patch.

Mike Schwern fixed up `MakeMaker` to stop producing extraneous `-I...`s
when building extensions, and also found that the XS version of `Cwd`
won't do much good as a separate CPAN module, since it relies on the
core function `sv_getcwd`, which only appears in 5.7.1. Oops. Oh, and
speaking of `Cwd`, Ilya patched it up a bit for OS/2, while noting that
its results were untainted on that platform.

Ilya also fixed a glaring debugger bug (oh, the irony) prompting Jarkko
to lament the lack of a test suite. Robin fixed up a couple of weird,
weird bugs in `B::Deparse`.

Jonathan Stowe upgraded `pl2pm` to be warnings and strict clean. I'm not
sure why.

Philip Newton patched a score of typos. Norton Allen updated the QNX
documentation and provided a couple of other fixes.

Piers Cawley found something that looked like a bug in `SUPER::` but was
assured that it wasn't; Randal won the day with a reference to
Smalltalk.

Abhijit Menon-Sen (look out for this guy...) made `mkdir` warn if it was
given a non-octal literal, since that generally doesn't do what people
want, and after prompting from Gisle, did the same for `umask` and
`chmod`. Unfortunately, he forgot about constant folding...

Until next week I remain, your humble and obedient servant,
