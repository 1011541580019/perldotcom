This is yet another Perl 6 summary, documenting what has happened over on the perl6-internals (where Parrot, the virtual machine that will run Perl 6, is discussed) and perl6-language (where Perl 6 language design is discussed) mailing lists. Piers is off on holiday (snowboarding and parachuting, no doubt), so I will be your host for the next two weeks. A particularly average week, so let's start off with the perl6-internals list as usual.

### <span id="getting_started_guide">Getting started guide</span>

Erik Lechak offered to help write a getting started guide to Parrot - he thought (correctly) that there may be "a pressing need for a document helping newbie developers figure out how to get started".

Unfortunately, Erik isn't a big fan of POD and attempted to code up a better replacement. While POD may not be perfect, an awful lot of Parrot developers are also Perl developers and POD is simple and good enough for Parrot for now.

### <span id="debugger_debugged">Debugger debugged</span>

Juergen Boemmels noticed that hitting the Enter key in the Parrot debugger (pdb) caused a segfault and that this wasn't quite ideal behaviour. He provided a patch which ignored empty lines, and after a nudge from Aldo Calpini provided another patch which followed the suggested behaviour in `docs/debugger.pod`, instead repeating the last command entered.

### <span id="patch_master">Patch Master</span>

The main patcher these recent weeks has been Leopold Toetsch, and he kept it up this week as well. He provided patches to stop Parrot permanently allocating increasing amounts of memory, fix a parser error in imcc, add stats to life.p6 and more. In fact, so many patches that I have a feeling he'll get CVS write access soon ;-)

### <span id="new_allocator">New allocator</span>

Leopold had a play with plugging in the Doug Lea memory allocator, providing a patch to configure in support for the current Parrot malloc, the Doug Lea malloc, or ptmalloc in libc. He also attempted to plug in Perl 5's malloc and found similar speed results. Later on, he created a document to explain memory internals, continuing the recent trend for more docs.

### <span id="patches,_patches_everywhere">Patches, patches everywhere</span>

There have been a lot of pending patches recently, and Robert Spier prodded us about them and hopes to have an automated weekly email nudge too.

### <span id="library_name_collisions">Library name collisions</span>

Steve Fink reported a problem with library name collisions. For example, having `intlist.c` as well as `classes/intlist.c` and `key.c` as well as `classes/key.c`. Dan proposed a naming convention where classes start with a CL\_prefix, encodings with an EN\_ prefix and character set stuff with a CS\_prefix, although it looks like a simpler solution may be taken.

### <span id="core.ops_ate_my_(miniscule)_ram">core.ops ate my (miniscule) RAM</span>

David Chan is using an itty bitty box (Cyrix with 32 MB of RAM) and found that compiling Parrot failed due to lack of memory. Nicholas Clark reminded us that you can disable the (faster, but needs more memory to compile) computed goto core at configure time using `./Configure.pl --cgoto=0`.

### <span id="parrot_file_list">Parrot file list</span>

There are a great number of source files in the Parrot distribution and Mark Sparshatt gathered ideas for how to have a file list which explained what each actually does.

### <span id="interfaces">Interfaces</span>

Over in perl6-language, Michael Schwern was asked at a recent Java conference whether Perl 6 will support interfaces. He tried to describe a likely interface and raised some problems with interfaces. This spawned a huge thread about OO, interfaces, and some of the weirder OO languages. Do we enforce strict interfaces? Are some methods allowed to be optional?

One of the more interesting ideas would be to move from just using prototypes to using Design-By-Contract features: pre- and post-conditions and invariants. Dave Whipp seemed a big fan of the Eiffel model, where it is possible to rename methods in a derived class. There was lots of scary Perl 6 pseudocode including cars, MP3 players, birds, and wings.

A little later, Schwern came back and worried about enforcing interfaces on subclasses. One interesting approach is to follow Eiffel and only allow subclasses to weaken the preconditions or strengthen the postconditions of the parent. Weakening involves adding ORs, strengthening ANDs. (More Foo and Bar pseudocode. Oh, and apparently Schwern only has 2 toes).

There was a short sidetrack on having multiple versions of modules running at the same time, and Allison Randal informed us that it looks like the full name of classes will include their version number, ie `Acme::N-1.1`.

In fact, a lot of the discussion is a bit in the air: as Dan Sugalski pointed out, things like object attributes aren't until Apocalypse 12 and it may be a little early to worry about such things.

### <span id="subjectoriented_programming">Subject-Oriented Programming</span>

Schwern also asked about subject-oriented programming, which looked interesting but which he couldn't quite understand. Andy Wardley explained that all these "advanced" programming techniques are all attempting a clear separation of concerns, and went on to describe and give pointers to more info.

[http://groups.google.com/groups](http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20021001032202.GX3858%40ool-18b93024.dyn.optonline.net)

### <span id="matching">Matching</span>

Someone mysteriously known only as "Ed" *\[ Ed Pescho - Ed.\]* asked what the favoured syntax would be to match negative multi-byte strings in Perl 6. It wasn't entirely clear what the question was, but one thing is sure: the Perl 6 pattern matching engine will have a lot of scope for optimisation.

### <span id="in_brief">In brief</span>

Tim Bunce asked if there were any good tools for static code analysis around. None, apparently.

Brent Dax reminded Andy Dougherty and others about `/Parrot_v?sn?printf(_[sc])?/` in `misc.c` - a reimplementation of the printf functions for portability reasons.

Simon Glover added tests for the assign opcode.

It looks like Michael Lazzaro will be writing a list of issues with OO as well as a tutorial so that everyone is clear what exactly we are talking about.

Larry cringes every time someone says "Parens construct lists in Perl 6".

### <span id="who's_who_in_perl6">Who's Who in Perl6</span>

Once more we get to meet people involved in the development of Perl 6.

**<span id="item_who_are_you%3f">Who are you?</span>**
  
Simon Cozens

**<span id="item_what_do_you_do_for%2fwith_perl_6%3f">What do you do for/with Perl 6?</span>**
  
I was the Parrot pumpking up until 0.0.4, and wrote much of the PMC and string infrastructure. I then escaped to get a life, play more Go and be a nicer person.

As perl.com editor and occasional author, I pop in from time to time just to check on the correctness of things I'm writing about and make sure Parrot compiles on at least one platform I possess so I can test code for articles. Rumours of my return to development have been greatly exaggerated. :)

**<span id="item_where_are_you_coming_from%3f">Where are you coming from?</span>**
  
I'm not, I'm already here!

**<span id="item_when_do_you_think_perl_6_will_be_released%3f">When do you think Perl 6 will be released?</span>**
  
I don't think Perl 6 - as we understand it - ever will be released. How's that for a Delphic pronouncement?

**<span id="item_why_are_you_doing_this%3f">Why are you doing this?</span>**
  
Because I like food.

**<span id="item_you_have_5_words%2e_describe_yourself%2e">You have 5 words. Describe yourself.</span>**
  
Less vehemently obnoxious than before.

**<span id="item_do_you_have_anything_to_declare%3f">Do you have anything to declare?</span>**
  
Watch out for some surprises in the near future.
