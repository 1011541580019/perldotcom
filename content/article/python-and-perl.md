Perl and Python might be described as cousin languages. They both started life in the late 1980s and took different paths to solving some of the same problems. Which one you choose isn't necessarily a matter of which language is better (and by the site you're reading you know we have our own opinion on that) but which one better suits the context where you want to apply it.

The question you're probably asking is "Which one do I learn?". The answer is "Yes".

I don't write that flippantly. Sometimes people ask me which running shoes they should buy. I tell them I don't know. I like Asics. That doesn't mean that's a good shoe for them though. You have to run a bit in the shoes to see if your feet like them. Even then, I might not wear Asics for a particular sort of running. Oh, and which socks do I think they should get? That's a harder question I don't even try to answer.

You should learn both, and then some other languages too. You don't have to keep using both of them but either has plenty to teach you. Just like learning a foreign (spoken) language often makes you better at your native one, learning other programming languages forces you to see things from other perspectives and widens your view of the forces and cosnstraints of your technique.

Still not a good enough answer? This is my best advice:

* Ask the people you work with what they use. Learn that one.
* Use the language that has the better libraries for your task.
* Figure out which groups you'd rather hang out with online. Use what they use.
* Use that for awhile (more than a couple months!) until you hate it enough to switch the something else.

I've had the pleasure of working with some insanely talented Perl programmers. However, they never really called themselves that because these people often dabbled in many languages. They weren't afraid to say "Python has a really good library for this" and then use that.

## The Niche

https://www.tecmint.com/python-vs-perl-debate-what-should-i-learn-python-or-perl/

Interpreted (python can save byte code?)

Batteries included versus CPAN

Perl has system integration built in (python import it)

## Well-Supported, Available, and Useful

Both languages are thriving. I use that word intentionally rather than "most popular". There's some value in popularity, such as the ease you having in finding candidates for a job. It's fair to say that Python is now more popular than Perl, but I've also heard plenty of grumblings about

At some point, there's diminishing returns from increased popularity. There's some minimum participation you need XXX blah blah blah XXX

## Postmodern or Zen?

Perl's informal motto is that "There is more than one way to do it", or TMTOWTDI. Or, TimToady. Larry Wall patterned his language on a natural language approach. XXX expand here XXX. Larry said that Perl was the [first postmodern computer language](http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html).

Many people forget the corollary to Perl's TMTOWTDI: "But most of them are wrong". But, it postmodernism, who can say what is wrong?

Python has the opposite (informal) module that some people saw on PythonLabs t-shirts in 2000: "There's Only One Way To Do It". This is expressed in the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) from Tim Peters.


There are some other differences. The Zen of Python says that "Beautiful is better than ugly", and it's not accident that Perl's motto is a camel. Larry asked O'Reilly and Associates for the gangly, grumpy, spitting camel because it represented what he liked about Perl. It may be messy, but it can walk across the desert.

As with any practive, neither of these make sense until they have some context.

Python is engineering.

Perl is both engineering + artistic (in a sense, your code can be more freestyle than Python).

https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-use-Python-over-Perl/answer/Christian-Walde

XXX Python has a global interpreter lock, Perl threads can execute in parallel

XXX Python 3 really has few user-visible differences from Python 2. Most of the controversy has to do with the challenge of finding people to port important libraries from Python 2 that either no longer have an active enough community to undertake the effort, or have a community that sees no value in moving to Python 3.

## The Strawman of Syntax

A colleague asserted the other day that particular tool "sucked" because it had poor and inconsistent syntax. I use that tool often (and it was about something other than Perl or Python). I don't love it but it's powerful and it gets the job done. Many people have tried to recreate the tool and they have almost always come up with something worse. Okay, I can't hide it. We were talking about `make`.

Yes, it has some gnarly syntax. I don't get too hung up on syntax. I'm willing to put up with some ugliness if the effect is powerful enough.

I tend to think of code in terms of paragraphs and don't think too much about the sentences. This group of statements  XXX where am I going here? XXX

I also don't care so much about the amount of typing I do, but I think that's largely because I was forced to learn touch typing on a manual typewriter in school (I was alive and aware of my surroundings when I saw _Star Wars_ in a drive-in theater. You know, the first one, Episode 4, much closer to the Unix epoch than we are today.).

XXX Rosetta Stone (and how it's stupid) XXX

## Sigils or No Sigils

Still, there are some syntax issues that drive people nuts. Perl likes to mark all variables with funny characters (link to David's article)
