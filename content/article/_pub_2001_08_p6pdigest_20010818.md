### [The Modules Plan]{#The_Modules_Plan}

(21 posts) The discussion
[continued](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-stdlib@perl.org/msg00163.html)
with talk about CPAN, namespaces, and implementations.

### [Perl 6 Internals]{#Perl_6_Internals}

(1 post) Simon Cozens [gave an
update](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03449.html)
on what he's up to with Perl 6.

> The other front is, of course, code. I have started writing some code
> which sets up vtables, marshals access to an object's method through
> its vtable, and helps you write new object types. I'm also trying to
> develop an integer object type. All it does at the moment is the
> infrastructure that allows you to create a new integer PMC and get and
> set its value.

(1 post) Uri Guttman
[suggested](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03453.html)
that some perl ops should be written in Perl.

(11 posts) Numerous folks continued the
[discussion](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03441.html)
on the Coding Conventions PDD.

### [Perl 6 Language]{#Perl_6_Language}

(2 posts) Michael Schwern
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08024.html)
that implicit `@_` passing be removed. Damian replied that [it would
be](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08025.html),
although as a side-effect to some new behavior.

(1 post) Garrett Goebel
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08026.html)
whether subroutine signatures will apply to methods in Perl 6.

(1 post) John Siracusa
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08027.html)
if properties were `temp`able.

(1 post) I [brought
up](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08028.html)
an inconsistency in the visibility of Perl 5's `my`, `our`, and `local`,
implicitly asking if it could be changed for Perl 6.

(3 posts) Raptor
[requested](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08029.html)
a way to preserve leading white space in Here Docs. Michael Schwern
[pointed
out](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08031.html)
that this is capable with the new functionality.

### [Last Words]{#Last_Words}

Quiet week aside, Perl 6 is alive and well. Dan Sugalski and Simon
Cozens are finishing some last minute work that could be the seed for
the Perl 6 internals. Larry and Damian are working on the next
Apocalypse and Exegesis, respectively. They should be released in about
a week.
