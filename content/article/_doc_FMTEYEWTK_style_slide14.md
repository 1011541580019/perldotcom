-   Regular Expressions are your friend. More than that, they're a whole new way of thinking.
-   Just as chess players see patterns in the board positions their pieces control, Perl adepts look at data in terms of patterns.
-   Although most modern programming languages offer primitive pattern matching tools, usually through an extra library, Perl's patterns are directly integrated into the language core. `/.../`, `$1`, etc.
-   Perl's patterns boast features not found in other languages' pattern matching, features that encourage a whole different way of looking at data.
