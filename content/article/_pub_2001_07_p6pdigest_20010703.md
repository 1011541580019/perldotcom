The lists have been very light recently. During the last two weeks of
June, three of the mailing lists received a mere 142 messages across 20
different threads. 40 different authors contributed. Only 5 threads
generated much traffic. Eventually, I'll come up with a better way of
reporting these meaningless metrics.

### [Perl Doesn't Suck]{#Perl_Doesnt_Suck}

Adam Turoff
[provided](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-meta@perl.org/msg00939.html)
a detailed summary of some recent battles against [The Big
Bean](http://java.sun.com/):

> Now, at the end of the day, I have no fewer than five JVMs installed,
> all completely different implementations of two Java standards. As a
> Perl programmer, I find this abhorrent. Installing any version of Perl
> release in the last 7 years is no different from installing any other
> release: download, extract, ./configure -des, make, make test, make
> install. Done.

Elaine Ashton, however,
[disagreed](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-meta@perl.org/msg00943.html),
to a point:

> I don't believe I was saying that. My point was that you had a bad
> experience installing Java on FreeBSD and have declared that it sucks
> to install it. Unsurprisingly, I have never had a problem installing
> or supporting Java on Solaris but there are plenty of things to
> grumble about Perl sometimes, especially if you deploy multiple
> versions and configurations across multiple platforms and multiple
> versions of those platforms.

Michael Schwern [pointed
out](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-meta@perl.org/msg00945.html)
that Solaris is "Sun's Blessed Platform", and it shouldn't be surprising
that Java should install easily there. The discussion then touched a bit
on distributions, licensing, support roles, and, yes, even George
Carlin.

### [Once Inherited, Twice Shy]{#Once_Inherited_Twice_Shy}

#### [Multiple Classifications]{#Multiple_Classifications}

David Whipp
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07621.html)
if `bless` could take, and `ref` return, a list, allowing for a cleaner
multiple-inheritance model for objects in Perl. Dan Sugalski
[simplified](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07624.html)
the request to object-based vice class-based inheritance, and then
[provided](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07631.html)
some potential trade-offs.

Damian, of course,
[submitted](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07625.html)
code to fake it in Perl 5. He did muse about an `ISA` property, though,
which would act like `@ISA`, but at the object level.

#### [Class::Object]{#ClassObject}

Michael "Class::Object" Schwern
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07663.html)
why all this (Class::Object) had to be (Class::Object) in the core
(Class::Object). Dan Sugalski
[opined](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07665.html):
> Doing it properly in a module is significantly more of a pain than
> doing it in the core. Faking it with a module means a fair amount of
> (reasonably slow) perl code, doing it in the core requires a few extra
> lines of C code in the method dispatch opcode function.

To which, of course, Michael Class::Objected:

> I've already done it, it was easy. Adding in an object-based
> inheritance system should be just as easy, I just need an interface.
> \$obj-&gt;parents(@other\_objs) is a little clunky.
>
> ...Look at Class::Object! Its really, really thin. Benchmark it, its
> no slower than regular objects.
> http://www.pobox.com/\~schwern/src/Class-Object-0.01.tar.gz

### [The Internal String API]{#The_Internal_String_API}

Dan Sugalski
[initiated](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03221.html)
discussion on the internal API for strings:

> Since we're going to try and take a shot at being encoding-neutral in
> the core, we're going to need some form of string API so the core can
> actually manipulate string data. I'm thinking we'll need to be able to
> at least do this with string:
>
> -   Convert from and to UTF-32
> -   lengths in bytes, characters, and possibly glyphs
> -   character size (with the variable length ones reporting in
>     negative numbers)
> -   get and set the locale (This might not be the spot for this)
> -   normalize (a noop for non-Unicode data)
> -   Get the encoding name
> -   Do a substr operation by character and glyph

David Nicol
[suggested](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03233.html)
implementing strings as a tree, vice a contiguous memory block. After
some pondering, this seemed to [grow
on](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03236.html)
Dan, and he is awaiting a yea-or-nay from Larry. Copy-On-Write for
Strings will also be
[implemented](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03242.html),
although there was no mention of a potential key signature.

### [Miscellany]{#Miscellany}

Simon Cozens
[released](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07602.html)
an updated version of his Perl 6 emulator.

Marcel Grunauer
[announced](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg07667.html)
a Proof-of-Concepts page for Perl 6, which contains info and links to
Perl 5 modules that may provide a glimpse of things to come.

There were more
[complaints](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03247.html)
about operator choices. (Specifically, `~` for string concatenation, and
`.` (the dot) for dereference (vice `->`).)

### [Last Words]{#Last_Words}

There's but three weeks till [TPC 5.0 kicks off in San
Diego](http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl).
