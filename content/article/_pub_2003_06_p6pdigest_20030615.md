Welcome to the last Perl 6 Summary of my first year of summarizing. If I
were a better writer (or if I weren't listening with half an ear to
Damian telling YAPC about Perl 6 in case anything's changed), then this
summary might well be a summary of the last year in Perl 6. But I'm not,
so it won't. Instead, I'm going to try and keep it short (summaries
generally take me about eight hours on an average day, and I really
don't want to lose eight hours of YAPC, thank you very much).

It's getting predictable I know, but we'll start with the internals list
-- again.

[Class Instantiation and Creation]{#class_instantiation_and_creation}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dan continued slouching toward full OO and outlined the issues involved
with setting up classes and asked for opinions. People offered them.

[Writing Language Debuggers]{#writing_language_debuggers}
---------------------------------------------------------

Clinton Pierce wanted to know how to go about writing language level
debuggers in Parrot. (This man is unstoppable, I tell you.) He offered
some example code to show what he was trying to do. Benjamin Goldberg
had a style suggestion for the code, but nobody had much to say about
Clint's particular issue.

[Converting Parrot to Continuation-Passing Style]{#converting_parrot_to_continuation_passing_style}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Much of this week's effort was involved in getting support for the
continuation-passing style function calling into Parrot. Jonathan
Sillito posted a patch. This led to a certain amount of confusion about
what needs to be stashed in the continuation and a certain amount of
bemusement about the implications of caller saves rather than callee
saves (in a nutshell, a calling context only has to save those registers
that *it* cares about; it doesn't have to worry about saving any other
registers, because its callers will already have saved them if they
cared.)

Dan ended up rewriting the calling conventions PDD to take into account
some of the confusion.

I think the upshot of this is that the Parrot core now has everything we
need to support the documented continuation-passing calling conventions.
But I could be wrong.

[Segfaulting IMCC for Fun and Profit]{#segfaulting_imcc_for_fun_and_profit}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clint Pierce's BASIC implementation efforts continue to be one of the
most-effective bug hunting (in code and/or docs) efforts the Parrot team
has. This time, Clint managed to segfault IMCC by trying to declare
nested `.subs` using the wrong sorts of names. Leo TÃ¶tsch explained how
to fix the problem. It seems that fixing IMCC to stop it from
segfaulting on this issue is hard, since the segfault happens at
runtime.

[Passing the Time]{#passing_the_time}
-------------------------------------

Clint's BASIC can now place chess! Not very well, but we're in 'dogs
dancing' territory here. Bravo Clint! There was applause.

[Meanwhile in Damian's YAPC Address ...]{#meanwhile_in_damian's_yapc_address...}
================================================================================

[New DISPATCH method]{#new_dispatch_method}
-------------------------------------------

Last week, Ziggy worried about multimethod dispatch not being good
enough. This week at YAPC, Damian announced DISPATCH, a scary magic
subroutine that allows you to define your own dispatch rules.
Essentially, it gets called before the built-in dispatch rules do;
beyond that, I know nothing.

Sorry, no link for this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Meanwhile in perl6-language]{#meanwhile_in_perl6language}
==========================================================

[Ziggy's Obsolete Thread]{#ziggy's_obsoleted_thread}
----------------------------------------------------

Last week, I mentioned that Adam Turoff had worried a little about
multimethod dispatch, and wanted to know whether it would be possible to
easily override the dispatch system. This week, he outlines the types of
things he might want to do.

See above for the resolution. Details don't exist just yet, but we'll
get there.

[Type Conversion Matrix, Pragmas (Take 4)]{#type_conversion_matrix,_pragmas_(take_4)}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Michael Lazzaro posted the latest version of his Type Conversion Matrix
and asked for comments and, hopefully, definitive answers. There was a
small about of discussion ...

[Returning from a Nested Call]{#returning_from_a_nested_call}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Whilst idly 'longing for the cleansing joy \[of\] Perl,' Dave Storrs
wondered how/whether he could write a method that would return from its
caller. Answer: yes, use `leave`.

[printf like formatting in interpolated strings]{#printf_like_formatting_in_interpolated_strings}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edward Steiner wondered about having some way to printf, like formatting
of numbers in interpolated strings. Luke Palmer (who just told me he's
embarrassed about something I wrote about something he said last week,
but I'd forgotten it) came up with a cool-looking suggestion in
response.

[Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies]{#acknowledgements,_announcements_and_apologies}
===============================================================================================

Well, that wraps up my first year of summary writing. Thanks to everyone
for reading, it's been fun.

I have one announcement to make: As of next week, there will be no
obligatory reference to Leon Brocard -- I'm getting bored of it, you all
must have been bored with it for months ... .

If you've appreciated this summary, then please consider one or more of
the following options:

-   Send money to the Perl Foundation at
    <http://donate.perl-foundation.org/> and help support the ongoing
    development of Perl.

-   Get involved in the Perl 6 process. The mailing lists are open to
    all. <http://dev.perl.org/perl6/> and <http://www.parrotcode.org/>
    are good starting points with links to the appropriate mailing
    lists.

-   /usr/bin/pod2html: p6s.pod: cannot resolve
    L&lt;p6summarizer@bofh.org.uk&gt; in paragraph 50. Send feedback,
    flames, money, photographic and writing commissions, or a nice long
    US power cable to plug into my Mac power-brick to **.
