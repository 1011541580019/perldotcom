Please send corrections and additions to perl-thisweek-YYYYMM@simon-cozens.org where YYYYMM is the current year and month. Changes and additions to the perl5-porters biographies are particularly welcome.

A somewhat abridged summary this week, since I'm out and on the road. Today Boston, tomorrow Montreal - Wednesday, the world!

### <span id="572_is_out">5.7.2 is out!</span>

Jarkko released [Perl 5.7.2](http://www.cpan.org/src/perl-5.7.2.tar.gz) on Friday the 13th, tempting fate a little.

5.7.2 has an odd-numbered subversion and so it's a development release, use it at your peril.

Jarkko says:

>         Perl 5.7.2 can be considered to be the virtual Release Candidate
>         Zero for the Perl 5.8.0, it is just not called a Release Candidate.
>         It is in pretty good shape, it is just that it is not *quite* yet
>         ready to be a major release.  No large changes are expected between
>         now and 5.8.0.

### <span id="Many_threading_fixes">Many threading fixes</span>

Artur Bergman put in a lot of work to move PMOPs into the pad; `PL_regex_padav` will now give you a padlist of regexes. He also made Perl use re-entrant C library calls where available - workarounds for `localtime` and `gmtime` are used when Perl is configured with `-Dusereentrant`. There's also a per-interpreter memory buffer which helps out with the re-entrant stuff. (No, I'm not sure how.)

Artur notes that Win32 and Digital Unix are already re-entrant due to sane C libraries, but other C runtimes may need `-Dusereentrant`.

Abhijit also wrote `re_dup`, a cloning function for regular expressions, and there have been discussions of deep cloning functions as well.

### <span id="package">package;</span>

The "super-strict" `package;` construction - used for turning off the default package - has been judged to be confusing, buggy as hell and a pain in the neck. As such, it's being ripped out - Abhijit Menon-Sen is seeing to this.

### <span id="SUPER_debate_rages_on">SUPER:: debate rages on</span>

Oh well, I tried to quickly brush off the discussion of `SUPER::` last week, but it didn't work: 60 or so messages were wasted, uh, spent on this interminable argument, which essentially boils down to " `SUPER::` is resolved at compiled time, not run time. This is wrong. Oh, no it isn't. Oh yes it is." Great.

### <span id="Various">Various</span>

Russ Allbery released a new version of the [podlators](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=podlators) and [Term::ANSIColor](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Term::ANSIColor).

Sadayuki Tomohiro produced a bunch of very useful `Encode` fixes, which unfortunately just missed 5.7.2.

Jeff Pinyan spent ages perfecting a patch to warn on `q//o`, and then realised this was a bad idea. Roughly the same thing happened for his idea of `Scalar::Utils::curse`, which was more complex than it might first appear. Oh, and Larry didn't like it the last time someone tried this. Schwern used the `curse` patch to take the opportunity to encourage people to use `Test::More` when writing new test suites. Jonathan Stowe added an option to `h2xs` to produce `Test::More`-aware test suites automatically.

Until next week I remain, your humble and obedient servant,
