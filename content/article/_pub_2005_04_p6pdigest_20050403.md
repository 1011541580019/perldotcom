### Perl 6 Language

#### [`ceil` and `floor`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9872651345221180/dfb6e19d48233e5e#dfb6e19d48233e5e)

Ingo Blechschmidt wondered if `ceil` and `floor` would be in the core.
Warnock applies, although Unicode operators would let me define
circumfix `\lfloor` `\rfloor` (although I only know how to make those
symbols in TeX.). Hmmm...using TeX to write Perl 6 code is an
interesting idea. At least then I could figure out how to make all the
special symbols. Maybe someone should make a package for that.

#### [`s///` object?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6c59b6296687b28b/ee4f77b9920d10f7#ee4f77b9920d10f7)

Stevan Little wanted to know if `s///` could return some sort of magic
object to poke or prod. Larry said "no".

#### [Markup-Like Features](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a9ed04e00bade7c0/a98a66b19415638c#a98a66b19415638c)

Michele Dondi asked if Perl 6 would have markup-like features in it.
Luke Palmer asked for a more full explanation of what he meant. Warnock
applies.

#### [The Many Moods of `does`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2095c65253615777/846c34493a77f952#846c34493a77f952)

Thomas Sandlaß wondered if anyone would actually write S14 or if `does`
ate up `tie`/`bless`, enumerating the many powers of `does`. Larry
explained that `does` will probably have mutated `bless` and then
explained the contexts under which `does` performs each of its powers.

#### [Even More Moods of `does`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/376a1703e186fdc7/cd926e769f641b48#cd926e769f641b48)

To follow up on his question about `does`, Thomas Sandlaß wondered about
`is`, specifically whether it stubbed or initialized its variable. Larry
explained that `is` would probably initialize its variable and explained
how to use `is Ref` to stub but not initialize something.

#### [Perl 5 -&gt; Perl 6 Converter](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/55f891b192f20c14/83bbcb56abdc82bb#83bbcb56abdc82bb)

Adam Kennedy dropped a line to the list about PPI 0.903, which could
form a good base for a Perl 5 to Perl 6 converter. Larry explained that
he is actually using PPD (the actual Perl parser) to construct such a
tool. He also explained how he was going to do it. Actually, it's a
really cool approach for those of you who like elegant design
approaches. You should check it out. I'll give you a hint: it starts by
writing a glorified version of `cat`.

#### [p5 Library Compatibility?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f92eba73771f2ea4/2bbcccff8279f3e8#2bbcccff8279f3e8)

Andrew Savige wondered if p6 would maintain the interface for most p5
libraries. chromatic almost died of fright from the suggestion. Juerd
suggested a deprecated namespace for such things. Larry gave him a Ponie
instead. Later, Larry thought that perhaps a special namespace for those
libraries that could be automatically converted might be appropriate.

[Follow-up](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/317bd71bbbdcb75b/f25e44a2a6acaac7#f25e44a2a6acaac7)

#### [Importing Constants and Header Files](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/e689486905f15375/a66721f161fa1b8f#a66721f161fa1b8f)

Song10 wondered if there was an easy way to import constants from a
module and not have to specify their full scope in the includers file.
Larry explained that p6 will have "policy" modules which would allow
this. He then began to let his mind explore the possibility of allowing
these modules to return a string to evaluate in the user's scope. Then
he realized how nasty textual inclusion was in C and C++, and figured
that a hygienic policy would be better.

#### Giving Lists More Operators

Juerd constructed a table of string, integer, and list operators. He
noticed that the list section had blank spots where string and integer
both had items. He then suggested quite a few more operators to fill
these blanks. This morphed into a discussion of code complexity and
reading code.

-   [Operators](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5421becb49cd4d45/93d8d0a1784b26de#93d8d0a1784b26de)
-   [Complexity](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f17650313a30cbd2/13e063f81b8fc046#13e063f81b8fc046)

#### [String Pain](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a95fa7c746d4701a/cb333037a316bf59#cb333037a316bf59)

Chip wondered what exactly set `str` apart from `Str` and the impact
this difference had on Unicode support. Larry and Rod Adams explained
that `str` specifies a raw bytes view of strings and requires explicit
casts between different Unicode levels.

#### [`xx` on Coderefs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f092a633812dd0f2/968acd5602237302#968acd5602237302)

Luke Palmer wondered if the `xx` operator could include overloading to
run a coderef repeatedly and slap the results together. Others liked it,
but there was no word from on high.

#### [Running Pugs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c934ac4a3d8062fb/b2e6bc96f946f634#b2e6bc96f946f634)

Adam Preble had some strange problems with Pugs' `make install` target.
Warnock applies.

#### [Manipulating Many Dimensional Hashes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/acceda3b5d2f187e/2ec6fd2eccb43de7#2ec6fd2eccb43de7)

Zhuang Li wanted to know how to manipulate hashes of unknown dimension.
Luke Palmer provided the answer.

#### [Semantics of Currying](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/24aa21dd6f97b3b0/7ad67c4f07be22f8#7ad67c4f07be22f8)

Yuval Kogman has been implementing currying in Pugs. As such, he has
found some of the under-specified corner cases. Thus he, Larry, Luke
Palmer, and Thomas Sandlaß delved into these mysteries.

#### [Multi-paradigmatic Perl 6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4cfcd0a1d4f53443/b41f615fc1e53d96#b41f615fc1e53d96)

Someone named Eddie posted a fairly long message to p6l on the Google
Groups interface suggesting that Perl 6 support delegation and other
programming paradigms. Sadly, no one told him that it already does both
of those things, because nobody saw his email. Google Groups does not
send messages back to the list.

#### [NB for Pugs on Low Memory Machines](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0af412a7054b8d13/4479115dcdc51e44#4479115dcdc51e44)

Adam Preble posted a helpful warning about installing Pugs on machines
with less than 200 MB of memory. Unfortunately he also posted it to
Google Groups. People should stop doing that. Is there some way to tell
Google to prevent them from doing that?

#### [PLEAC](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b29d689814d0a50e/bd6ed3ba5ee17ffb#bd6ed3ba5ee17ffb)

Tim Bunce suggested that people could add programming examples to PLEAC
for Perl 6. Of course they should run in Pugs if they are being released
to the world at large.

#### [Annotating Code with Documentation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ee84f795b861a961/7df6e2459c0bead8#7df6e2459c0bead8)

Chip wants to be able to document his code by attaching documentation
directly to it. This would allow for nifty introspective features. Larry
pointed out that code will have access to the surrounding POD.

#### Typo in S03

Aaron Sherman pointed out a typo in S03. Luke Palmer explained that
dev.perl.org did not mirror the svn tree just yet. Juerd found one too
and received the same answer. This time, though, Robert Spier put in the
necessary magic so that dev.perl.org would update from svn.perl.org.

-   [Aaron](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/68a7e0178a8a95f7/09503722ee7bc48d#09503722ee7bc48d)
-   [Juerd](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/65be84ce6c31bbbf/f5c9381e2193c02c#f5c9381e2193c02c)

#### [Optimization Hints](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a89f6bf2170ebc88/27fab5f0a8dc612c#27fab5f0a8dc612c)

Yuval Kogman noted that Perl 6 has some ability to provide lexically
scoped hints and suggested a few more things that might be hintable.
Larry opened the door for him to try to design such features.

#### [S29 Update](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/17969d56c1fb86e0/849d4e45300554bd#849d4e45300554bd)

Rod Adams' efforts to update S29 continue to push a very large thread
about things including numification of strings and various core
operators.

#### [String Positions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/afad6d022c082774/1c880e5b9a5d101b#1c880e5b9a5d101b)

Aaron Sherman wanted a more OO way to look at the OS. Larry did not
really agree but suggested that someone could create a proxy object
which would reference all of those globals. Then a conversation about
having units attached to numbers sprang up. That sounds like a good
module to me.

#### [`modify` and `assign` Operators](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/1813d3d7b46c1bc5/bf70c18431f210b4#bf70c18431f210b4)

Andrew Savige wondered if there was a complete list of operators
anywhere, because he could not find `~^=` (string xor) documented
anywhere. Larry explained that the assign should probably be a meta
operator to allow for better extensibility

#### [p5 -&gt; p6 Guide](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6bf1b2d4d5ffaf32/b107fe5aac5709d2#b107fe5aac5709d2)

Adam Preble wondered if there was a basic p5 -&gt; p6 guide.
Unfortunately he posted to Google Groups.

#### [`$_.method` vs `$self.method`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/cf458503a5ec514f/2ea8a9d3e3e0fc75#2ea8a9d3e3e0fc75)

The debate about whether `.method` should mean `$self.method` or
`$_.method` continued. `$self` is still winning.

#### [Typo Problems](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f6f0b8c28f4a7e00/d89b9178125802ca#d89b9178125802ca)

It seems that Juerd has typing problems. He wanted to know if he could
form a support group. Apparently he can only if he uses vim.

#### Renaming Flattening and Slurp

Terrence Brannon wants to change the terms "flatten" and "slurp" to
something else. Larry told him that this usage was unlikely to change.

-   [Flatten](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6364ee28da83e810/fe2a9bb6f846a662#fe2a9bb6f846a662)
-   [Slurp](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/699cf7f622b1e571/a9bb20ee75538f60#a9bb20ee75538f60)

#### [How Read-Only is Read-Only?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4a8eb25e57148fcb/03ba459e92fde91a#03ba459e92fde91a)

Chip wondered how deep read-only-ness or `is copy`-itude went on
arguments. The answer appears to be: shallow. This led to a very long
discussion of how much type checking will actually occur.

#### [`pick` on Non-Junctions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/24e369fba3ed626e/6e6a2aad1dcc879d#6e6a2aad1dcc879d)

Ingo Blechschmidt wondered what `pick` would do on an array or a hash.
Many folk explained that it would remove and return an item or pair from
the container respectively. Larry commented that `pick` on a hash could
be harder than it looks.

#### [Built-in Multi Methods](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/50079a618601b80d/e7c815b3765d8103#e7c815b3765d8103)

Wolverian wondered if some of the common functions called on strings
would actually be methods. Larry answered that they would more likely be
multis to allow for easier extension.

#### [Comparing Two References](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a264690496f82a28/383b82ce7c84105e#383b82ce7c84105e)

Darren Duncan wanted to know if `=:=` was the correct operator for
testing if two variables refer to the same object. Larry explained that
it was. This led to a debate about how easily people can deal with
chains of references in Perl 6.

### Perl 6 Compiler

#### [Pugs Test Failures](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/7ec5b9680b2e2b25/44dd1e2c65a9ec0e#44dd1e2c65a9ec0e)

Will Coleda worriedly reported 115 failing subtests in Pugs. Stevan
Little explained that this was normal for between releases and was
really more of a TODO list than a problem.

#### [Pugs Darcs Repo](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/403ad974f7e3295d/be5a3ad79573ae3f#be5a3ad79573ae3f)

Greg Buchholz noticed that the darcs repo for Pugs has trouble staying
up to date. Tupshin Harper suggested using
`darcs whatsnew --look-for-adds --summary` to find the offending files.

#### [`BEGIN {}` Time](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/7d0fcc2e85d25883/7c202ea0f1302c96#7c202ea0f1302c96)

Autrijus wondered when `BEGIN` should run. Markus Laire posted a useful
summary of when the various CAPITAL things should run. Larry confirmed
Autrijus' suspicion.

#### [YAML Test Output](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/244ea8a4b952c9c2/71eff01bb226d6e1#71eff01bb226d6e1)

Nathan Gray wondered if he should change his tests log to YAML output.
Stevan Little pointed him to
[Test::Harness::Straps](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Harness::Straps),
which can collect test output and transform it.

#### [Semicolons in p6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/c08bbb8c8ba05f23/e425757e0f39458d#e425757e0f39458d)

Andrew Savige found some strange behavior with respect to statement
separation in Pugs. He thought that perhaps semicolons had changed their
status. They haven't.

#### [Ugly Dog Meets Ugly Bird](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/2996dd373c00a9f0/bdf1c3471a53045b#bdf1c3471a53045b)

Pugs r2\^10 can compile p6 to imc which Parrot can run. I think I speak
for everyone when I say "Wow. Nice work, Autrijus.".

#### [String Interpolation and Various Special Variables](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/4cff94d05a0f66e8/5865ad1edbec35a3#5865ad1edbec35a3)

Andrew Savige noticed a couple of odd corner cases for string
interpolation in Pugs. This led to a discussion of which special
variables (like `$!`, `$/`, and `$"`) will continue to exist.

#### [Code Coverage Metadata](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/92946e6c221cea6e/bee7738ae13d3611#bee7738ae13d3611)

Paul Johnson posted a list of requirements he would like to see
satisfied so that he can easily generate Perl 6 coverage reports.
Warnock applies.

#### Pugs Release

As is the fashion, Pugs went through two minor releases during this two
week period: 6.0.13 and 6.0.14.

-   [6.0.13](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/d977531c8c3c26a6/fef6c555d7f2d77f#fef6c555d7f2d77f)
-   [6.0.14](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/503f0f59d17d6de6/fc3c3dfa03be639b#fc3c3dfa03be639b)

#### [Text Editor Support for Perl 6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/06170de60f15c7d1/b8af8ddd9f6668e6#b8af8ddd9f6668e6)

Darren Duncan suggested that it might be a good idea for people to begin
prepping their favorite text editors to handle Perl 6 syntax correctly.
Why stop at syntax? I know I want to be able to type `:perl6do` in vim.

#### [`Makefile.PL`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/b908159d1d42be9d/4f7c49cf1c4913eb#4f7c49cf1c4913eb)

Darren Duncan noticed that most things in Pugs use Perl 6, while
`Makefile.PL` was still Perl 5. He suggested writing the `Makefile.PL`s
in various modules in Perl 6 also. He then began work on a
`Pugs::Makemaker` module.

[Work
Begins](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/a54799a8447544d7/75deb16e3f23bba6#75deb16e3f23bba6)

#### [Pugs to Become a Perl 6 -&gt; Parrot AST Compiler](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/a3de948450686dfb/f8bd616ed25e8ba9#f8bd616ed25e8ba9)

Autrijus explained that he was planning on steering Pugs toward becoming
a Perl 6 -&gt; Parrot compiler which would interpret code (when Parrot
is not available) by mapping imc to Haskell.

#### [Pugs Re-org](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/7c8a2fde84a44680/cc7ccf80f1db6b9f#cc7ccf80f1db6b9f)

Stevan Little suggested rearranging the Pugs repository a bit. The end
result is that modules which don't run in Pugs (yet) should go in
`modules/` while those which do should go in `ext/`.

#### [YAPC::NA Pugs hack-a-thon](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/b7654876184c315a/e5c177b644291946#e5c177b644291946)

John Macdonald posted his plan for the` YAPC::NA` Pugs hack-a-thon. His
description of the location makes me want to take time off work to go.

#### [`split` Semantics](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/bbfafdaf0f206314/bcb73c32ffd9f8f4#bcb73c32ffd9f8f4)

Stevan Little found a bug in Pugs' `split`. Autrijus fixed it, but noted
that he had not replicated the full, bizarre semantics of Perl 5 (which
come from awk). Larry told him not to work too hard on it, as it would
probably work in Perl 6 through a separate function.

#### [Statement Modifiers](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/e655790aec06ff1c/b6bc7f344224557d#b6bc7f344224557d)

A bug in Pugs' parsing led Autrijus to seek information from a higher
authority. Larry explained the power of statement modifiers.

### Parrot

#### [Move Perl Tests Out of `pmc/pmc.t`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5d07eef5fd6cc4e8/ae7deac783274d56#ae7deac783274d56)

Steven Schubiger volunteered to reorganize `pmc/*.t` last time. He did
it, and Leo applied the patches.

#### [Areas of Focus](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/bf62dabc84b701c6/14246cc09d5e5efd#14246cc09d5e5efd)

Chip, in a circumloquacious attempt to come up to speed, indirectly
asked what design issues needed attention. Leo explained the CPS issues
that bogged down Parrot of late.

#### [Improving MinGW Docs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c64adac9b6b4b822/0b570c16d600dffd#0b570c16d600dffd)

François Perrad provided a patch improving the documentation for
building with MinGW. Leo applied part of it.

#### [Moving `pmc2c2.pl` or `pmc2c.pl`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0cbe09585e5a3aed/75773e6add39f91b#75773e6add39f91b)

Matt Diephouse opened an RT ticket for cleaning up the file system
(specifically `pmc2c2?.pl`).

#### [The Learned Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a5c89c1afb285fda/6de665799f024868#6de665799f024868)

Christian Aperghis-Tramoni reported that he has had success using Parrot
assembly as a teaching tool.

#### [Performance and Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/17d6d6f97b715e1c/ca0ffab9e2314369#ca0ffab9e2314369)

Falcon posted a series of questions about Parrot in a fairly general
sense. Unfortunately, because he posted it to Google Groups, Warnock
applies.

#### [First MMD call](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/98dbeeeefc63093c/e4d842b427760caf#e4d842b427760caf)

Leo posted a first MMD call which uses an MMD PMC and a fair amount of
hand-made calling conventions set up.

#### [OpenBSD `atan2` Trouble](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f0304137d88751b6/7fb8c5d8b405e5ff#7fb8c5d8b405e5ff)

Steve Peters noticed that `atan2` on OpenBSD is not quite right.

#### [API Change](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d3e1c7eadf5f7192/71a24123fabd55b8#71a24123fabd55b8)

Leo changed various packfile functions to take an `Interp*` argument.
This does change the embedding API, but it had to be done.

#### `pmc2c2.pl` Cleanup

Leo pointed out that `pmc2c2.pl` was not functioning correctly on all
platforms. He put out a call for interested parties. Matt Diephouse
provided a patch to clean up the internals of `pmc2c2.pl` a bit. Leo
applied it. Peter Sinnott returned a `$` that got lost in the shuffle,
and chromatic applied it. Matt went on to add better comments.

#### [`README.win32` Update](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/56fd45369cc73260/952fba174cef9d9a#952fba174cef9d9a)

Klaas-Jan Stol provided an update to the `README.win32` directions.
Warnock applies.

#### [`SET_NON_ZERO_NULL`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9c9bf38c5ca50048/11363375f1e55224#11363375f1e55224)

Chip wondered why Parrot had a SET\_NON\_ZERO\_NULL macro and suggested
removing it. The answer was, of course, speed. On architectures with a
zero null, this can be a no-op allowing the use of `calloc()`. Otherwise
it has to do something.

#### [PMC Constants](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ff04eefc36e9ea76/c72babeefba6f5a3#c72babeefba6f5a3)

Leo added support for `.const` things to imc. Unfortunately, the GC eats
them so you can't use it yet.

#### [Garbage Collection and Hash Creation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5b6a6e14efa7b74d/cdd2e03ca8a80a7f#cdd2e03ca8a80a7f)

Cory Spencer's LISP implementation revealed a bug in the hash creation
sequence. Leo fixed it.

#### [MD5 Update](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f1c260366651efd4/021b233898e21a3a#021b233898e21a3a)

Nick Glencross provided an update to the MD5 library. Leo applied it.

#### Tcl Updates

Will Coleda has been updating Tcl. He moved the parser into a PMC. Then
he tried to add octal and hex escapes only to discover missing
transcodings. He also found missing hash functions, but Leo fixed that.

-   [Parser](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/01fb6c6708902757/7e63bfff44b38cf3#7e63bfff44b38cf3)
-   [Transcodings](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f99a9979165e08dd/fd4c8b0780abb7b6#fd4c8b0780abb7b6)
-   [Hash](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/46298cb009469440/84a812d27e659c62#84a812d27e659c62)

#### [Logging IRC](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e21a3949e4760878/5efff144d804f62e#5efff144d804f62e)

Someone suggested that we start to log IRC. Chip suggested that this
might not be cost effective as such logs are 99% dross and 1% value. He
suggests instead that people paste the good part into emails for the
list. I know that I, for one, would not volunteer to summarize IRC.

#### [Segfault Generating `config.fpmc`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e969976fbb944239/7b3eab465b44ab5a#7b3eab465b44ab5a)

chromatic (as his Linux PPC is wont to do) found a bug in the build. He
fixed it, and Leo applied the patch.

#### [Lazy, Lazy Steve](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/89a3517b473389fd/860892e9d0f5b12f#860892e9d0f5b12f)

Leo added a first implementation of a Lazy PMC for Autrijus to play
with.

#### [Win32 `make install`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f047aae076f5df5d/0ab639455638d725#0ab639455638d725)

François Perrad provided a patch fixing `MANIFEST.generated` for Win32.
Warnock applies.

#### [Parrot on Win32](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5417ba0786150aa6/43f10dcc8c2e9c58#43f10dcc8c2e9c58)

Ron Blaschke spent some time fixing Parrot on Win32, extending it to
provide a shared library.

#### [mod\_parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/837c5d3bf114b39e/a67922987c2a4498#a67922987c2a4498)

Jeff Horwitz released mod\_parrot 0.2. It includes nifty features like
the beginning of an interpreter pool.

#### [C90 Cleanup](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9fa5bf0bf84e783a/f0e37d095ada4337#f0e37d095ada4337)

Peter Sinnott moved a few declarations further up. Leo applied the
patch.

#### MMD on Argument Count

Leo added the ability to MMD on argument count and PMC types.

-   [Count](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/77ca782dd06c0271/4c42835ce6388c3d#4c42835ce6388c3d)
-   [Types](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5326320dee6c5480/6c5f23d859e7a2f4#6c5f23d859e7a2f4)

#### [Documentation Typos](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/12f6f0ef9392c03d/8ebff13ccba5eb58#8ebff13ccba5eb58)

Offer Kaye fixed a few typos. chromatic applied the patch.

#### [`pmc freeze.t`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/eaf8660cb92100bf/006a51cbb9bdc9b3#006a51cbb9bdc9b3)

Leo admired the trickiness of Bernhard Schmalhofer in his `freeze`
implementation.

#### [`sys.t` failure on MinGW](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c0e9e185719ea7ae/f818bdab1df8b19f#f818bdab1df8b19f)

François Perrad fixed a test failure on MinGW. Leo applied it.

#### [Builtin Namespaces Issue](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6e795edbac04ef39/23e648965fbcafdf#23e648965fbcafdf)

Peter Sinnott pointed out some failing tests. Leo fixed them.

#### [`locate_runtime_file` Error](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c6eb0df40f37237c/6b4165aed54fd51a#6b4165aed54fd51a)

Bob Rogers provide a patch to switch `PARROT_TEST` to 1 by default. Leo
applied it.

#### [Bytecode Re-entrance](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/fe139bf30260fa2e/aa1df4154c4e828a#aa1df4154c4e828a)

Nigel Sandever had some questions about how Parrot and threading worked.
Melvin Smith provided the answers.

#### [Pugs Questions for Parrot FAQ](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2df9d71e603fc2af/0236d8408d5c696f#0236d8408d5c696f)

Nicholas Clark noted that the question of why bother with Parrot when
one has Pugs has come up recently. The answer went into the Parrot FAQ:
speed.

#### [Pascal for Perl](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0d03005eee522bfa/7327ab601eeae744#7327ab601eeae744)

Sven Schubert wondered if people had any suggestions for how to get
PAPAgei (his Pacal for Parrot compiler) up and running quickly. Leo told
him to stick with the tools he knows rather than going too far afield.

#### Infix Op Proposal

Leo posted his proposal for how to revamp infix ops. Nicholas Clark and
Luke Palmer asked a few questions.

-   [Discussion](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9872731839119930/18f0a04dcae50a5b#18f0a04dcae50a5b)
-   [Moae](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/472630c2b0603134/0815f5def2528387#0815f5def2528387)

#### [Lexical Pad Depth](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/27ad49203fb127e9/860547f9152f1c15#860547f9152f1c15)

Cory Spencer wondered how to find the depth of the lexical pad stack.
Leo told him.

#### [Win32 Exit Codes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/212955f9b4d3a2ad/c4c5e050ce386f1b#c4c5e050ce386f1b)

Ron Blaschke noticed that there were tests failing on Win32 because the
exit code was not in the high 8 bits, but appeared directly. Leo
suggested looking to Perl 5 for prior art on what to do.

#### [Other Languages on Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/72c0c2401220a3dd/6584831afd40324c#6584831afd40324c)

Bloves wondered if any other compilers were currently working toward
targeting Parrot. I pointed him to Cardinal, a Ruby compiler for Parrot
that appears dead.

#### [Parrot64](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/efedec7ce9c44b2a/e5769b252a9941c3#e5769b252a9941c3)

Adam Preble wondered if there has been any work on Parrot for AMD64. The
answer is: some, but nobody told him because he posted to Google Groups.

#### [Parrot Win32-Setup](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/54aba6b5de626a03/990013f2549886ff#990013f2549886ff)

François Perrad provided a patch that creates a standard binary
distribution for Win32. There was some debate over the name of the make
target, but François is ready to send an updated version at Leo's
command.

#### [Calling Convention Abstraction](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d0fe25767929714f/c1f5f17efc7b6560#c1f5f17efc7b6560)

Leopold Toetsch proposed a calling convention abstraction that would
allow Parrot to change its ABI a little more freely in the future. Roget
Hale asked a few questions which Leo answered.

#### [No 0 Size Arrays](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/63feffac3e90a07e/c2a932928fb1c823#c2a932928fb1c823)

Ron Blaschke noticed a broken Windows build, because of a 0 sized array.
Leo fixed it.

#### [Unicode String Literal Assertion Failed](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5583663eb8a02b6f/7d4a76dfd09b45ee#7d4a76dfd09b45ee)

Will Coleda discovered a failing assertion in `utf8.c`. Leo fixed it.

#### [NCI Call Signature Change](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/99d4af353893d1a1/b00816d25aff741a#b00816d25aff741a)

Leo changed the call signature for NCI to make `I` mean INTVAL and `J`
mean Parrot Interpreter.

#### [Builtin Infix Multis](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/cf0aec53e126c012/4fbb010b37b34fec#4fbb010b37b34fec)

Leo added support for MMD on infix multis.

#### [`touch` vs `utime`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2b4206275a5bf5b6/7c1e998cc73ecac4#7c1e998cc73ecac4)

Chip asked if there was a reason that the `TOUCH` variable doesn't use
`utime`. Michael G. Schwern suggested
[ExtUtils::Command](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ExtUtils::Command).
Steve Peters points out that `utime` works only on existing files.

#### [`make imcc.l` For Modern Flex](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8dc8adf441fa6805/173d69e1fc260fda#173d69e1fc260fda)

Chip opened a TODO for updating `imcc.l` to modern flex.

#### Mac OS X Build Broken

Will Coleda reported a broken build on Mac OS X with undefined symbols.
Leo found the cause and reverted it.

-   [Problem](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5e58af5059fa2946/356b9e568eca3039#356b9e568eca3039)
-   [Solution](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/4d012f6c68ffb933/1b1ec3ecc2e16fb0#1b1ec3ecc2e16fb0)

#### [SVN Switch](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8eece4a7517b63cd/91249b1c59096f12#91249b1c59096f12)

After much debate, the decision to switch from CVS to SVN has happened.
The move will include the removal of ICU as a dependency. [Good
progress](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/506f637ec0cb36cc/adc0690ef419b75d#adc0690ef419b75d)
has occurred on that front.

#### [MD5 on 64 Bits](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7197ff1e2d33d6ec/b0533304331f2186#b0533304331f2186)

Nick Glencross has been hard at work trying to fix the MD5 library for
64-bit systems. It would be easier if he had access to one.

#### [Python Version Guesswork](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/caabd5aa219eebc8/d711871c5d49df91#d711871c5d49df91)

Ron Blaschke noticed that ActiveState Python reports its build as 2.4
instead of 2.4.0. He provided a patch to account for this.
