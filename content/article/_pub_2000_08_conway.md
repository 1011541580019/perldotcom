*Dr. Damian Conway is best known in the United States for authoring*
Object Oriented Perl*, published by Manning. His lectures at Perl
conferences are becoming legendary and are a joy for Perl hackers of all
levels. I managed to catch up with Dr. Conway just before his fall
semester of lecturing at Monash University in Australia began.*

**Joe Johnston: Although you give a pretty decent account of your
teaching career at <http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~damian/bio.html>,
could you state your day job for the record?**

**Damian Conway**:

Name: Conway, D. M.\
Rank: Senior Lecturer, Computer Science, Monash University.\
Serial number: 8371 466.
**JJ: Fred Brook's Mythical Man Month and No Silver Bullet are classic
essays on the business and art of software engineering. The main point
of the former is that application developers need to be managed more
like commissioned artists, rather than as factory workers. The later
work suggests that there will never be a design tool that significantly
makes software development schedules more deterministic. Are these works
still relevant and do you have your undergrads read either of these?**

**DC:** I often recommend "MMM" to my software engineering students, but
mainly for the real life horror stories it includes. They do a semester
of SE and think they're ready to build their own operating system.
Brooks' tales from the trenches are a useful antidote.

Both books *are* still relevant, even though we're now living in The
Future. The situations and problems they describe may be now mainly
historical, but the underlying issues are perennial.

Programming is a Dark Art, and it will always be. The programmer is
fighting against the two most destructive forces in the universe:
entropy and human stupidity. They're not things you can always overcome
with a "methodology" or on a schedule.

And when you look at it, we haven't come that far in the quarter century
since Brooks first published "MMM." Sure we have more development tools
and techniques, but most of them (and most programming languages too!)
don't really help. Especially not on large projects (i.e., anything over
three or four developers).

They're designed to force the software team into someone else's (usually
academic) conception of how a program should be created. Generally they
advocate ways of working that make *no* allowance for the needs,
motivations, and goals of the humans in the system. So Real Programmers
don't use them, and programming stays a handicraft -- a multi-trillion
dollar cottage industry.

Of course, it would be easy to fix that: make the software vendors
liable for the correctness and reliability of their software and you'd
see an instant revolution in development. There's plenty of research and
practical experience in building reliable systems using unreliable
components (i.e., programmers). But as long a companies can turn a buck
or two (billion) by shipping pre-beta quality software, why would they
bother to find or mandate better ways?

**JJ: There are those in the Open Source Community that point out that
greed is not sufficient motivation to produce quality software, which is
often the labor of love. How can Joe Programmer (not this Joe
programmer) learn to love developing accounting applications?**

**DC:** He or she *can't*. No more than you can make a COBOL programmer
love hacking kernel. People sometimes offer me contracts writing DB
interfaces or building websites, but I tell them I'm not worth what I'd
charge to do that. Because I'd be doing it strictly for the (very large
amount of) money, rather than for love of the project. They wouldn't get
my best.

Whatever software your trying to build, you need people who are inspired
by the *idea* of that software. Even if they aren't virtuoso hackers:
you can always teach a person to code better, or tidy their code after
it's written; you can *never* teach a person to love your project. And
without that emotional engagement, you'll never get the superhuman
effort that's required to produce quality software.

It often seems to me that recruiters ask the wrong questions when
interviewing programmers. Sure you have to find out if they know the
difference between an argument and a parameter, but it's vastly more
important to discover what kind of enthusiasm and energy they're going
to bring to your project, why they'll put in 18-hour days on it, why
they'd pay *you* to work on it. Find those people and you'll get quality
accounting software.

And in a roundabout way, that's why we need diversity in languages (and
*within* languages). So that there can be languages that fit a diversity
of brains. So that every kind of geek can find his or her passion. Many
of us love to diss COBOL and VB and Ada and PHP and Python, but we need
to remember that, without those languages and the brave souls dedicated
to -- and inspired by -- them, *we* would have to write accounting
software and bad GUIs and defence protocols and dull websites. In Perl.
`:-(`

**JJ: The world needs uncool software. Can we judge the hepness of an
application by its quality?**

**DC:** No. Because to some folks it *really is* hip to be square. All
you can tell about quality software is that someone thought it was
important enough to care about, to invest themselves in. And people can
feel that way about the oddest, unheppest things: model trains, mime,
cloisonne eggs, folk dancing, even accounting applications.

**JJ: At Perl Conference 4.0, the Best Technical Paper award was renamed
the Damian Conway Award. I don't even have a name on my office door.
Will you be posing for the award statue?**

**DC:** I'm only 5'6''. Put me on a block of marble and I could *be* the
award statue!

**JJ: That won't work. You wouldn't stand still long enough to present
the award.**

**DC:** That could be the criterion: to win the award you have to keep
up with it `:-)`

**JJ: If a calendar of Perl Hunks were assembled, which month would you
be?**

**DC**: JJ: You *have* to get off the drugs, Joe! And soon! A Perl Hunk
calendar??? How sick is that?

Oh, very well then: August.

**JJ: This just in from the Perl section of Teen Beat, what tunes are on
your CD/LP/MP3 player these days?**

**DC:**

-   "Five", J.J.Cale
-   "Oxygene", Jean-Michel Jarre
-   "'Gladiator' soundtrack", Zimmer & Gerrard
-   "'Sense & Sensibility' soundtrack", Carl Davis

**JJ: Speaking of fluff, Paul Allen has been *real* busy spending money
these days. From seeding Transmeta to donating millions to the Search
for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI), Allen has been spreading his
Microsoft millions liberally. What projects would you like to fund with
your future trillions?**

**DC:** C'mon! I'm a mad scientist/hacker from Australia. I *seriously*
doubt I will ever have major disposable income.

But if I did, I'd be funding:

1.  Nanotechnology. I *want* microbots tending each blade of grass on my
    lawn and quitely rolling dust and dirt off my floors.
2.  Vacuum point energy research. I hate having to recharge lap-top
    batteries. Energy wants to be Free.
3.  Gerontology. We only get one go, and 100 years isn't nearly long
    enough.
4.  Education. Better education reduces world misery in so many ways. It
    fights poverty, overpopulation, prejudice, and tyranny.
5.  People. I'd spend my time finding humanity's best and most creative
    people, and just pay them to be them. Sure, you might not pick the
    right person 9 times out of 10. But what if the tenth were another
    Mary Shelley, or Frank Lloyd Wright, or Murasaki Shikibu, or Larry
    Wall?
6.  A Buddhist monastery. Peace is a renewable resource, but the world
    lacks enough processing capacity.

    **JJ: For the people that have read your book "Object Oriented Perl"
    or heard your conference lectures, your commitment to bring
    respectability to Perl's OO model is well known. Oddly enough, you
    have seem to have other comp sci interests. What is "automation of
    hypermedia" and how does it apply to user interfaces?**

    **DC:** Anyone who has put together a large website knows how long
    and hard the process is. Anyone who has tried to use a large website
    knows how rarely the process is done well.

    For a time, I was developing tools to make it possible to generate
    navigable, comprehensible, usable websites with nothing more
    that vi. I developed a system that used text files for content, with
    very minimal mark-up, to generate full websites for various
    programming courses I was running. It would index all the material,
    cross-reference it, annotate it with exercises, hyperlink it back to
    glossaries and bibliographies, construct course syllabuses and
    outlines, etc., etc.

    And, of course, it was all done with a single, rambling, arcane,
    semi-sentient Perl program `:-)`

    **JJ: Have you used HTML::Template or HTML::Mason? Both allow Perl
    to be embedded in an otherwise static HTML page. This is sort of the
    server-side include method as used by ASP and Cold Fusion.**

    **DC**: I haven't used them, but I've heard very good things about
    both modules.

    **JJ: More generally, is Perl ready for next generation web
    applications or are Perl tools not evolving fast enough for very
    large websites with large and diverse development teams?**

    **DC:** I'm not sure anyone or any tool is ready for the demands of
    mega-websites, anymore than existing software development approaches
    are ready for Programming In The Very Large. I don't think we know
    how to reliably create huge linear programs that are safe, robust,
    and efficient. Add in the web's demands for multimedia,
    hyperconnectivity, and interactivity, and I think our software
    technologies are at least a decade behind demand.

    **Some parent groups in the U.S. question whether computers are
    having a positive impact on children. They claim that video games
    are not meaningfully more interactive than Plain Old TV (POTV).
    Should any nation eschew raising teachers' salaries in favor of
    installing classroom computers? Are the Luddites right?**

    **DC:** Technology is not the enemy. *Deification* of technology is
    the enemy.

    Any nation that favours a technological fix over funding good
    teaching is going to get what it deserves: neither a technological
    fix, nor good teaching.

    Western culture is increasing about magic bullets. We think a pill
    or a weekend course or a laying-on-of-hands is going to instantly
    solve our problem. As though we lived in a weekly sitcom with a
    30-minute story arc.

    Putting computers in classrooms instead of teachers is doing just
    that: Latching on to a single "quick fix".

    Of course, you do have to give the kids access to the technology.
    Not doing so nowadays is as criminal as not teaching them to read.
    But you still have to teach them to read, and think, and learn, as
    well!

    Put 30 kids in a room with an easel, a computer, and a guitar.
    You'll get one Van Gogh, one Von Neumann, and one Van Halen (or Van
    Morrison). And 27 burger flippers. `:-(`

    Every child has some great potential, but almost all of them need
    help to find it, and nurture it, and control it, and master it. They
    need a teacher, a guide, a role model. No machine is going to give
    them that. At least, not for a long time yet.

    **JJ: The big news at TPC 4.0 of course was Perl Episode 6, The
    Phantom Rewrite. What are three (or more) things you'd most like to
    see addressed in this reconstruction?**

    **DC:** Well, I have a list of 40 or so things I'm hoping to propose
    for Perl 6. The big ones include:

    -   Getting rid of the requirement for a final true value in
        `require`'d files
    -   Finding a better name for `local`
    -   Making == work more DWIMly on numeric operands strings
    -   New control structures: co-routines, switch statement, multiway
        comparisons
    -   Fixing the nested iteration behaviour of hashes
    -   Redesigning the format syntax and make it a subroutine in a
        pragma
    -   Subroutine parameter lists and extra context specifiers
    -   Numerous enhancements to OO Perl:
        -   hierarchical construction and destruction
        -   built-in encapsulation of attributes
        -   extended, integrated operator overloading
        -   multimethods
        -   method redispatch
        -   method pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants (also
            for ordinary subroutines)
    -   Regular expression matching against subroutines and filehandles
    -   Run-time access to source code parse tree, and simpler source
        filters
    -   Higher order functions
    -   Lazy evaluation of subroutine argument lists
    -   Extended context detection features
    -   Superpositions

    **JJ: What are the three scariest nightmares the corporate world has
    about Perl that prevent wider adoption of our favorite language?**

    **DC**: I don't know very much about the corporate world, but I
    guess three common fears might be:

    -   

        Perl is unclassifiable
        :   COBOL is a banking language, Fortran is a numerical
            computation language, C is a systems programming language,
            Visual Basic is a GUI applications language, Java is a web
            programming language. What is Perl?

    -   

        Perl is unmaintainable
        :   Line noise programs, numerous defaults, subtle context
            propagation, symbolic references, closures, unconstrained OO
            model, one-liners, weird modules maintained by weirder
            hackers, typeglobs, AUTOLOADING, operator overloading,
            source filters, etc., etc.

    -   

        Perl is unsupported
        :   Yeah, I know, I know. But there's no \$599 MS-Perl with a
            GUI interface and an exorbitant support contract.

    The Perl Mongers are making valiant in-roads against those
    perceptions, but they can't make Perl the static, commercial, boring
    tool that many managers are used to. And hence comfortable with.

    We'll have to wait until the grunts who are actually using Perl in
    the trenches -- and holding entire organizations together with it --
    get promoted into management. For them, Perl *will* be the safe and
    familiar option.

    **JJ: You're a big burly OO dude. Why aren't you programming in
    Python?**

    **DC:** When you live in Australia, you learn to be wary of snakes.

    Seriously though, I don't use Python because I'm not *just* a big
    burly OO dude. I'm also a frightening functional dude, and a devious
    declarative dude, and an insidious imperative dude. In order to mess
    with people's minds, I need to be able to mess with a programming
    language's syntax and semantics: add a switch statement, change the
    dispatch model, superimpose scalars, lock down hash access,
    intercept error messages and convert them to haiku, impose
    design-by-contract constraints, or reconstruct the language in Latin
    or Klingon. Only Perl lets me push (fold, spindle, multilate) the
    envelope like that.

    **JJ: What's your favorite part of your native country?**

    **DC:** The hilly spa country around Daylesford, Victoria. Rolling
    green hills, temperate climate, clean air, perfect.

    **JJ: The US "Dot.COMomy" has become colder than a bartender after
    closing time. Will those programmers who have only been in start-ups
    have a hard time adjusting to an economy in which they aren't lusted
    after like jade idols?**

    **DC:** Good programmers will always be in demand -- there are so
    few of them around. And computers and the Internet are here to stay,
    even after the hype has died.

    Those refugees from Start-Ups are not going to see the same mania
    for their services, but they'll still see good salaries and
    packages. What they'll have trouble adjusting to is an economy where
    they're expected to perform within the rules, keep office hours,
    wear shoes, write reports, cut code to spec rather than because it's
    cool. That's going to hurt. But the companies that survive will
    survive because they extract more value from their employees than
    those employees cost. In that sense, there is no "new" economy.

    The down side is that, in the future, you'll have to be right on the
    end of the bell curve to offer your boss enough value to justify the
    cost of your bohemian behaviour.

    **JJ: If Perl were to disappear tomorrow, what would its legacy
    be?**

    **DC** That programing languages should be made to fit humans, not
    vice versa.
