In case you missed it: the Built in Perl 2018 [developer survey](http://blog.builtinperl.com/post/perl-developer-survey-2018) is open until May 7th. [Last year](http://blog.builtinperl.com/post/perl-developer-survey-2017-results---part-1) there were 849 responses from Perl developers, with interesting results:

* 84% of respondees have been programming in Perl for over 5 years
* 21% were working remotely
* 46% were interested in or had already tried Perl 6
* 25% use the [Mojolicious]({{< mcpan "Mojolicious" >}}) web framework with [Dancer]({{< mcpan "Dancer" >}}) and [Catalyst]({{<mcpan "Catalyst" >}}) both around 19%
* Vim was the most popular text editor at 43%, followed by Emacs at 16%

I wonder what the stats will show this year, for fun here are a few predictions from me:

* The % of Perl developers working remotely will increase
* Atom will overtake Sublime as the 3rd most popular text editor
* The top web frameworks popularity won't change
