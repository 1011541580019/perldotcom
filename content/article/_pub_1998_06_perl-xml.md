### How to Make Perl The Language of Choice for XML

\
Perl has been the language of choice for anyone doing serious text
processing. Now efforts are underway to make Perl the language of choice
for those doing "structured" text processing using the Extensible Markup
Language (XML).

The [XML 1.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/tr/1998/rec-xml-19980210)
was recently (Feb. 10, 1998) released as a recommendation by the [World
Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/). XML is a subset of SGML
(Standard Generalized Markup Language) and it seems to be emerging as a
universal syntax for defining non-proprietary document markup and data
formats. XML made significant changes to SGML to reflect the nature of
the Web and to make it easier to build tools that process XML.

Tim Bray, co-editor of the XML 1.0 specification, has used Perl
extensively for huge text processing applications. He had a special
interest in seeing a bridge built from Perl to XML -- one that would
make it simple for programmers to process XML data. So, out of this
interest, a small group of developers met at O'Reilly & Associates in
Sebastopol, California for a one-day Perl/XML summit. In addition to
Tim, those attending the summit were:

-   Larry Wall, creator of Perl, and senior developer, O'Reilly &
    Associates
-   Dick Hardt, developer of Perl for Win 32, and Chief Technology
    Officer, ActiveState Tool Corp.
-   Tim O'Reilly, President and CEO, O'Reilly & Associates
-   Dale Dougherty, CEO, Songline Studios
-   Gina Blaber, Director, Software Products Group, O'Reilly &
    Associates.

"In the design of XML, we were continuously mindful of the need to
enable the fast, efficient creation of scripts and programs for
processing XML," says Tim Bray.

"For many of us in the XML effort, the most important goal is to
increase the proportion of the world's documents stored in open,
non-proprietary formats," Bray continues. "Building slick XML processing
into Perl makes the use of such formats more rewarding and helps
frustrate the efforts of those who would imprison human knowledge behind
the barbed-wire of proprietary file formats."

"XML is currently perceived as powerful and important, but not
particularly easy," explains Larry Wall. "This makes XML and Perl
naturally complementary, since Perl is a language that makes easy things
easy to do, and hard things possible."

One of the first steps that the summit group identified was to get Perl
working with Unicode (ISO 10646). Unicode enables code to be easily
translated into other languages; XML requires Unicode. Larry Wall will
lead the team working on this task.

The next step is figuring out at what level Perl actually provides
support for XML: whether it's built into the language, implemented as a
module or a combination of both.

Among the goals set at the meeting were:

-   Release a Perl/XML spec in Q3, 1998.
-   Establish a mailing list for discussion of Perl and XML developer
    issues.
-   Develop an XML white paper, co-authored by Larry Wall and Tim Bray,
    to be released this spring.

If you are interested in these efforts, you might want to attend the
Perl and XML session at the XML Developer's Day in Seattle at the [The
XML Conference](http://www.gca.org/) on March 27, 1998. Larry Wall and
Dick Hardt will be speaking. The Perl Developer Update will also keep
track of new announcements.
