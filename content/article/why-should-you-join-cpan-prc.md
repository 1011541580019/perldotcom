The CPAN Pull Request Challenge (PRC) aims to improve the quality of code on [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/), the online archive of Perl modules, by having participants submit pull requests to CPAN module authors.

Every month participants are assigned a new module to improve, and submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to the module repo on GitHub. Participants are not competing with each other, rather The "challenge" is to keep up with your monthly assignments.

### How to signup

You can join as an individual or as a team. A team could be your company, you and a few friends, or your local Perl Mongers group.

Simply email Neil Bowers ("neil at bowers dot com") your GitHub username and PAUSE ID if you have one, or if joining as a group, your GitHub organization name. Tell him you want to join the challenge, and you are in!

### How it works

Once per month, you will receive an email noting your assigned distribution:

You can fix a failing test, fix an issue, correct a typo, any kind of improvement. If you're not sure where to start, there are services on top of CPAN that can help identify issues:

* [CPAN Testers](http://cpantesters.org/) is a Continuous Integration service that often identifies issues with failing tests and/or platform specific bugs
* [Request Tracker](https://rt.cpan.org/) is the default bug tracker for CPAN modules (issues may also be listed on GitHub)
* [CPAN Cover](http://cpancover.com) reports on code coverage for tests
* [CPANTS](https://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) is a "kwalitee" assessment tool

A good place to start is to find your assigned module on [metacpan](https://metacpan.org), a CPAN search engine which links to all of the above services. Scan through the module documentation and related information, to try and find things that need fixing or enhancing.

Once you've identified the changes you'd like to make, fork the module on GitHub, commit your changes and open a pull request with the new changes. Then reply to your assignment email saying "It's done!", and link to your pull requests on GitHub:

Although it's better to do your assignments every month, you may not be willing to commit to it, and that is fine! If something comes up, you can skip a month. If you need more time for a module, you can stick to your assignment for longer. There's a solution as long as you want to keep participating.

### Why join

Let me give an interesting reason first. [2018 may be the last year of CPAN-PRC](http://neilb.org/2018/01/01/cpan-prc-2018.html). [It may evolve into issue-based assignments](http://neilb.org/2018/01/06/what-after-prc.html) too. But this will most likely be the **last year** you can get a CPAN module assignment.

I joined this challenge [in 2015](https://kyzn.org/2015-01-17-cpan-pr-challenge-012015.html), when I was still at college. It was a great motivation for me to go read other people's code, even though  I had hard time understanding it. It was also a great chance to get used to open source ecosystem. I did 4 assignments in 2015, another 4 in 2016, and doubled to 8 in 2017. I am also part of [Team-ZipRecruiter](https://github.com/ziprecruiter), which is getting group assignments since April 2017. It really is fun!

If you are looking for more reasons, here's a few.

- If you are a student, and want to learn more about "production-ready" code, this is the perfect opportunity! Remember, you also get to meet people who wrote that code. 
- Or you are a senior programmer, but you haven't contributed to open-source much. This is a great way to begin!
- You do like contributing, but you don't want to spend too much time. This also makes sense! PRC doesn't take too much time, and you can always skip (like I did).
- You spend a lot of time polishing your own modules, but you want to explore other modules: What else is out there? 
- You used to write Perl, but that was years ago. You are looking for a reason to come back.
- You are looking for a programming-related team-building event!
- You are looking for event ideas for some other language community. How awesome is that!

Sounds interesting? Then send an email to neil at bowers dot com with your GitHub username!
