### [Closures]{#Closures}

(17 posts) Dave Mitchell
[started](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08032.html)
the debate on whether closures should be explicitly declared, by way of
having lexical variables not import into nested blocks implicitly. Some
areas of discussion centered around whether [named subs are
closures](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08043.html),
[closures are ever created
accidentally](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08034.html),
and [the current behavior is
correct](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08038.html).

Dave further provided some insight into [how closures actually
work](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08039.html),
to help explain his point:

> With the \$x:
>
> foo() is a closure created at compile time. By the time the main {}
> block has been executed (but before foo() is called), the \$outer:x is
> undef, and \$foo:x is 'bar' (standard closure stuff). When foo() is
> executed, the anon sub is cloned, and at that time, \$anon:x is set
> from from foo's pad, so it gets 'bar'.
>
> Without the \$x:
>
> foo is no longer a closure - ie it doesnt have a private copy of \$x
> in its pad. At cloning time, sub {\$x} picks up its value of \$x from
> \$outer:x, since there isn't a \$x in foo's pad - thus it picks up
> 'undef' from \$outer:x that went out of scope a while ago.

### [Method Signatures]{#Method_Signatures}

(12 posts) Damian Conway
[answered](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08052.html)
last week's question on whether subroutine signatures will apply to
methods in Perl 6. There was some subsequent debate on how strict Perl's
optional typing would need to be, and how easily it would still be to
circumvent through regular Perl magic.

### [`Foo::$bar`]{#Foobar}

(2 posts) Brent Dax
[asked](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08060.html):

> I was thinking about Perl 6 today, and thought of something: if the
> sigil is now part of a variable's name, does that mean that \$Foo::bar
> should actually be Foo::\$bar in Perl 6?

Michael Schwern's
[thinking](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08063.html)was:

> Techincally 'bar' is shorthand for the complete name, 'Foo::bar'. So
> '\$Foo::bar' would remain.
>
> Besides, Foo::\$bar looks funny.

### [Perl 6 Internals (Yes, There Are Some...)]{#Perl_6_Internals_Yes_There_Are_Some}

(5 posts) Dan Sugalski
[announced](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03459.html)
that he's got code:

> I've got the rudiments of the parrot interpreter and assembler built
> and running. (I get around 23M ops/sec on a 700MHz Alpha EV6) I'm
> beating it up enough to get it into a reasonably released state, so
> while I'm doing that...

Simon Cozens made [this
suggestion](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03461.html):

> On an unrelated note, and seeing Dan \[and\] Bryan's experiments with
> different kinds of switch/dispatch, I think it makes sense to separate
> out ops which correspond to PMC vtable functions (add, subtract, etc.)
> and those which don't. Those which do can be done with a switch to
> save a function call, and those which don't can use function pointers.
> This achieves the same objective as auto-generating op wrappers around
> vtable functions, (saving one level of indirection) while leveraging
> the gain from a split-level op despatch loop.

### [More Modules]{#More_Modules}

(7 posts) John Siracusa
[continued](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-stdlib@perl.org/msg00187.html)
the discussion on the Perl 6 module plan, calling for more conformity in
APIs, and deepening the namespace heirarchy.

Kirrily Robert
[pointed](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-stdlib@perl.org/msg00191.html)
to some work she's been doing on the
[perl5-porters](http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/)
list -
[perlmodstyle](http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg62256.html)
- in preparation for Perl 6.

### [Last Words]{#Last_Words}

We should be seeing Apocalypse 3 (Larry Wall) and Exegesis 3 (Damian
Conway) sometime this week, if things are on schedule. Nathan Torkington
is currently
[evaluating](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg03467.html)[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/)
as the Perl 6 code repository.

> I'd like to keep the code on Sourceforge from the get-go. I don't have
> much experience with Sourceforge, though, and would like to talk to
> someone who has. Which bits work well? Which bits aren't worth the
> effort? Any tips or tricks to pass on?

If you've got some opinions, pass them on to
