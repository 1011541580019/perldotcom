It was a light week due to the holidays. There were 52 messages across 26 threads, with 14 authors contributing. About half were directly related to patch submission.

### <span id="JIT">JIT</span>

The bulk of the non-patch postings this week centered around the JIT. Nothing earth-shattering, although problems with gcc 2.96 under Red Hat Linux have [shut things down](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07165.html) for that configuration.

### <span id="Output">Output</span>

Dan Sugalski [provided](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07164.html) primitives for output.

### <span id="Parroty_Bits">Parroty Bits</span>

The [Perl Development Grant Fund](http://donate.perl-foundation.org) crested 25%.
