All~

Sadly, a slip of the mouse caused me to delete a partially completed summary, so I am going to push ahead on the rewrite without a witty intro. Feel free to make one up for yourself involving stuffed animals, musicians, and dinner.

### Perl 6 Compilers

#### [Pugs 6.2.0](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/96465d8b9ad451d9/506edf0f1f75fd18#506edf0f1f75fd18)

Autrijus released Pugs 6.2.0, marking the first major milestone for Pugs. This includes most of the control flow primitives of Perl 6 and is a testament to the solid work that all of the "lambdacamels" have put in.

#### *CGI.pm* and Multibyte Characters

BÁRTHÁZI András had trouble encoding and decoding multibyte characters in *CGI.pm*. This led to a general discussion of how to avoid such characters in URLs as well as when to call `chr`.

-   [Discussion](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/750a78b4aba5ab30/18de224db1c6456a#18de224db1c6456a)
-   [More Discussion](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/2583cd2ad56bcb8a/b146ba42087af46e#b146ba42087af46e)

#### [Auto Currying?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/c188af3a040a766c/2bed10c78e871766#2bed10c78e871766)

Matthew D. Swank wondered if he really needed an extra set of parens to call a function generator and its generated function simultaneously. Autrijus told him that yes he did as Perl 6 is not quite Haskell yet.

#### [Case Insensitive P5 Regex](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/e02fee049f84a748/0a265818f9c46346#0a265818f9c46346)

BÁRTHÁZI András wanted to use the `:i` switch on P5 regexes. Autrijus implemented it, but Larry noticed that this introduced a flag ordering dependency. As a result, the new way to supply flags to a Perl 5 regex is `rx:P5<imsxg>/.../`.

#### [Cookbook Ettiquette](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/46d6404cce43e170/0e86f5489b6951e8#0e86f5489b6951e8)

Marcus Adair wondered if there were rules of etiquette he should obey when writing examples for the Perl 6 Cookbook. In particular, should examples run and be only one file? Ovid suggested that one file was a good idea, but was open to contrary arguments.

#### [Austrian Parrot/Pugs Hackathon](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/cdccc751c9d251a2/12384146569d9acd#12384146569d9acd)

Thomas Klausner announced that on June 9-10 in Vienna, Austria there would be a Hackathon featuring the collective might of Autrijus, Chip, Leo, and more. When that much brain power gets together only two things can happen: much hacking and much drinking.

#### [Encoding Illegal Byte Sequences in Strings](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/fb83a5437e07b928/ba9781abcd3406ca#ba9781abcd3406ca)

BÁRTHÁZI András wanted to know if he could encode an illegal byte sequence in a string. Much discussion ensued, but Larry promised that it would be possible.

#### `Test::TAP`

Yuval Kogman announced the release of two new modules to CPAN that provide Pugs smoke HTML.

-   [Announcement](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/2bb8a11c2456fdce/f27a8093b5667c5e#f27a8093b5667c5e)
-   &lt;a href="http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/pugs\_test\_status/"Smoke 'em if You Got 'em

#### Quoting Constructs

Roie Marianer noticed that Pugs was missing some quoting constructs. He implemented them. This led to discussion of interpolation and corner cases. As usual, Larry provided both answers and questions. Roie produced a patch which Autrijus applied.

-   [Discussion](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/bb1969aa24008431/f7eb1b0d77d6e3cd#f7eb1b0d77d6e3cd)
-   [Useful Pugs Hacking Pointer](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/209d5a637ab00993/e7eb743f074c8f8d#e7eb743f074c8f8d)
-   [The Patch](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/f61f0ef868e0d9e0/653a73b1f938d4e9#653a73b1f938d4e9)

#### [Code Block as Argument](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/82071725b70ea804/992d32212401500b#992d32212401500b)

Stevan Little found some bugs with passing a code block to a function in Pugs. Warnock applies.

#### `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` on Infinite Lists

Stevan Little has been playing with `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` on infinite lists. He thinks he has found a bug, although maybe he just hasn't let it run long enough. Larry provided answers regarding the correct semantics.

-   [`shift unshift`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/727e096e9985ffc6/2f200d6cf002ecda#2f200d6cf002ecda)
-   [`push pop`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/bfa0db91e317104f/41f8dcf309c64d9c#41f8dcf309c64d9c)

#### [`cd` Issue in *Makefile*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/d4717e1fcdd5a631/bbd547275ba2f292#bbd547275ba2f292)

Jonathan Worthington noticed a Win32 issue in the *Makefile*. He can point to the offending line in the autogenerated *Makefile*, but that is not where the fix belongs. Warnock applies.

#### [Hyperoperator Tests](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/ffc05ce65d1302fa/cab2f4338c64478d#cab2f4338c64478d)

David Christensen provided a patch for hyperoperators. Unfortunately, character set transcodings ate his patch.

#### [`shift` Oddity](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/2a8de017213467c9/7ac0b26446af4265#7ac0b26446af4265)

Stevan Little noticed that `shift` did not act like `pop`. Larry noted that the examples were not semantically valid, but even so, Pugs should not freeze.

#### [Pugs SEGV](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/03cfcd08924cf777/758242dfd55d908d#758242dfd55d908d)

Aaron Sherman managed to make Pugs segfault. Autrijus thinks someone might already have fixed it.

### Parrot

#### [Dynamic Perl 2](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e458e5ae236f2475/a14a81f3562cabb4#a14a81f3562cabb4)

Jens Rieks reported a difficult-to-reproduce bug. This caused Leo to pine for having the SVN revision in the bug report. Brent "Dax" Royal-Gordon commented that this was a good idea. Jens Rieks offered to implement it.

#### [Win32 SDL](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ec13c071e394b978/75c590055366af40#75c590055366af40)

Jerry Gay tried to get SDL working on Windows. There was some give and take, but in the end, it works.

#### [`-l/path/to/icu`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e3b32552ce77272d/8ebf83f7e535740e#8ebf83f7e535740e)

BÁRTHÁZI András wondered about the general security mechanisms that Parrot would provide. Dan assured him that security would be a fundamental part of Parrot. He also provided [a sketch of the Parrot security model](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/becd70c749ed8802/b2cc77c111663f98#b2cc77c111663f98) which sparked some discussion.

#### [Debian ARM Failure](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b06bf58efba82f2e/fb7f013cb9f7acab#fb7f013cb9f7acab)

Steven Philip Schubiger provided a patch fixing some small spelling errors. He worried that perhaps he picked nits needlessly. I don't think so, but Warnock applies.

#### [Win32 ICU Error](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a88e134e75e0fb96/7cc20604fbe7b7e6#7cc20604fbe7b7e6)

Yuval Kogman threw out the idea of using subscripts as objects. Larry worried that this would hurt speed a little too much.

#### [Statement Modifiers and Scopes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/50537b038eb01049/504dc73599f6b0e9#504dc73599f6b0e9)

Paul Seamons posted some examples involving local scopes and statement modifiers. Larry decided that only curlies will delimit scopes, so as not to surprise too many people.

#### [Whitespace in heredocs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f5dd10f62f347193/4f9e9e44613ece7b#4f9e9e44613ece7b)

Michael G. Schwern wanted a simple tied variable interface to `$*CWD`. This is apparently a sensitive topic. Much discussion ensued of changing directory in bizarre circumstances. It looks like Michael's suggestion will not reach the core, although it looks like a fairly simple module.

#### [Junction Precedence Error](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9cbe727d2d3c7127/a5b95a51b4f1faba#a5b95a51b4f1faba)

#### [Spelling Mistake in A06](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/10f723c000997305/2f8569964e8d201d#2f8569964e8d201d)

Steven Philip Schubiger found a spelling error in A06. Patrick R. Michaud applied the patch.

#### [`<[a-z]>` to Become `<[a..z]>`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/eb469e49d67ee887/5d5ce1a957b4a656#5d5ce1a957b4a656)

Larry decided that the range operator in character classes should change to `..`. Much discussion ensued. I like it.

#### [Tainted Variables](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9627c979812b1881/18e4deaee9092db2#18e4deaee9092db2)

BÁRTHÁZI András wondered if he could mark variables as tainted. Luke Palmer showed him a way.

#### [Re-declarable `temp` Variables](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a3ee0ad28cfc7358/b954df420903258e#b954df420903258e)

Aaron Sherman wants a way to re-declare variables without warnings. He suggested `temp`. Larry suggested `ok` to turn off a warning, but doesn't think Aaron's feature is really necessary. There's no official ruling yet, I think.

#### [Hyper Slices](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/7e5c8e60a262b033/a7e2220ac0c3cc26#a7e2220ac0c3cc26)

David Christensen wants to use hyper slices as a convenient way of dealing with multidimensional data structures. Luke Palmer showed him how.

#### [Hyperoperator Corner Case](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d19673092609908c/952a1c33601dce87#952a1c33601dce87)

David Christensen wondered how hyperoperators know what to pad with when one side is not long enough. The answer appears to be slightly ill-defined magic, especially when considering subtraction or division.

#### [Fine Granularity Sleeping/Events](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5ef4b7c6b01cd63a/a627dd913e587f72#a627dd913e587f72)

Gaal Yahas wants to have an `alarm` function that takes a double (for systems with sub-second timing promises). He also wants a version that takes a callback (possibly called `later`). Warnock applied.

#### [Junctions in Subscripts](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2dbde23ef0bb8940/cd9c7a6b2e672cb8#cd9c7a6b2e672cb8)

David Christensen wants junctions in subscripts to autothread. Luke Palmer commented that they might. I think they do.

#### [Quote Operators and Interpolation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2d5818a0af6f6232/e190635e9d89b772#e190635e9d89b772)

Roie Marianer had a few questions about how interpolation and quote operators would work. Larry and Juerd provided some answers. Larry's short version: "We pretend we're a top-down parser even if we aren't".

#### [Junctions with Adverbs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/fa98d6ef70da6f85/8f099d9225ffb5a1#8f099d9225ffb5a1)

David Christensen wants to use adverbs to supply exceptions to junctions. Luke Palmer told him that it doesn't work that way.

#### [`++` Evaluation Order](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f44055d378fa3515/0466f9879137871e#0466f9879137871e)

Lam Fayland found an oddity in Pugs evaluation order for `++`. Warnock applies.

#### [Statement Modifiers for Setting Variables](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/121ac8d96c776bb9/6e51a2caa5699e94#6e51a2caa5699e94)

Dave Whipp wants to use statement modifiers to restrict the scope for variables in his `print` statements. Larry provided a different technique.

#### [Tie Hashes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4bf493833cdb0e0b/57da4ba88cf2aa4a#57da4ba88cf2aa4a)

Ingo Blechschmidt wondered what syntax to use for tying hashes. Larry began to muse aloud.
