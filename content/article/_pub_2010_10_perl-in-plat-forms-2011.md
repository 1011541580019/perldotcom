Thanks to [Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ](http://search.cpan.org/~daxim/) for sending
along this notice about the [Plat\_Forms 2011 web development
contest](http://www.plat-forms.org/). Unlike other comparisons of
programming languages (such as [the great unmaintainable speed-tweakers
micromeasurement contest](http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/) and This
Is Odiously Bad Empiricism), Plat\_Forms features real teams of real
programmers performing real work.

Perl 5 can compete very well in this contest, with great web frameworks
such as (but not limited to) Catalyst, Dancer, Mojolicious, and Jifty.
See the [Plat\_Forms 2011
overview](http://www.plat-forms.org/platforms-announcement#overview) and
[Plat\_Forms 2011 on the Perl 5
Wiki](https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/index.cgi?events_2011_plat_forms)
for more details.
