or *easier than tying your shoelaces*

Most of you know [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl), the commercial Perl distribution provided to the community for free by [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/). In the beginning, ActivePerl did not bundle a C compiler. As Windows does not include a compiler, much of the CPAN was inaccessible to Windows usersâ€”any dependency on an XS module would fail. ActiveState instead provided a repository of binary PPM packages so that users could avoid the need to install and configure a C compiler.

So began a rumor, and so the rumor became lore, that "ActivePerl Does Not Do CPAN."

As wrong as that preconception had been (and a clever hacker could use MSVC or MinGW with ActivePerl), that rumor became even more wrong on 26 August 2009, when ActiveState delivered Perl 5.10.1 with a bundled C compiler. Even though Windows does not support *all* POSIX features, using CPAN with ActivePerl on Windows is almost as nice as using CPAN on a Unix-like system:

-   Download and install [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads) (5.12.4 and 5.14.1 are available at the time of this writing) with the default options
-   Open a command line window ( Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd )
-   Run `cpan`

That's it. That's only one extra step over running on Linux. For proof, here's the output of my first run of the `cpan` command (edited for brevity) and an installation of [local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib) and [cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus) (yes, they work too):

    It looks like you don't have a C compiler and make utility installed.  Trying
    to install dmake and the MinGW gcc compiler using the Perl Package Manager.
