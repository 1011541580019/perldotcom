Please send corrections and additions to
perl-thisweek-YYYYMM@simon-cozens.org where YYYYMM is the current year
and month. Changes and additions to the perl5-porters biographies are
particularly welcome.

This was a reasonably normal week, seeing the usual 500 or so messages.

Many thanks again to Leon for last week's summary.

### [Module Versioning and Testing]{#Module_Versioning_and_Testing}

There's a move on to make the modules under `ext/` free-standing: that
is, to be able to say

cd ext/File/Glob

make dist

and get a bundle that can be uploaded to CPAN or otherwise distributed.
The only problem with this is tests. Currently the tests are kept under
`t/` of the main root of the Perl source tree, and are run when a
`make test` is done there. To make the modules freestanding, you'd have
to move the tests to `ext/Foo/Bar/t/` and have the main `make test` also
traverse the extension subdirectories and run the tests there. But then,
of course, there's another problem. Can you spot it?

`make test` is run from an uninstalled Perl, which needs explicit hints
about where to find the Perl library. Hence, the tests in `t/` directly
wibble `@INC`. This wouldn't work if we're making the modules
freestanding, or if we move the tests to `ext/Foo/Bar/t/`. So the trick,
which nobody's done yet, is to move the tests to the right place, change
the main `make test` to recurse extension subdirectories, but also to
propagate an environment variable telling the module where to find the
library. ( `PERL5LIB` is what you want for this.) That would be a nice
little task for someone...

Speaking of testing,
[Schwern](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#SCHWERN) got
`Test::Simple` and `Test::More` added to the core, bringing the first
All Your Base reference into the Perl source tree. Oh, and **how** many
different testing mechanisms?

[Robin Houston](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#HOUSTON)
incremented `B::Deparse`'s version number and added some change notes.
Here's what's improved since 5.6.1:

        Changes between 0.60 and 0.61 (mostly by Robin Houston) 
        - many bug-fixes 
        - support for pragmas and 'use' 
        - support for the little-used $[ variable 
        - support for __DATA__ sections 
        - UTF8 support 
        - BEGIN, CHECK, INIT and END blocks 
        - scoping of subroutine declarations fixed 
        - compile-time output from the input program can be suppressed, so that the 
          output is just the deparsed code. (a change to O.pm in fact) 
        - our() declarations 
        - *all* the known bugs are now listed in the BUGS section 
        - comprehensive test mechanism (TEST -deparse)

The new test mechanism is great: it runs the standard Perl test suite
through `B::Deparse` and then back through Perl again to ensure the
deparsed code still passes the tests. And, as a testament to the work
that's been done on `B::Deparse`, they mostly do pass.

Schwern also bumped up `ExtUtils::Manifest`, which caused Jarkko to
appeal for a script which checks two Perl source trees to find updated
versions of modules without a version change. Larry Shatzer provided
one, and Jarkko used it to update the versions in the current tree.
Schwern also put `Cwd` on CPAN, and found a weird dynamic loading bug
with the XS version of `Cwd`. Oh, and noted that after his benchmarking,
there's no significant performance loss between 5.6.1 without PerlIO and
bleadperl with it.

### [Carpentry]{#Carpentry}

[Mike Guy](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#GUY) partially
fixed a problem whereby when a magic variable like `$1` is passed as a
subroutine parameter, `carp` and the debugger don't see it properly.
Tony Bowden took the opportunity to ask for either more or less
documentation for `longmess` and `shortmess` depending on whether or not
they were meant to be internal to `Carp`. Tony wrote a documentation
patch himself.

Schwern asked for a better name for those functions, perhaps more in
line with the carp/croak/cluck theme. Jarkko suggested `yodel` and
`yelp` which Schwern implemented.

[Andreas](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#KOENIG) had a
quick bitch about Schwern's, uh, idiosyncratic naming style:

> Your style of naming things is just plain sick:
>
> AnyLoader does anything but interface to any loader. Ima::DBI has
> something to do with DBI, but nothing with Ima. D::oh is the only
> really funny one. But it's from 1999 and getting old. Sex: I still
> don't know if it is fun or what. Bone::Easy? Same here.
> Semi::Semicolon? Same here.
>
> And now yodle!

Unfair, though, since `yodel` and `yelp` weren't his...

However, Hugo objected to `yodel`/ `yelp` because the other verbs write
to standard error, hence "speaking" whereas `longmess` and `shortmess`
don't actually "say" anything. Jarkko agreed, and there the matter
rested. (Modulo Rich Lafferty's suggestion of "flame" for objections in
a written medium...)

### [Regex Capture-to-variable]{#Regex_Capture_to_variable}

Jeffrey Friedl (he of the Regexp book) came up with an interesting patch
which adds the new special variable `$^N` for the most-recently assigned
bracket match. This is different from `$+` which is the highest numbered
match; that's to say, given

        /(foo(bar))/

then `$+` is equivalent to `$2`, whereas `$^N` is equivalent to the
bracket match for the last closing bracket; that is, `$1`. This
essentially allows you to do capture-to-variable, like this:

        (?:(\d+)(?{ $phone_number = $^N }))

without having to worry about which number bracket the match was.
(Especially useful if you have to change your regexp around.) Whether
this makes regular expressions cleaner or dirtier, I'll leave up to
you... However, Jeffrey also noted that you can use regexp overloading
(my, that's an obscure feature - look at `re.pm`) to make such syntax as

        (?<$phone_number>\d+)

work. Now that's cool.

Phillip Newton added a nmenomic: `$^N` is the most recently closed
Nested parenthesis.

### [Perl on S390]{#Perl_on_S390}

Hal Morris got Perl going on Linux/390, with only one test failing. Good
news for the new generation of mainframe hackers.

There's mixed news for the old-timers, though; Peter Prymmer has got it
down to 10 test failures, but one of the tests completely hangs Perl.
Apparently `study` under OS/390 is best avoided. He also started some
investigation of a `Bigint` bug, under the direction of Tels and John
Peacock, but left for his holidays and the discussion moved to the
`perl-mvs` mailing list.

### [UTS Amdahl]{#UTS_Amdahl}

Oh, and talking of weird platforms, UTS. Hal (who's actually from UTS
Global, so much kudos there) has been testing out recent Perl builds on
UTS, and turning up some ... take a deep breath ... icky numeric
conversion issues.

[Nicholas Clark](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#CLARK)
was convinced they (well, some of them at least) were due to UTS C going
through a `foo--` statement twice, but Hal pointed out he didn't expect
UTS C to be quite that braindead. On the other hand, Nick's analysis
looked convincing...

Hal also fixed up `hints/uts.sh` so that UTS now configures and builds
nicely at least.

### [Various]{#Various}

David Wheeler found a known but really, really weird bug with lexical
arrays; if you do:

        my @a = foo(); my @b = foo();
        sub foo { $x = 0; my @ary; push @ary, "hi" if $x; push @ary, "ho"; return @ary }

`@a` gets "ho" as you'd expect, but `@b` gets "ho","ho". Ronald Kimball
told him Not To Do That, Then.

Peter Prymmer noted that Perl on VMS was bailing out during the test
suite, leading to lots of bogus failures. This only happens if none of
the DBM libraries (GDBM, DB\_File, NDBM or SDBM) were built. As the
first three require external libraries that VMS doesn't have and the
last one is currently broken, it's no wonder Perl is bailing out. The
fix is to work out why SDBM has stopped building on VMS. Peter also
produced a lot of other VMS and HPUX reports.

[Andy](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#DOUGHERTY) was
pleasantly surprised to note that the promised "binary compatibility
with 5.005" actually works even in bleadperl. Perhaps we need to break
more things.

John Peacock asked a portability question for XS bit-twiddling; he's
trying to adapt a math library which depends on casting two numbers to a
long and adding them together to avoid overflow. Jarkko's fantastic
architecture experience was brought to bear as he revealed that Cray
Unicos has `long == short == int == double`. Oh, and type casting has
issues too, so you have to use a union. Nicholas Clark suggested the old
trick of comparing the operands of an addition with the result; if the
result is smaller than either of the operands, you've overflowed, so you
add a carry and off you go.

The news that GCC 3.0 was out brought a rush of people testing Perl out
with it; I got it through on Linux with all tests successful, as did H.
Merijn Brand on HPUX, but with rather a lot more warnings. This was
because HPUX messed up the test for `__attribute__` due to using a HP
linker instead of a GNU one. Merijn and Jarkko got this fixed up.

Artur continued his iThreads quest; he renamed the "shared" attribute to
"static", (and then again to "unique" after objections) presumably to
free it up for an attribute which actually does share variables between
interpreters, and also added a function which cloned the Perl host. He
said that `threads-0.01`, the new threading module, will be released to
CPAN when 5.7.2 hits the road. (Which Jarkko keeps hinting will be very,
very, very soon now.) He also complained bitterly when Marcel Grunauer
tried to document `attributes.pm` as useful, despite the fact that
Marcel has some really very cool modules on CPAN based on it...

Marcel also found, and Radu Greab fixed, an insiduous bug in `split`,
whereby if the default whitespace pattern was used for one iteration of
a loop, it would be used for all succeeding ones; the `PMf_WHITE` flag
for the regular expression was being set but never unset. Urgh.

[Ilya](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#ZAKHAREVICH)
produced some rough changes documentation for OS/2, as well as some
other little patches. Norton Allen provided some QNX updates.

[Phillip Newton](http://simon-cozens.org/writings/whos-who.html#NEWTON)
documented the neat

        $count = () = function()

idiom for counting the number of return values from an operation. That
was something I hadn't seen before; you learn something new every day...
Until next week I remain, your humble and obedient servant,
