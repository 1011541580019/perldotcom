Perl 6 is the major redesign and rewrite of the Perl language. Parrot is
the virtual machine that Perl 6 (and other languages) will be written
for. For more information on the Perl 6 and Parrot development efforts,
visit [dev.perl.org](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/) and
[parrotcode.org](http://www.parrotcode.org/).

### [Apocalypse 4]{#Apocalypse_4}

Larry Wall released [Apocalypse 4](/pub/a/2002/01/15/apo4.html),
covering blocks (and scopes and statements). It's quite weighty,
particularly up front, but here's a quick glossy on what's covered:

-   the new `given` / `when` switch block

-   exceptions
-   scope changes
-   no more required parentheses for expressions in block constructs
-   a lot more flow-control blocks
-   multiple iterators in looping blocks

There are quite a few other tidbits inside. The Apocalypse was released
late Thursday night, so little feedback, and no Damian Conway's
Exegesis, have been processed yet. I'll pick up community reaction next
week.

### [Parrot Strings]{#Parrot_Strings}

Jarkko Hietaniemi, the Perl 5.8.0 pumpking,
[posted](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07856.html)
a developing PDD on string handling in Parrot, largely based on his
experience providing Unicode support for Perl 5. The main tenets of the
proposal are:

-   separate binary data and its API from textual data and its API - at
    both the language and internals level

-   convert all text - string constants, source code, input data - to
    the internal representation: UTF-16, or a UCS-2 (non-surrogate) and
    UTF-16 (surrogate) hybrid
-   handle localization as a separate layer

Most of the following discussion centered around regular expression
character classes, and how to best implement them. Brent Dax is
currently using UTF-32 within the regex engine, with a
[hybrid](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07859.html)
bitmap, binary lookup scheme for character classes, similar to the way
that Perl 5 does. Jarkko suggested using an [inversion
list](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg07884.html).

This discussion is ongoing, so there'll be more to report next week with
this, too.

### [The Parrot Spotlight]{#The_Parrot_Spotlight}

Most folks already have an [inkling](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/people)
of what Larry Wall, [Damian Conway](http://www.yetanother.org/damian/),
[Dan Sugalski](http://www.yetanother.org/dan/), and Simon Cozens have
been doing for Perl 6 and Parrot, so we're going to pad space with some
brief introductions to some of the other Parrot Troopers getting things
done.

Daniel Grunblatt is a 21 year old university student in Argentina. He's
been working in Perl for several years, but Parrot is his first time
working on Perl internals. He's the creator of Parrot's JIT compiler,
and also plays basketball and role-playing games.

### [Parroty Bits]{#Parroty_Bits}

The [Perl Development Grant Fund](http://donate.perl-foundation.org)
exceeded \$80,000, thanks to sizable contributions from
[DynDNS](http://www.dyndns.org), [pair Networks](http://pair.com), and
[SAGE](http://www.usenix.org/sage/).
