Welcome to another Perl 6 summary. This summary explores such thrilling
issues as multi-dimensional slices of Chinese food. After all, the
amount of sauce any piece of Chinese food can absorb is proportional to
its surface area, which is a direct function of the number of dimensions
in which you slice it (provided that we ignore degenerate cases such as
fractal cuts of Peking duck).

### Perl 6 Language

#### [1x6 vs 6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/96503cca52fd9c56/143ada0ec06bb3d6?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#143ada0ec06bb3d6)

Craig DeForest wondered how to disambiguate a 1x6 2D array slice from a
6 element 1D array slice. He suggested a syntax inspired by PDL. Larry
admitted to not having examined this particular issue and stated that he
was open to suggestions. Some suggestions arrived.

#### Code as Comment

StÃ©phane Payrard wanted to know if there is an easy way to alias
arguments to a function, thus allowing a longer version for readability
when calling the function and a short version inside the function. Larry
suggested `$s is named<subject>`, which I like. The thread then devolved
into punning in French.

### Perl 6 Compiler

#### Pascal -&gt; Pcode -&gt; Parrot -&gt; Profit

Sven Schubert asked about the feasibility of putting Pascal on Parrot.
He noted that with the infrastructure mentioned in "Perl 6 and Parrot
Essentials," the problem would not be too bad. Apparently, "Essentials"
makes a few promises that we have yet to live up to, but we are working
towards it. In the meantime, StÃ©phane Payrard suggested a way for him to
kill two birds with one stone: Pcode.

#### [Grammar Improvements](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/af402d8eaa2595f5/709e2b99e7df1547?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#709e2b99e7df1547)

Luke Blanshard submitted some rules for Perl6::Grammar. Luke Palmer
committed a slight variation of his work, and the hacking commences...

### Parrot

#### [`pop_pad`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/98354eb8d0d4ad70/04dcf794b58ef4a0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#04dcf794b58ef4a0)

Peter Christopher wondered why `pop_pad` had not been implemented last
week. This week, Leo implemented it and asked for tests.

#### [Resizable Arrays](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f7fa725341795347/930c3b4d1c0a5f44?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#930c3b4d1c0a5f44)

Simon Glover asked why ResizablePMCArray was so different from all of
its Resizable\*Array bretheren. The answer is that Leo improved it. This
brings up an obvious task for someone looking for a reasonably friendly
chunk of Parrot to work on. Rationalizing the implementation of the
various Resizable\*Arrays would probably be a good task for a novice
looking to dig into something. Perhaps one who is on winter break...

#### [Parrot 0.1.1 NCI Troubles](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d8dfa0fafe02dedb/8b10b2c544763410?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#8b10b2c544763410)

Ian Joyce noticed that Parrot 0.1.1 had some trouble with *nci.t*. Leo
admitted that this was the case but that the CVS version works.

#### [Test or Benchmark](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/691a2601522351b8/e78069511d71c018?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e78069511d71c018)

Nicholas Clark wondered if *resizablestringarray.t* was actually a
benchmark, because it had a big number which was really hurting his poor
machine. Simon Glover admitted to the copy/paste error.

#### [x86 Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.7](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9500522899e1947b/d074ce8ab3a62a63?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d074ce8ab3a62a63)

Andy Bach and Nicholas Clark worked towards making Parrot happier on the
aforementioned architecture. This thread seemed to peter out when
Nicholas asked, "How do we run a callback unconditionally after
gccversion is known, independent of its value?"

#### [`VTABLE_call_method`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8aae892b30afa338/aa30e97030cae110?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#aa30e97030cae110)

Leo and Sam had a disagreement about whether a `call_method` vtable
entry makes sense. I think that we are waiting for higher
intervention...

#### [Updated *perlhist.txt*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/22bfbb14721de0ae/5c5636ab4ee74101?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#5c5636ab4ee74101)

Will Coleda applied Bernhard's patch updating *perlhist.txt* and
*streams.t*.

#### [Warnock Warnocked](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0034a7409597efbd/26896bd124b55178?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#26896bd124b55178)

Will Coleda applied the long Warnocked update to Warnock's contact
information with only a trace of irony.

#### [gcov of *perlarray.pmc* reaches 100%](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/cfeeb0ef3dde12e2/cdae29a89b1d92fd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#cdae29a89b1d92fd)

Simon Glover produced full test coverage for *perlarray.pmc*. Nifty.
Some brave soul (possibly fitting an earlier description) should try
this with the Fixed\*Arrays...

#### [Parrot Under Solaris 9](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/29ef269bdd16cb75/4f694b44349d51af?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#4f694b44349d51af)

Nicholas Clark, Andy Doughery, and Christian Aperghis-Tramoni all tried
to convince Parrot to work on Solaris. They are brave souls.

#### parrot-config Updates

Peter Christopher asked questions about *parrot-config.imc*. He also
provided an initial solution.

-   [questions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/55ea99da3b3804d6/0fca617bc5a38f44?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#0fca617bc5a38f44)

#### [Key Question](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c52d8b7fb46e4ebc/e3751681e70f1c9c?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e3751681e70f1c9c)

Simon Glover noticed some bad behavior with respect to Key PMCs. Leo and
Sam both admitted that it was bad and that they need some work.

#### [Parrot PDL](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/46014b8262325b39/ac1d0b1889657d86?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#ac1d0b1889657d86)

Bernhard Schmalhofer posted a pointer to PDL. Luke Palmer pondered
Piddles as Parrot PMCs. Craig DeForest proposed a path passing through
PDL's PP and pausing at Parrot. (Perhaps the preponderance of Ps in
Perl, Parrot, and Python should push me to alliterate with another
available letter.)

#### [Parrot Syntax Engine](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6c638108bf813c3f/54b769e955cedae1?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#54b769e955cedae1)

Henrik Gulbrandsen introduced the powerful Parrot Syntax Engine. Leo
asked a few questions to which Henrik provided answers. All in all, it
looks really cool and makes me a little jealous that I did not develop
the Tomita algorithm first.

#### [`s/libnci.so/libnci_test.so/g`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6c5ada8ac62b3599/98645416ee9d7b0a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#98645416ee9d7b0a)

Bernhard Schmalhofer moved *libnci.so* to *libnci\_test.so*, as it
really is for testing. Leo applied the patch.

#### [Segfaulting `readline`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0697a38c020c9142/8793d3ef6ed74697?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#8793d3ef6ed74697)

Matt Diephouse managed to segfault Parrot using `readline`. Leo fixed
it. Matt pointed out a new bug that it introduced.

#### [Substrings of Invalid Ranges](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ce98e6dd1754a27c/4d536284ff2a9043?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#4d536284ff2a9043)

Matt Diephouse noticed that taking a substring of an invalid range had
odd results. Simor Glover provided a bunch of tests for it. Leo applied
the patch but mentioned that these corner cases need an authoritative
hammering.
