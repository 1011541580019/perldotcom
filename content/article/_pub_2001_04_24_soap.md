You shouldn't have many problems with the CGI-based SOAP server you created in the [first part of this article](/pub/2001/01/soap.html); however, performance could be significantly better. The next logical step might be to implement SOAP services using accelerators (like PerlEx or VelociGen) or persistent technologies (like mod\_perl). Another lightweight solution might be to implement the SOAP service as an HTTP daemon; in that case, you don't need to use a separate Web server. This might be useful in a situation where a client application accepts SOAP calls, or for internal usage.

**<span id="item_HTTP_daemon">HTTP daemon</span>**
  
The following code shows an example implementation for a HTTP daemon:

4.a. server (HTTP daemon)

     #!perl -w

      use SOAP::Transport::HTTP;

      use Demo;

      # don't want to die on 'Broken pipe' or Ctrl-C
      $SIG{PIPE} = $SIG{INT} = 'IGNORE';

      $daemon = SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon
        -> new (LocalPort => 80)
        -> dispatch_to('/home/soaplite/modules')
      ;

      print "Contact to SOAP server at ", $daemon->url, "\n";
      $daemon->handle;
