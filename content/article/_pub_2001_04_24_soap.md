### [More Complex Server (daemon, mod\_perl and mod\_soap)]{#more complex server (daemon, mod_perl and mod_soap)}

You shouldn't have many problems with the CGI-based SOAP server you
created in the [first part of this
article](/media/_pub_2001_04_24_soap/soap.html); however, performance
could be significantly better. The next logical step might be to
implement SOAP services using accelerators (like PerlEx or VelociGen) or
persistent technologies (like mod\_perl). Another lightweight solution
might be to implement the SOAP service as an HTTP daemon; in that case,
you don't need to use a separate Web server. This might be useful in a
situation where a client application accepts SOAP calls, or for internal
usage.

**[HTTP daemon]{#item_HTTP_daemon}**\

:   The following code shows an example implementation for a HTTP
    daemon:

    4.a. server (HTTP daemon)

         #!perl -w

          use SOAP::Transport::HTTP;

          use Demo;

          # don't want to die on 'Broken pipe' or Ctrl-C
          $SIG{PIPE} = $SIG{INT} = 'IGNORE';

          $daemon = SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Daemon
            -> new (LocalPort => 80)
            -> dispatch_to('/home/soaplite/modules')
          ;

          print "Contact to SOAP server at ", $daemon->url, "\n";
          $daemon->handle;
