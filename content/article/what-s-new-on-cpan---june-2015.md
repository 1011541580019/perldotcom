Welcome to "What's new on CPAN", a curated look at last month's new CPAN uploads for your reading and programming pleasure. Enjoy!

### Module of the month

[Class::Storage]({{<mcpan "Class::Storage" >}}) is a module for serializing blessed references (objects). Once serialized, an object can be transmitted via JSON, XML, YAML or saved in a data store. Serializing objects can also make IPC easier: coroutines, threads and other processes can pass text but blessed references are often an issue.

Module author Peter Valdemar MÃ¸rch has pulled together excellent documentation. A welcome addition to CPAN, check out the [acknowledgements section]({{<mcpan "Class::Storage#ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" >}}) for some interesting background on the module. For an alternative approach, you might be interested in [Object::Serializer]({{<mcpan "Object::Serializer" >}}). For non-readable serializers, checkout [Storable]({{<mcpan "Storable" >}}) and the newer and faster [Sereal]({{<mcpan "Sereal" >}}).

**Important** - when working with object serializers like Class::Storage, only deserialize trusted data, as malicious code can be injected into the data, and when the data is deserialized, the code will be executed automatically. See for example this bug [report](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=105772) (*Thanks to Reini Urban for the reminder*).

### APIs & Apps

-   [API::Zendesk]({{<mcpan "API::Zendesk" >}}) provides a Perl interface for the customer support app
-   Painlessly install libsvm, the support vector machine library using [Alien::LIBSVM]({{<mcpan "Alien::LIBSVM" >}})
-   Use Slack? Of course you do. Check out [AnyEvent::SlackRTM]({{<mcpan "AnyEvent::SlackRTM" >}})
-   Develop your first Slack bot with [Bot::Backbone::Service::SlackChat]({{<mcpan "Bot::Backbone::Service::SlackChat" >}})!
-   [Interchange::Search::Solr]({{<mcpan "Interchange::Search::Solr" >}}) let's you use Solr search with Perl
-   Be popular, send your co-workers Bonusly with [WebService::Bonusly]({{<mcpan "WebService::Bonusly" >}})
-   [WebDriver::Tiny]({{<mcpan "WebDriver::Tiny" >}}) is an all-new implementation of a Selenium webdriver API for Perl

### Config & DevOps

-   [Config::App]({{<mcpan "Config::App" >}}) implements "cascading configurations" - looks like a convenient way to have context-specific configurations without resorting to Perl code
-   Quickly rind files on your Mac using [Mac::FindFile]({{<mcpan "Mac::FindFile" >}})
-   [Perl::Critic::Freenode]({{<mcpan "Perl::Critic::Freenode" >}}) is a compilation of policies recommended by the folks on the \#perl channel on freenode IRC
-   Include ditaa diagrams in pod with [Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Ditaa]({{<mcpan "Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Ditaa" >}})

### Data

-   Extract data from your Zoom 5341J cable modem with [Device::CableModem::Zoom5341J]({{<mcpan "Device::CableModem::Zoom5341J" >}})
-   [Log::Dispatch::HipChat]({{<mcpan "Log::Dispatch::HipChat" >}}) will send your log messages to HipChat
-   Moving averages are easy to implement, and easy to get wrong. The next time you need one, consider [Math::SMA]({{<mcpan "Math::SMA" >}})
-   If you're working with 35mm film and DX codes, you might like [Photography::DX]({{<mcpan "Photography::DX" >}})

### Development and Version Control

-   When stuck in Git merge conflict hell, sometimes it's easier to say "I'm right". [App::Git::Workflow::Command::Take]({{<mcpan "App::Git::Workflow::Command::Take" >}}) let's you tell Git to merge your changes. You win!
-   If you have a load of Git repos that you'd like to execute a command against, you might like [App::Multigit]({{<mcpan "App::Multigit" >}})
-   [Assert::Conditional]({{<mcpan "Assert::Conditional" >}}) from Tom Christiansen let's you conditionally compile assertions into your Perl programs, ala C's assert.h. Wow
-   Daemonize *anything* with [JIP::Daemon]({{<mcpan "JIP::Daemon" >}})

### Text & Language

-   [Acme::Unicodify]({{<mcpan "Acme::Unicodify" >}}) can convert ASCII text into Unicode-esque characters
-   [Crypt::RS14\_PP]({{<mcpan "Crypt::RS14_PP" >}}) is a pure Perl implementation of the RS14 encryption algorithm
-   Convert HTML into FreeStyleWiki markup using [HTML::WikiConverter::FreeStyleWiki]({{<mcpan "HTML::WikiConverter::FreeStyleWiki" >}})
-   Awesome! detect the language with [Lingua::Identify::CLD2]({{<mcpan "Lingua::Identify::CLD2" >}})
-   [Text::Hogan]({{<mcpan "Text::Hogan" >}}) is a Perl clone of hogan.js, the JavaScript template engine. Supports pre-compilation!

### Science and Mathematics

-   [Algorithm::BloomFilter]({{<mcpan "Algorithm::BloomFilter" >}}) is a simple, superfast bloom filter implementation written in XS
-   Not a new module, but it is new to CPAN, [App::Chart]({{<mcpan "App::Chart" >}}) the visual charting library is useful
-   [BioX::Workflow]({{<mcpan "BioX::Workflow" >}}) is an "opinionated template based workflow writer", hailing from the Bioinformatics World, but not just for BioX
-   The Longest Common Subsequence algorithm is used for diffing text, among other uses. [LCS::XS]({{<mcpan "LCS::XS" >}}) is a supercharged version, written in XS

### Web

-   Extract all of the supported URLs from your Catalyst app using [Catalyst::Plugin::ActionPaths]({{<mcpan "Catalyst::Plugin::ActionPaths" >}}) (disclosure, I'm the module author)
-   [Dancer::Plugin::Piwik]({{<mcpan "Dancer::Plugin::Piwik" >}}) helps you integrate Pwik analytics with a Dancer app
-   Use MongoDB with Minion, the job queue application using [Minion::Backend::MongoDB]({{<mcpan "Minion::Backend::MongoDB" >}})
-   [Mojo::Reactor::UV]({{<mcpan "Mojo::Reactor::UV" >}}) let's you use the C library, libuv as the backend event loop for your Mojo application
-   Rapidly expand shortened URLs with [WWW::Expand::More]({{<mcpan "WWW::Expand::More" >}}). Cool!

Updated to include other example serializer modules and deserialization warning - 2015-07-09
