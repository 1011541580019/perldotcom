Last month Yet Another Perl Conference 19100 was held at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I promised a conference report
when I got back, but once again found that I couldn't really write it
myself, because I had been a speaker and so had missed a lot of the
things that went on outside of my own events.

While trying to decide whom to get to write the report instead, I
realized that I was tired of conference reports written by one person.
Instead, I followed the pattern of one of the conference's big
successes, the Lightning Talks, and asked about twenty people to each
contribute a very short report on one or two aspects of the conference.

The reports follow. For more information about YAPC, visit
<http://www.yapc.org/.> Also note that the first YAPC::Europe conference
is coming up in London in September.

### [Schuyler D. Erle]{#schuyler d. erle}

The first big highlight was probably Larry Wall's opening speech on
Bunyan's *The Pilgrim's Progress* and the development of perl, but I
found the talk's concluding Q&A portion really unforgettable. Someone
asked Larry what the first thing was that he would go back and change
about perl, given the chance. His answer was succinct: The return value
of `system()`. \`"Obviously," he announced, "If you want to succeed, be
true."

Friday's big excitement was mjd's Lightning Talks, a sort of Conference
Proceedings for the Attention Span Impaired. A lot of people turned out
to see the five-minute talks, most of which were really well delivered.
Amazingly, all of the speakers kept to their allotted time, as marked by
Dominus with a gong he seemed to have mysteriously acquired for that
purpose. The highlights of the Talks were universally accorded to be Nat
Torkington's twin discourses on "A Day in the Life of p5p" and "What is
it with those Python fucks, anyway?", the latter of which was thoroughly
tongue-in-cheek, absolutely hilarious, and it's too damn bad for you if
you missed it because Nat has, apparently in the interests of peace,
refused to make the text of the speech public. "Of course our wheel is
square. It's easier to measure that way."

But, as always, the best part about YAPC is the people. After Friday's
proceedings, I, with every intention of going down to Forbes Av. and
getting too drunk to walk back to the dorms, instead happened upon what
apparently started out as an idle chat with Larry and Sean Burke and mjd
and a few others, and became this mad informal panel discussion in the
lounge that started with the genus of shellfish the Phoenician used for
dye and somehow ended up moving from there to the philology of Lisp and
Cobol to the decipherment of the *Codex Seraphinianus* and beyond,
digressing continually for all kinds of other esoteric insanity. I
mostly sat and listened, utterly fascinated. I never did make it out to
the bars. I swear, the perl community is a bright lot, and, boy, YAPC is
a great place to get a healthy dose of humility. Thank God it only
happens once a year.

### [Avi]{#avi}

For me, YAPC started around 9:00 on Wednesday, June 22nd. I showed up a
bit too late to catch Kevin Lenzo's introductory talk, but just in time
to catch Mark-Jason Dominus' talk on strong typing, an interesting talk
about the pitfalls and triumphs of typing systems in various programming
languages. Mr. Dominus is an incredible speaker, and even while he was
clearly quite exhausted, the talk was very interesting.

After this talk, I hopped over the Randal Schwartz's "Learning Perl"
room for about an hour. Now I can't say how good this talk is for perl
beginners, not having been one myself for quite a while, but I always
like to go see Randal speak for at least a little while at these
conferences. Every time I go, I learn something new about perl that I
just hadn't noticed before. For example, at YAPC I learned about the
return value of `print` and the behaviour of `reverse(@)`. However, I
can only last about an hour before the dreadful jokes and
auctioneer-style patter start to really get to me.

After lunch I returned to the Dominus room where the famed "Wizards"
talk was getting under way. In just under an hour and a half, I learned
an immense amount about globs, knobs, references and other sundries that
go on under the cover of the stash. Unfortunately, shortly after the
final break for the day had begun, I was again overcome by anxiety and
had to leave. I spent the rest of YAPC at home and at work, but I hear
it was also very cool.

### [Gene Boggs: Day 2]{#gene boggs: day 2}

Woke up and made for the shower to catch Larry Wall's opening talk,
stopping only to smile as Larry and backpack walked silently by.

Got to the auditorium (after wolfing down excellent catered YAPC
breakfast of fresh fruit and bagels), sat by mjd, and listened to Larry
speak through the allegorical adventures of Christian in the book,
"Pilgrims Progress."

### [Sean M. Burke]{#sean m. burke}

Listening to a Damian Conway talk (whether about OOP, or about quantum
programming) is like going to an old-time Grateful Dead show: it goes on
hours longer than expected, but by even halfway through you're tripping
too hard to care.

John Orwant's talk discussed concepts of copyright by pointing out
design features of things (an ashtray, an ice bucket, a lamp!) that he
snuck out of his hotel room -- using stolen property to explain
intellectual property.

As to the post-talk festivities: There's not many conferences you can go
to where people, once a bit drunk, will declare how delicious the word
"ontogenesis" is, swap tips on where to get a copy of the *Codex
Seraphinianus*, and then go make fun of whatever's on ESPN.

### [Uri Guttman]{#uri guttman}

-   highlight: quiet dinner with 2 friends on saturday night after it
    was all over in a very nice place overlooking pittsburgh.
-   lowlight: seeing bill in a hooters top.
-   in between light: picture of me and hooter girl
-   fun moment: wading in hotel lobby fountain at 3am.
-   best talk no one understood: damian's quantum superposition.
-   best bof no one came to: dual giant screens of the marx brothers'
    horsefeathers.
-   nicest ending: lightning talks that were cut off before you got
    bored or too much information.
-   best new friend: jasmine.
-   best previous friend: damian.
-   most rigged raffle: perl mongers (dha won the cpu).
-   `#perl` moments: getting to know faces and voices to attach to all
    those nicks.
-   most violent talk: damian's advanced klingon objects
-   cool thing: logging in to home box via ssh and reading mail in
    emacs.
-   best drink: mad mex fresh raspberry margarita

### [Brad Murray]{#brad murray}

YAPC was an interesting mix of brilliant, delightful, vulgar, pompous,
engaging, boring, and fun people. I say people, because the people
eclipsed the event proper. When I think about what talks I went to see
and why, I realize that I went to see a certain person speak and not to
see a certain topic elaborated. So what we had was essentially a huge
multi-day all-night technical bull-session with a wide variety of
people, led by the cream of the crop. Well, frankly, what could be more
fun for a crowd of geeks?

Yes, fun. Sure, I justified all my expenses as training costs to my
employer, but at the end of the day we had a lot of fun. Certainly some
great things were learned, but mostly contact was made with plenty of
smart people and we had a good time doing it. What I remember most
vividly, for example, are events that happened far from the conference
schedule:

:   Discussing the autism and language with Larry Wall, Sean Burke, and
    Mark-Jason Dominus at some terrible hour in the crossroads of the
    dormitory.

:   Having my room invaded by several luminaries for an impromptu
    discussion on Perl, the universe, and Space Ghost at 3am while
    trying to prepare slides for my talk the next day.

:   Being discretely offered computing services in the wee hours by
    folks who should know better but feel that getting Larry on-line at
    4am is more important than the rules.

:   Being offered long distance cell phone time from a large number of
    caring \#perl folks so that I could call home and talk to the
    sweetheart we had to leave behind for the week.

:   Throwing a frisbee on the lawn with Perl people when it was so dark
    that the disk could not be seen until it was 2 meters from your
    face.

I'd chew off my own leg before missing the next one.

### [Lisa Nyman: Report from a First-time Presenter]{#lisa nyman: report from a firsttime presenter}

While I have presented papers at other conferences in the past, I have
always been nervous about presenting at a Perl conference. I thought no
one would find my work interesting or innovative. I was wrong.

YAPC was the ideal venue to discuss my latest project (the Census 2000
Internet Form) and all the open source issues related to its
development. Being a speaker opened up a lot of conversations with
people who, in their search for advocacy support, were curious about my
agency's work with Perl and open source. Someone asked me optimistically
"But is open source part of your agency's *strategic plan?*" Well, it
isn't, but that hasn't stopped us from depending on it.

So gather your ideas and start putting together your presentations for
next year. Use your local PerlMongers meetings as a proving ground. Take
advantage of the small crowds and congenial atmosphere of YAPC to get
your feet wet in the waters of the Perl conference circuit.

### [Clinton Pierce]{#clinton pierce}

Initially, I had two goals for YAPC. The first was to get in touch with
some of the Perl Culture that I've been missing out on. Second was to
learn some things about Perl that I really didn't know.

I attended Dick Hardt's "Programming for the People," and the talk
itself wasn't the part I found fascinating -- it was the audience. The
surprising thing was how heavily they (and Activestate!) rely on the
Perl Culture as a backbone. They want someone like Activestate to give
them polished tools. They need the gurus and "heavies" of the Perl
culture, if for nothing else to tell them where to go. For them, it's
not important that Perl is a swiss army chainsaw -- they're interested
in the service department, sales staff, and the user groups. They can't
get this level of support from any other toolset. And I agree
completely.

A lot of the new Perl I learned wasn't perl. First was MJD's talk on why
a strongly typed Perl doesn't have to suck. A lot of the talk was about
ML! It may seem out of place, but learning just enough ML to really see
the benefits of strong typing kind of makes me hope that Perl 6 has some
of that as an option. (I feel so dirty!) The JAPH talk that I went to
wasn't really Perl either. It was terribly perverse laughing at how Perl
can be molded to even the most twisted of minds (Hi Abigail!). If you've
never been able to decode a JAPH before, find Abigail's slides on the
Web and learn frightening things about the language you THOUGHT you
knew.

\[Abigail's JAPH talk slides are available at
<http://ucan.foad.org/~abigail/Perl/Talks/Japhs/> --D.\]

### [Nathan Torkington]{#nathan torkington}

Getting to YAPC was miserable. United screwed me over a ticket change,
so I had to pay \$700 at the last minute for tickets on Vanguard. They
ran late, I missed my bus on the return trip, and so on. Bah.

I had a great time at the conference proper, oh yes. I got to see all my
friends, catch some great talks, and have some fun giving talks.

Friends. Standout evening: getting toasted at the church brewpub
(http://www.churchbrew.com/) on Saturday night. Other highlights:
discussing the philosophy of OO and teaching OO with Damian Conway and
Joseph Hall; sitting around the hotel bar in the evenings with Jarkko
Hietaniemi, Elaine Ashton, Sean Burke, Jon Orwant, and Mik Firestone,
yammering about everything until the wee hours; Mik's killer hooch
(home-aged lemon and vodka); Elaine's whiskey; the trip to Falling Water
on Saturday with Jon and Damian.

Other people's talks. Damian's Quantum Superpositions talk was stellar,
even if it did lead to tedious repetition of the phrase "in constant
time" afterward. Jon's Apocalypse talk was a fine continuation from last
year's. Adam Turoff's Quizzo was a lot of fun (I'm not just saying that
because our fabulous team placed) and I hope we see it again next year.
The lightning talks were cosmic and I liked them so much I'm going to
beg Mark-Jason to do them next year at TPC.

My talks. My three hour tutorial on "The Seven Stages of a Perl
Programmer," based on a great post Tom Christiansen made to
perl5-porters in 1997 was fun. I gave two 20-minute talks on advocacy
and the uniqueness of Perl, while my head spun from cold medicine. And I
gave two five-minute lightning talks, one satirizing the perl5-porters
mailing list, and the other a Dennis Miller-style rant against the
over-zealous Python advocacy I've seen lately. Notes for all my talks,
except the Python rant, are at <http://prometheus.frii.com/~gnat/yapc/>.

Summary: a blast. Can't wait to do it again. Great job, Kevin!

### [Adam Turoff]{#adam turoff}

While at YAPC this year, I would look around every so often and wonder
if the conference program was an elaborate ruse to get nearly 400 Perl
programmers together to sit and chat.

One discussion I had on the way to dinner was about what's broken with
CPAN. One of the points mentioned was that Perl in general and CPAN in
particular does not accept multiple competing implementations of
modules. On the one hand, it sounds like a violation of TMTOWTDI, but on
the other hand, CPAN symbolizes The Perl Way. Playing with this idea in
detail, I began to realize that there's a zeroth law that supercedes
TMTOWTDI: Perl encourages sharing and collaboration over standardization
and competition.

Over another chat, I met Ranga Nathan, a Perl programmer who spends a
lot of time with COBOL code. We talked about a decent number of issues,
and found an example of a point Nat Torkington made during one of his
talks. When Perl doesn't go whole-hog into OOP or CORBA, it could be a
sign that these bloated technologies are really unnecessary for solving
real-world problems. People like Ranga who are coming out of the glass
house of mainframes are coming into Perl and skipping pass objects and
multithreading, and finding themselves happy and productive using Perl,
ignoring all of the hype that comes with other languages.

### [Mark-Jason Dominus]{#markjason dominus}

I don't really remember much of what happened at YAPC. I took the redeye
in from San Diego and arrived at about 6 AM the morning that the
conference began. Kevin told me that Joe had been delayed, and asked if
I would fill in for him, and for some reason I said "yes." I suppose
part of the reason is that I don't get very many opportunities to give
my talk on how *Strong Typing Doesn't Have to Suck*. I think the talk
went really well, because it requires that I jump up and down and froth
at the mouth and scream about how awful the type checking in Pascal is,
and it turns out that it's a lot easier to do that when I've just come
in on the redeye from San Diego.

The rest of the conference was a big blur for me. I gave twelve hours of
talks in two days, and then I made a midnight excursion with Abigail to
obtain the gong for the Lightning Talks. The next day I was signed up
for paintball, and as we were waiting for people to finish assembling so
we could leave, I suddenly realized that it just wasn't going to happen,
and I got my money back.

One of the paintballers took this picture just before they left:
