℞ 3: Declare source in UTF-8 for identiﬁers and literals
--------------------------------------------------------

Without the all-critical `use utf8` declaration, putting UTF‑8 in your literals and identiﬁers won't work right. If you used [the standard Perl Unicode preamble](/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-standard-preamble.html), this already happened. If you did, you can do things like this:

    use utf8;

     my $measure   = "Ångström";
     my @μsoft     = qw( cp852 cp1251 cp1252 );
     my @ὑπέρμεγας = qw( ὑπέρ  μεγας );
     my @鯉        = qw( koi8-f koi8-u koi8-r );
     my $motto     = "👪 💗 🐪"; # FAMILY, GROWING HEART, DROMEDARY CAMEL

If you forget `use utf8`, high bytes will be misunderstood as separate characters, and nothing will work right. Remember that this pragma only affects the interpretation of *literal* UTF-8 in your source code.
