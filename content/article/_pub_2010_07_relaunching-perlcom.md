Welcome to the new Perl.com! It's a great time to program Perl, and our
intent is that Perl.com can show off our language, libraries, and
community.

Thanks to Tom Christiansen, Tim O'Reilly, Greg Dickerson, Laura Painter,
Allen Noren, Ask Bjorn Hansen, Robert Spier, Leo Lapworth, Allison
Randal and a few more people I'm sure I've forgotten, Perl.com is now a
part of the Perl.org family. TPF has taken on editorial duties.

You should notice few changes; we've worked hard to preserve the
existing articles and URLs. More important, we'll publish new articles
and information again. My goal for the site is to post at least one
article a week on some aspect of Perl and its ecosystem.

If you have submissions or suggestions or requests, please let me know.
As well, we're planning for a visual revamp. Ideas are very welcome.

Welcome back to Perl.com.
