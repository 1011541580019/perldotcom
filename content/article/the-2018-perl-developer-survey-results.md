The second edition of the Perl Developer Survey took place from the 5th
of April until the 7th of May. Over 32 days we received 1024 responses
from all over the world, an improvement over last year's 849. There were
several changes including a few new questions and also a large number of
respondents from Japan who were almost completely absent in 2017.

Here are some of the highlights:

* 51.6% of respondents self taught in Perl

* 5.24 is the most popular Perl 5 version

* JavaScript and Bash are the most popular secondary technologies

* 9.6% of respondents work in Perl teams larger than 49 people

* Cambridge is the most popular city for Perl developers in the U.K.

* Vim is again the most popular text editor

* 70% of respondents have a positive outlook on the Perl community

\
**Q1 How long have you been using Perl 5?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image1.png"/>

| **Experience**    | **2017** | **2018** |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Less than 1 year  | 3.8%     | 2.7%     |
| 1-3 years         | 5.1%     | 5.1%     |
| 3-5 years         | 7.1%     | 7%       |
| More than 5 years | 84%      | 85.2%    |

At the experience level there are only slight changes in the *less than 1 year* and *more than 5 years* brackets.

\
**Q2 How did you start working in Perl?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image2.png"/>

This is a new question, we wanted to know how developers got into Perl and what are the most popular ways of learning Perl.

The most popular choice, 51% is *self taught*, followed by *on the job* with 37.7%. Basically non formal choices have the majority. *University* is third with 4.9%, which is unfortunate, but not surprising.

*Internships* are dead last with 2.5%. A lot of companies using Perl are in need of talent, but growing new developers through internships is not a popular choice. The *mention a few specific resources* section brought answers mostly related to books, Learning Perl, the Camel book/Programming Perl, courses, Perl Mongers etc.

\
**Q3 What resources would you recommend to someone new to Perl?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image3.png"/>

This question follows the same theme as the previous one, regarding resource and sources to learn Perl. Books are the most popular choice with **44.1%**, followed by tutorials with **33.4%** and training with **10.2%**.

The other section brought answers like: Geekuni, IRC, mailing lists, Perl Monks, source code, conferences and others.

\
**Q4 Have you tried Perl 6 or have any interest in trying it out in the future?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image4.png"/>

Here we have a slight change from 2017 that does not bode well for Perl 6, at least in this pool of respondents. The *yes* option dropped 9% from last year.

| **Answer**                    | **2017** | **2018** |
|-------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Yes                           | 46.1%    | 37.1%    |
| No                            | 13.7%    | 22.3%    |
| Maybe I'll check it out later | 39.6%    | 39.8%    |
| What's Perl 6?                | 0.6%     | 0.8%     |

\
**Q5 What Perl 5 version do you use?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image5.png"/>

The most popular version is 5.24, while the latest version, 5.26, is second to last. The other section had various responses, including older version like 5.8, 5.1. In 2017 there was also an *other* option with mixed responses.

*This was a multiple choice question.*

| **Perl 5 version** | **2017**  | **2018**                |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 5.26               | -         | 9% (from other section) |
| 5.24               | 29%       | 25.2%                   |
| 5.22               | 21%       | 17.5%                   |
| 5.20               | 10%       | 12.5%                   |
| 5.18               | 12%       | 12.8%                   |
| 5.16               | 9%        | 10.3%                   |
| 5.14               | 6%        | 7.9%                    |

\
**Q6 Is Perl 5 your main language?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image6.png"/>

**76.9%** of respondents use Perl as a main language, while **23.1%** don't, a 0.1% difference from last year, when 77% chose yes and 23% no.

\
**Q7 What other languages do you use?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image7.png"/>

| **Languages** | **2017 statistics**  | **2018 statistics**     |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|

| SQL           | 6.5%                 | 1% (from other section) |

The other section was quite diluted and contained responses like: Scala, Swift, Rust, Erlang, Perl 6, TypeScript, Lua, Fortran and others.

*This was a multiple choice question.*

\
**Q8 What methodologies do you use?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image8.png"/>

Methodologies correlate with how developers work and build software. That being said, **30.7%** of respondents chose the *none* option. Most of them work in various size companies, but in small Perl development teams, which somewhat explains their choice. In the *other* section we received responses like: TDD, continuous delivery, spiral and various hybrid versions.

Agile is the most popular methodologies, followed by Waterfall and Lean.

\
**Q9 Do you have a formal education in computer science?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image9.png"/>

Most respondents, **40.2%** don't have a formal education in the field. Almost a third or **32.1%** have a Bachelor degree, **14.3**% have a Masters degree and **2%** have a PhD.

In the other section we have responses like: mathematics, high school, engineering or incomplete degrees.

*This was a multiple choice question.*

\
**Q10 What's your type of employment?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image10.png"/>

\
**Q11 What's the size of the company you work for?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image11.png"/>

| **Company size** | **2017 statistics** | **2018 statistics** |

*1011 respondents answered this question*

\
**Q12 How large is the development team in the company?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image12.png"/>

| **Dev team size** | **Percentage** |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 1-5               | 35.2%          |
| 6-20              | 24.6%          |

| 100+              | 23.7%          |

We wanted to know large is the overall development team. About **60%** of development teams are under 20, while **23.7%** are larger than 100.

*1009 respondents answered this question*

\
**Q13 How large is the Perl team in the company?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image13.png"/>

| **Perl team size** | **Percentage** |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 1-3                | **52.9%**      |
| 4-10               | **22.5%**      |

| 26-49              | **5.9%**       |
| 49+                | **9.6%**       |

*991 respondents answered this question*

Not all respondents answered all three questions, hence there are small discrepancies between them, i.e they do not all add up to 100%.

This is the last question in a set. By comparing company size to development team size to Perl team size we wanted to know how significant is Perl in the development process.

**Development team size compared to company size**

![](/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/table1.png)

The 1000+ size bracket offers the most surprising result, **more than half** have quite large development team, with more than 100 people, but about **34%** also have very small dev teams, with less than 20 people.

**Perl team size compared to company size**

![](/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/table1.png)

Small Perl teams are the most popular choice, no matter of company size. Very large Perl teams, 49+, are found in the 100-1000 and 1000+ company size brackets, with **15.2%** and **16.6%** respectively.

**Perl team size compared to development team size**

![](/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/table1.png)

Comparing the Perl team size to the development team size shows how important is Perl as a technology. Most development teams contain small Perl teams, 1-3 and 4-10 Perl teams are the most popular choice. When it comes to large development teams (75-99 and 100+) Perl represents either a very small part, a 1-3 team/4-10 team or a very large part 49+.

For **large Perl development teams**, the **49+** bracket, the most popular countries are: the United States with **47%**, United Kingdom **16.8%**, the Netherlands **8.4%,** and Japan and France **4.2%** respectively.

\
**Q14 What's the field of the company?**

<img src="/images/the-2018-perl-developer-survey-results/image14.png"/>

Last year this question had a write in option, with a larger variety of answers that didn't all quantify to anything significant statistically speaking. Hence, this comparison shows some significant differences.

| **Field**   | **2017** | **2018** |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Services    | 6.3%      | 27%      |
| Development | 23%       | 19.6%    |
| Consulting  | 1.9%      | 9.3%     |

| Italy       | 1.2%      | 0.9%                      |

4.6% of respondents chose *None* as a location. The US again leads the board, followed by the UK and Germany. Japan makes an appearance as a large group of Perl developers joined this years' survey, while Brazil increased its percentage. The *other* section had a variety of locations as well.

**Most popular cities and states**

Perl developers in the United States are spread all over the country, California, New York, Texas and Michigan remain popular states.

In the UK, Cambridge leads with 19% of respondents, followed by London with 17%. In Germany, Berlin has 12%, followed by Munich with 11%. In Japan 60% of developers reside in Tokyo. In the Netherlands 30% of developers reside in Amsterdam. In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro Is the chosen location of 25% of respondents followed by São Paulo with 22.8% and Belo Horizonte with 14.2%

We only took into account cities with a significant percentage in each country.
