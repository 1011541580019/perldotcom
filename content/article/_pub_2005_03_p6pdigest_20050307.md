All\~

Welcome to yet another fortnight summary, once again brought to you by
chocolate chips. This does have the distinction of being the first
summary written on a Mac, so if I break into random swear words, just
bear with me.

### Off-list Development

In more related news, someone pointed out to me that development goes on
off-list on places like IRC. I briefly contemplated quitting my job and
tracking such things full time, but then I decided that it would be
better to accept brief submissions for the summary. Thus I will be
adding a fourth section to the summaries based on contributions. If you
would like to make a contribution, email me with a brief summary. Please
include the name by which you would like me to attribute you (though
sadly the process I use will likely to mangle any Unicode characters).
Please make all links full. I will shorten them. Thanks!

### Perl 6 Language

#### [`not()`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/b4e54da6dbda6a06/b0456cc980e83394#b0456cc980e83394)

It turns out that `not()` (with no arguments) made Perl 5 core dump for
a while, and it took us five years to figure that out. In Perl 6 it will
be a list op. Calling it with no arguments will return a null list or an
undef depending on context.

#### [Junctions and Threading](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/dc72f01f5027f048/48bdbca40022b21c#48bdbca40022b21c)

I had hoped that last week someone would have addressed the concerns
about threading. I was disappointed in this. A new crop of concerns
surfaced and died down fairly quickly (as the chief proponent, Damian,
was away).

#### [Serializing to Various Languages](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/9b872c9ed83288e0/0ebbcd80853adf38#0ebbcd80853adf38)

Somehow the discussion of junctions morphed into a discussion of sets,
which morphed back into junctions, which morphed into a discussion of
serialization to different languages. Interesting stuff, but I wouldn't
hold my breath for it.

#### [Performance Analysis and Benchmarks](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/738187afa60b9f0b/f2f3a2da72c3046c#f2f3a2da72c3046c)

Adam Preble posted an offer to develop some benchmarks for Perl 6.
Unfortunately, I think he posted it to Google Groups. Also, he probably
should have posted it to p6c or p6i as the language folk tend to wave
their hands and say "magic occurs but correctness is preserved" when it
comes to optimization.

#### [Send + More = Junctions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/a6529a02c9846a0d/732df42c2d9be456#732df42c2d9be456)

Autrijus posted an example using junctions, instead of parents, to solve
the classic

> SEND MORE + ===== MONEY

problem. Markus Laire asked for a clarification, and Rod Adams pointed
out that he felt that it would not work as it did not capture the
interdependence of the "e"s. This lead to the question of how to write
Prolog-like code (including unification and backtracking) in Perl 6. No
one offered answers.

#### [Pairs as lvalues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/88aefa68ad27f426/71027b15d05582b0#71027b15d05582b0)

Ingo Blechschmidt wondered what the behavior of pairs as lvalues would
be. The answer is that you will receive an error for attempting to
modify a constant.

### [Perl 6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/cacd7e002c890924/fe2cfeb1b88ee1a2#fe2cfeb1b88ee1a2)

Roberto Bisotto wanted to know where he could download Perl 6 to start
playing with it. We embarrassedly told him that a full implementation
was not yet available, but Pugs was gaining ground quickly.

#### [Hash Keys](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/be23b9d50b6559cc/4903cb1bd620edda#4903cb1bd620edda)

Autrijus wanted to know if hash keys were still just strings or if they
could be more. The answer is that by default they are strings, but you
can declare them as having a different ` shape `. This led to a
discussion of hashing techniques such as the `.bits`, `.canonicalize`,
or `.hash` methods.

#### [Dynamically-Scoped Dynamic Scopes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/9921c45f21ab8a3e/499d9f24e128dbac#499d9f24e128dbac)

Dave Whipp wanted to make "dynamically-scoped dynamic scopes". My head
hurt, but apparently Larry's didn't. He replied, "Piece of cake, the
syntax \[and implementation\] are left as an exercise for the would-be
module author."

#### [Parameters to Rules](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/be231afa0b134b41/e1f0673c86848f17#e1f0673c86848f17)

Rod Adams asked how he could specify arguments to rules so they could be
more function-like. Larry explained that there were several syntaxes,
each of which can coerce its arguments in slightly different ways. He
then mused that perhaps there were too many. I agree. There are too
many.

#### [Compile Time Signature Checking](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/6e72e481cee3393d/0066c3b36488fd26#0066c3b36488fd26)

Ahbijit Mahabal wondered how type checking will work for cases where it
is not easy to determine the types at compile time. The answer: checking
will be deferred to run time. In the end it seems that Perl 6 will blur
the line between run time and compile time heavily. Perhaps it will
provide nifty support for staged programming. Meta-Perl 6 here we come.

#### [`%*CONFIG` and `%?CONFIG`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/13ac45228fd4409f/56f3ea297b42a06c#56f3ea297b42a06c)

Brian Ingerson asked about the `CONFIG` hash and what sort of secondary
sigil it would have. Larry explained that `$?CONFIG` holds the config
for the machine compiling the program and `$*CONFIG` holds the config
for the machine running the program. Then he made some noise about
parsing, compiling, and running all on different machines. Then he
suggested that this way led to drug induced madness.

#### [Sigils and Structural Subtypes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/2d48d854b9cbe1a8/040055e6a076a77e#040055e6a076a77e)

Thomas Sandlaß proposed using sigils to provide a structural type system
as opposed to its class/signature-based one and its constraint-based
one.

#### [Optional Binding](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/086a99985beac390/3beae7ddd32a0cd6#3beae7ddd32a0cd6)

Luke Palmer wondered how optional arguments and slurpy ones would
interact. Brent and Larry explained that they would snap up whatever
arguments they could, but you can always beat them back by piping in
your slurpy stuff with ` ==> `.

#### [Types, Classes, and Junctions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/d8ab55b87c4c5066/d1881a598c201c32#d1881a598c201c32)

Thomas Sandlaß wants to know how the type system and the class system
interrelate. He drew a happy tree of A, B, and its junctions. Really it
confused me, and I agree with him that I don't understand the value of
the one junction in the context of types.

#### [Code Indentation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_thread/thread/bb118c7350c76657/b7a518c68403bf90#b7a518c68403bf90)

Wolverian does not like any of the ways he can indent his long function
declaration when it uses traits. He wants to allow a comma in them to
solve this dilemma. Larry and others suggested a few alternatives. This
led to a discussion of module loading and header/module files. Larry
admitted that he would not mind if Perl 6 developed Ada-like module
files.

### Perl 6 Compiler

#### Pugs Releases and patches

Autrijus released Pugs 6.0.9 and 6.0.10 with help from many people.

-   [6.0.9](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/110bfecca8f61260/926318dc6a8bfba5#926318dc6a8bfba5)
-   [6.0.10](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/6160392a79acfb39/7925028a26e8e036#7925028a26e8e036)

#### Various Pugs Patches

Luke Palmer added more `qq` delimiters and fixed a unary `-` bug. Yuval
Kogman posted a fix that made anonymous blocks both parse and run.
Stevan Little un-TODOed a bunch of tests that started working; he went
on to add some new tests that do not yet pass. I suspect that he is just
providing more for him to un-TODO later. Yuval Kogman submitted several
patches including array interpolation, a `CATCH {}` test, a test for an
assignment bug, and a fix for a conditional of expected. Garrett Rooney
cleaned up *given.t*, added a test for `%hash.kv`, one for declaring
variables in a loop, and another for `$?LINE` and `$?FILE`.

#### [Where to Post Things?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/854e1c954eee0aff/5d80e1f9dffd78b0#5d80e1f9dffd78b0)

Abhijit Mahabal wondered if p6c was the correct place to post questions
about Pugs and bugs in Pugs. Patrick and Autrijus agreed that p6c was
indeed the correct place for most initial questions. Things will
escalate to p6l only when the Apocalypses|Exegeses|Synopses are not
clear.

#### [Argument Binding Problems](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/e2a279655e5f0700/055c8989dba2dfb3#055c8989dba2dfb3)

Abhijit Mahabal found and analyzed a bug in Pugs argument binding. There
is no solution yet.

#### [No More Numeric Postfix Operators](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/d6b0ceec8702a2c2/251aae525ef31ee3#251aae525ef31ee3)

Due to the space-eating postfix dot, Larry declared that there would be
no numeric postfix operators. A great cry went out as if there had been
a huge disturbance in the force (or not).

#### [`&?SUB` and Pointy Subs](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/ebf76575a5b27f58/93ba223afa857539#93ba223afa857539)

Garrett Rooney was having trouble using the &?SUB variable in pointy
subs. That is because they don't use it. &?SUB is only for full-fledged
subs. That way you can call &?SUB from within a for loop in a sub and
get the nice recursive behavior you likely want.

#### [When is `$_` Set](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/6faead387ba8d754/c19a5c1095d1dbd7#c19a5c1095d1dbd7)

Autrijus asked Larry for clarification of which circumstances set `$_`.
Larry explained that `->` topicalizes its first argument but full subs
undefine it until something else sets it, while methods bind it to their
first invocant.

#### [Parens on Method Calls](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/310f00f3c793ebbc/aaf8af577ca231b8#aaf8af577ca231b8)

Luke Palmer was having trouble getting `for %hash.keys { ... }` to parse
correctly. Larry replied that it is problematic if methods parse in the
same manner as subs. Fortunately, the parens are mandatory when there
are arguments in addition to invocants.

#### [`@x = @a == @x = @a[]`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/88745bd19ee2408b/5c0b81012cd1c823#5c0b81012cd1c823)

Autrijus wanted to verify that

    my @x = @a;
    my @x = @a[];
    my @x[] = @a;

were all the same. Larry confirmed it.

#### [Misleading Compiler Messages](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/2cca457566ec6e31/532ba4fc2b7ba60b#532ba4fc2b7ba60b)

Terrence Brannon noticed a very confusing error message from Pugs.

#### [Integration Testing](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler?gvc=2)

Darren Duncan has offered to start the ball rolling with Perl 6
integration testing. He will translate a few modules he has written to
Perl 6 so that they can act as more holistic tests for Pugs and Perl 6.
There is an interesting conversation about CPAN and Perl 6 involved too.

#### [Refs in Scalar Context](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_thread/thread/cdb15361abe82075/caf5e64af3e9c337#caf5e64af3e9c337)

Stevan Little found a bug involving refs in scalar context.

### Parrot

#### [`Parrot_get_runtime_prefix`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/a218dc2b78cea569/7a4f18bec9be251a#7a4f18bec9be251a)

William Coleda found a bug in `Parrot_get_runtime_prefix`. Leo admitted
that it was a mistake.

#### [Z Machine](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/bf141f7bdf5b2bc9/1bc07cf6370561c5#1bc07cf6370561c5)

Leo put up his tiny Z machine for adoption. Steve Peters offered to
adopt it.

#### [MinGW Build](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/881e826e6bff40ad/7620ef482c7fb884#7620ef482c7fb884)

Michal Jurosz posted a link to his guide to [building Parrot with
MinGW](http://wiki.kn.vutbr.cz/mj/index.cgi?Build%20Parrot%20with%20MinGW).

#### [Splitting VTABLE into Interfaces](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/9ea5d132cb6a328b/6694c85f337d21b6#6694c85f337d21b6)

Leo and Sam posted their thoughts about splitting VTABLEs.

#### [Checking an Attribute's Existence](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/6a01356f6d07c89f/468a7048d6e6d20f#468a7048d6e6d20f)

Cory Spencer wants to check for the existence of an attribute, or at the
very least catch the exception thrown when an attribute is not found.
Leo told him that it was on the list of things to do.

#### [Calling C routines](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/7478b503bb00cace/3ce522b99f512582#3ce522b99f512582)

Vlad Florentino wanted to know if he could call C library routines from
Parrot. The answer is NCI. Look at the [Parrot SDL
bindings](http://search.cpan.org/~ltoetsch/parrot-0.1.2/runtime/parrot/library/SDL.imc)
as an example.

#### [heredoc for PIR](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/a25f9e51f5e893d5/c8dbea9600f28198#c8dbea9600f28198)

Bernhard Schmalhofer asked about adding heredoc support to PIR. This led
to Melvin ranting that PIR is not a language for people to write. PIR's
goal was to be to be an intermediate language targeted by compilers and
was not supposed to have human niceties like heredoc. Of course, for PIR
to reach that state, we need a high level language that actually targets
it.

#### [PPC Linux troubles](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/33d379077b32a52a/dce84b845fefd8c5#dce84b845fefd8c5)

Once more chromatic and Leo worked to try to fix Parrot for PPC Linux.

#### [Automatic Verification of Parrot Assembly](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/0785edb412d947b8/11a46c29f113b2ae#11a46c29f113b2ae)

Steve Coleman wants to develop a research project to verify assembly for
security purposes, thus he had some questions about Parrot Assembly.
Melvin happily provided some answers.

#### [Tail Call Improvements](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/f81a7fdd8efff573/3280f958d81855a9#3280f958d81855a9)

Bob Rogers supplied a patch that improved the `.tail_call` support in
IMCC. Leo applied it.

#### [Strings Support](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/1df03d9a27a03666/006aa1f97a89246e#006aa1f97a89246e)

Leo announced that he has merged Dan's string patch into the current CVS
head. Thanks go to Will Coleda for doing all the heavy lifting. String
content in assemblers now assume the iso-8859-1 charset, unless you
specify otherwise.

#### [Where Are Thou, Dan?](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/9639fe75600596b9/f35ecbe1eb110be2#f35ecbe1eb110be2)

Edward Peschko wondered where Dan was. Will Coleda provided the answer.
He is MIA.

#### [String Encoding Bug](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/b0e33017a867b530/ac6f56d4c1260f28#ac6f56d4c1260f28)

Bernhard Schmalhofer found a bug with string encoding in PBC files. Leo
fixed it.

#### [Parrot 0.1.2 "Pheonix", or, Counting is Fun](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/72895abfd4ba1867/cda0ac964ff089b0#cda0ac964ff089b0)

Leo proudly announced the release of Parrot 0.1.2. Thanks to everyone
for all your hard work.

#### [Test Suite Cleanup](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/88068795b1388146/c4828a3fdaf21fa9#c4828a3fdaf21fa9)

Bernhard Schmalhofer provided a large patch which cleans up some of the
test suite. Leo gave him the go ahead to apply it.

#### [Dynclasses Cleanup Wanted](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/3fd73e761f551ac8/a0623ecb52992ed5#a0623ecb52992ed5)

Leo posted a plea for a cleanup to dynclasses. There are no takers yet.

#### [Parrot Installer](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/861fca0f3baafaec/d6fd0922b5567ecc#d6fd0922b5567ecc)

Olivier Thauvin wants to make a Parrot RPM for Mandrake. Leo and Will
gave him pointers on where to start.

#### [Warnocked documentation patch](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/c04f3a326b0d745e/df79bca00f4bab84#df79bca00f4bab84)

Matt Diephouse wondered about the status of a patch he sent in. There is
still no response. ::nudge::

#### [Mac OS X Build Problem](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/6b9951a30622e444/c1bc9e1b53e14a76#c1bc9e1b53e14a76)

Will Coleda found an Mac OS X build problem. Leo slapped himself on the
forehead and fixed it.

#### [Strip the Strip](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_thread/thread/58d3f7458f4f9ae4/8da4b3d7e23dd9a0#8da4b3d7e23dd9a0)

Jarkko Hietaniemi posted a patch fixing a Tru64 build problem. Leo
applied it.
