In the [first article](/pub/a/2002/03/12/axkit.html) in this series, we
saw how to install, configure and test AxKit, and we took a look at a
simple processing pipeline. In this article, we will see how to write a
simple 10-line XSP taglib and use it in a pipeline along with XSLT to
build dynamic pages in such a way that gets the systems architects and
coders out of the content maintenance business. Along the way, we'll
discuss [the pipeline processing model](#why_pipelines) that makes AxKit
so powerful.

First though, let us catch up on some changes in the AxKit world.

### CHANGES

Matt and company have released AxKit v1.5.1, and 1.5.2 looks as though
it will be out soon. 1.5.1 provides a few improvements and bug fixes,
especially in the XSP engine discussed in this article. The biggest
additions are the inclusion of a set of demonstration pages that can be
used to test and experiment with AxKit's capabilities, and another
module to help with writing taglibs (Jorge Walter's
[SimpleTaglib](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-1.51/lib/Apache/AxKit/Language/XSP/SimpleTaglib.pm),
which we'll look at in the next article).

There has also been a release policy change: The main AxKit
distributions (AxKit-1.5.1.tar.gz for instance) will no longer contain
the minimal set of prerequisites; these will now be bundled in a
separate tarball. This policy change enables people to download just
AxKit (when upgrading it, for instance) and recognizes the fact that
AxKit is an [Apache project](http://xml.apache.org/) while the
prerequisites aren't. Until the prerequisite tarball gets released, the
[source tarball](/media/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/axkit_articles-2.0.tar.gz)
that accompanies this article contains them all (though it installs them
in a local directory only, for testing purposes). The main AxKit tarball
still includes all the core AxKit modules.

#### XSP and taglibs

We [touched on](/pub/a/2002/03/12/axkit.html?page=3) eXtensible Server
Pages and taglibs in the last article; this time we'll take a deeper
look and try to see how [XSP](http://axkit.org/docs/xsp/index.xml),
taglibs and XSLT can be combined in a powerful and useful way.

> A quick taglib refresher: A taglib is a collection of XML tags in an
> [XML namespace](http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm) that act like
> conditionals or subroutine calls. Essentially, taglibs are a way of
> encoding logic and dynamic content in to pages without including raw
> "native" code (Perl, Java, COBOL; any of the popular Web programming
> languages) in the page; each taglib provides a set of related services
> and multiple taglibs may be used in the same XSP page.

For our example, we will build a "data driven" processing pipeline
(clicking on a blue icon or arrow will take you to the relevant
documentation or section of this article):

[](#){#weather1_flow.png} ![weather1.xsp processing
pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow.png)
> ![Example icon](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_icon.png)
> NOTE: A little icon like this will be shown with the description of
> each piece of the pipeline with that piece hilighted. Clicking on
> those icons will bring you back to this diagram.

This pipeline has five stages:

1.  the XSP document ([`weather1.xsp`](#weather1.xsp)) defines what
    chunks of raw data (current time and weather readings) are needed
    for this page in a simple XML format,
2.  the XSP processor applies taglibs to assemble the raw data for the
    page,
3.  the first XSLT processor and stylesheet
    ([`weather.xsl`](weather.xsl)) format the raw data in to usable
    content,
4.  the second XSLT processor and stylesheet
    ([`as_html.xsl`](#as_html.xsl)) lays out and generates the final
    page ("Result Doc"), and
5.  the Gzip compressor automatically compresses the output if the
    client can comprehend compressed content (even when an older browser
    is bashful and does not announce that it can cope with gzip-encoded
    content).

[]{#mimicry}This multipass approach mimics those found in real
applications; each stage has a specific purpose and can be designed and
tested independently of the others.

In a real application, there might well be more filters: Our second XSLT
filter might be tweaked to build document without any "look and feel,"
and an additional filter could be used to implement the "look and feel"
of the presentation after the layout is complete. This would allow look
and feel to be altered independently of the layout.

> We call this a "data driven" pipeline because the document feeding the
> pipeline defines what data is needed to serve the page; it does not
> actually contain any content. Later stages add the content and format
> it. We'll look at a "document driven" pipeline, which feeds the
> pipeline with the document to be served, in the next article.

[]{#why_pipelines}
#### Why pipelines?

The XML pipeline-processing model used by AxKit is a powerful approach
that brings technical and social advantages to document-processing
systems lsuch as Web applications.

On the social side, the concept of a pipeline or assembly line is simple
enough to be taught to and grasped by nonprogrammers. Some of the
approaches used by HTML-oriented tools (like many on CPAN) are not
exactly designer-friendly: They rely on programmer-friendly concepts
such as abstract data structures, miniature programming languages,
"catch-all" pages and object-oriented techniques such as method
dispatch. To be fair, some designers can and do learn the concepts, and
others have Perl implementors who deploy these tools in simple patterns
that are readily grasped.

The reason that HTML-oriented tools have a hard time something as simple
as a pipeline model is that HTML is a presentation language and does not
lend itself to describing data structures or to incremental processing.
The advantage of incremental processing is that the number of stages can
be designed to fit the application and organization; with other tools,
there's often a one- or two-stage approach where the first stage is
almost entirely in the realm of the Perl coders ("prepare thedata") and
the second is halfway in the realm of the coders and halfway in the
designer's realm.

XML can be used both to describe data structures and mark up prose
documents; this allows a pipeline to mingle data and prose in flexible
ways. Each processing stage is XML-in, XML-out (except for the first and
last, which often consume and generate other formats). However, the
stages aren't limited to dealing purely with XML: The taglibs we're
using show one way that stages can use Perl code (and, by extension,
many other languages; see the
[Inline](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_perl/cpan-search?search=Inline%3A%3A)
series of modules), external libraries, and almost any non-XML data as
needed. Not only does My::WeatherTaglib integrate with Perl code, it's
also requesting data over the Internet from a remote site.

The use of XML as the carrier for data between the stages also allows
each stage to be debugged and unit tested. The documents that forwarded
between the stages are often passed as internal data structures instead
of XML strings for efficiency's sake, but they can be rendered (like the
examples shown in this article) and examined, both for teaching purposes
and debugging purposes. The uniform look and feel of XML, whatever it's
disadvantages, is at least readily understood by any competent Web
designer.

Pipelines are also handy mechanisms in that the individual stages are
chosen at request time; different stages can be selected to deliver
different views of the same content. AxKit provides several powerful
mechanisms for configuring pipelines, the `<xml-stylesheet ...>`
approach used in this article is merely the simplest; future articles
will explore building flexible pipelines.

Pipelines also make a useful distinction between the manager (AxKit) and
the processing technologies. Not only does this allow you to mix and
match processing techniques as needed (AxKit ships with nine
"Languages", or types of XML processor, and several "Providers", or data
sources), it also allows new technologies to be incorporated in to
existing sites when a new technology is needed.

Moreover, technologies like XML and XSLT are standardized and are
becoming widely accepted and supported. This means that most, if not all
the documents in our example pipeline can be handed off to non-Perl
coders without (much) fear of them mangling the code. When they do
mangle it; tools such as xsltproc (shipped with libxslt, one of the
AxKit XSLT processors) can be used to give the designers a first line of
defense before calling in the programmers. Even taglibs, nonstandard
though they are, leverage the XML standard to make logic and data
available to noncoders in a (relatively) safe manner. For instance,
[here's an excellent online
tutorial](http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XSLTutorial/Output/index.html)
provided by [ZVON.org](http://www.zvon.org/).

Mind you, XML and XSLT have their rough spots; the trick is that you
don't need to know all the quirky ins and outs of the XML specification
or use XSLT for things that are painful to do in it. I mean, really,
when was the last time you dealt with a [notation
declaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#Notations)? Most uses of XML
use a small subset of the XML specification, and other tools such as
XSP, XPathScript and various schema languages can be used where XSLT
would only make the problem more difficult.

What stages are appropriate depends on the application's requirements
and those of the organization(s) involved in building, operating and
maintaining it. In the next article, we'll examine a "document driven"
pipeline and a taglib better suited for this approach that uses
different stages.

All that being said there will always be a place for the non-XML and
non-pipelined solutions: XML and pipelines are *not* panaceas. I still
use other solutions when the applications or organizations I work with
would not benefit from XML.

[]{#httpd.conf}
#### `httpd.conf`: the AxKit configuration

Before we start in to the example code, let's glance at the AxKit
configuration. Feel free to [skip ahead to the code](#My::WeatherTaglib)
if you like; otherwise, here's the configuration we'll use in
`httpd.conf`:

[]{#httpd.conf2}
        ##
        ## Init the httpd to use our "private install" libraries
        ##
        PerlRequire startup.pl
        
        ##
        ## AxKit Configuration
        ##
        PerlModule AxKit
        
        <Directory /home/me/htdocs">
                Options -All +Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        
            # Tell mod_dir to translate / to /index.xml or /index.xsp
            DirectoryIndex index.xml index.xsp
            AddHandler axkit .xml .xsp
        
            AxDebugLevel 10
        
            AxGzipOutput Off
        
            AxAddXSPTaglib AxKit::XSP::Util
            AxAddXSPTaglib AxKit::XSP::Param
            AxAddXSPTaglib My::WeatherTaglib
        
            AxAddStyleMap application/x-xsp
                          Apache::AxKit::Language::XSP
        
            AxAddStyleMap text/xsl
                          Apache::AxKit::Language::LibXSLT
        </Directory>

This is the same configuration from the [the last
article](/pub/a/2002/03/12/axkit.html?page=2#testing)—most of the
directives and the processing model used by Apache and AxKit for them
are described in detail there. The two directives in **bold** have been
added. The key directives for our example are `AxAddXSPTaglib` and
`AxAddStyleMap`.

The `AxAddXSPTaglib` directives load three tag libraries: Kip Hampton's
[Util](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-XSP-Util-1.5/Util.pm)
and
[Param](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-XSP-Param-1.4/Param.pm)
taglibs and our very own [WeatherTaglib](#My::WeatherTaglib). Util will
allow our example to get at the system time; Param will allow it to
parse URLs; and WeatherTaglib will allow us to fetch the current weather
conditions for that zip code.

The two `AxAddStyleMap` directives map a pair of mime types to an XSP
and an XSLT processor. Our example source document will refer to these
mime types to configure instances of XSP and XSLT processors in to the
processing pipeline.

[]{#My::WeatherTaglib}
#### [![My::WeatherTaglib's position in the weather1.xsp processing pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_weather_taglib.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_weather_taglib.png} My::WeatherTaglib

Here's a taglib that uses
[Geo::Weather](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/Geo-Weather/Weather.html)
module on CPAN to take a zip code and fetch some weather observations
from [weather.com](http://weather.com/) and convert them to XML:

        package My::WeatherTaglib;
        
        $NS = "http://slaysys.com/axkit_articles/weather/";
        @EXPORT_TAGLIB = ( 'report($zip)' );
        
        use strict;
        use Apache::AxKit::Language::XSP::TaglibHelper;
        use Geo::Weather;
        
        sub report { Geo::Weather->new->get_weather( @_ ) }
        
        1;

This taglib uses Steve Willer's
[TaglibHelper](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-1.51/lib/Apache/AxKit/Language/XSP/TaglibHelper.pm)
(included with AxKit) to automate the drudgery of dealing with XML.
Because of this, our example taglib distills a lot of power into a few
lines of Perl. Don't be fooled, though, there's a lot going on behind
the curtains with this module.

When a tag like `<weather:report zip="15206"/>` is encountered in an XSP
page, it will be translated into a call to `report( "15206" )`, the
result of the call will be converted to XML and will replace the
original tag in the XSP output document.

The `$NS` variable sets the [namespace
URI](http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm) for the taglib; this
configures XSP to direct all elements within the namespace
`http://slaysys.com/axkit_articles/weather/` to My::WeatherTaglib, as
we'll see in a bit.

> When used in an XSP page, all XML elements supplied by a taglib will
> have a namespace prefix. For instance, the prefix `weather:` is mapped
> to My::WeatherTaglib's namespace in the XSP page below. This prefix is
> not determined by the taglib&8212;we could have chosen another; this
> section assumes that the prefix `weather:` is used for the sake of
> clarity.

The `@EXPORT_TAGLIB` specifies what functions will be exported as
elements in this namespace and what parameters they accept (see [the
documentation](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-1.51/lib/Apache/AxKit/Language/XSP/TaglibHelper.pm)
for details). The `report($zip)` export specification exports a tag that
is invoked like `<weather:report zip="..."/>` or

        <weather:report>
            <weather:zip>15206</weather:zip>
        </weather:report>

The words "report" and "zip" in the `@TAGLIB_EXPORT` definition are used
to determine the taglib element and attribute names; the order of the
parameters in the definition determines the order they are passed in to
the function. When invoking a taglib, the XML may specify the parameters
in any order in the XML. The names they are specified with are not
important to or visible from the Perl code by default (see the
[\*argument function
specification](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-1.51/lib/Apache/AxKit/Language/XSP/TaglibHelper.pm#FUNCTION_SPECIFICATIONS)
for how to accept an XML tree if need be).

All that's left for us to do is to write the "body" of the taglib by
`use()`ing `Geo::Weather` and writing the `report()` subroutine.

There are two major conveniences provided by TaglibHelper. The first is
welding Perl subroutines to XML tags (via the `@EXPORT_TAGLIB`
definitions). The second is converting the Perl data structure returned
by `report()`, a hash reference like

        {
          city  => "Pittsburgh",
          state => "PA",
          cond  => "Sunny",
          temp  => 76,
          pic   => "http://image.weather.com/web/common/wxicons/52/26.gif",
          url   => "http://www.weather.com/search/search?where=15206",
          ...
        }

in to [well
balanced](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-fragment#defn-well-balanced) XML
like:

          <city>Pittsburgh</city>
          <state>PA</state>
          <cond>Sunny</cond>
          <temp>76</temp>
          <pic>http://image.weather.com/web/common/wxicons/52/26.gif</pic>
          <url>http://www.weather.com/search/search?where=15206</url>
          ...

TaglibHelper allows plain strings, data structures and strings of
well-balanced XML to be returned. By writing a single one-line
subroutine that returns a Perl data structure, we've written a taglib
that requires no Perl expertise to use (any XHTML jock could use it
safely using their favorite XML, HTML or text editor) and that can be
used to serve up "data" responses for XML-RPC-like applications or
"text" documents for human consumption.

> The
> [Data::Dumper](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/Data-Dumper/Dumper.html)
> module that ships with Perl is a good way to peer inside the data
> structures floating around in a request. Wehn run in AxKit, a quick

> `$foo` to the Apache error log.

The output XML from a taglib replaces the orignal tag in the result
document. In our case, the replacement XML is not too useful as-is, it's
just data that looks a bit XMLish. Representing data structures as XML
may seem awkward to Perl gurus, but it's quite helpful if you want to
get the Perl code safely out of the way and allow others to use XML
tools to work with the data.

The "data documents" from our XSP processor will upgraded in later
processing stages to content that is presentable to the client; our XSP
page neither knows nor cares how it is to be presented. Exporting the
raw data as XML here is intended to show how to get the Perl gurus out
of the critical path for content development by allowing site designers
and content authors to do it.

Emitting structured data from XSP pages is just one approach. Taglibs
can return whatever the "best fit" is for a given application, whether
that be raw data, pieces of content or an entire article.

Here's a page (`weather1.xsp`) that uses the My::WeatherTaglib and the
"standard" XSP [util
taglib](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-XSP-Util-1.5/Util.pm)
we used in the previous article:

          <time>
            <util:time format="%H:%M:%S" />
          </time>
          <weather>
            <weather:report>
              <!-- Get the ?zip=12345 from the URI and pass it
                   to the weather:report tag as a parameter -->
              <weather:zip><param:zip/></weather:zip>
            </weather:report>
          </weather>

        </data>
        </xsp:page>

When `weather1.xsp` is requested, AxKit parses the
`<?xml-stylesheet ...?>` processing instructions and uses the
`AxAddStyleMap` directives to build the processing chain [shown
above](#weather1_flow.png).

[![My::WeatherTaglib's position in the weather1.xsp processing
pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_XSP.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_XSP.png}

The XSP processor is the first processor in the pipeline. As it parses
the page, it sends all elements with `util:`, `param:` or `weather:`
prefixes to the
[Util](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-XSP-Util-1.5/Util.pm),
[Param](http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSERGEANT/AxKit-XSP-Param-1.4/Param.pm),
and [WeatherTaglib](#My::WeatherTaglib) taglibs. This mapping is defined
by the `xmlns:...` attributes and by the namespace URIs that are
hardcoded into each taglib's implementation (see the `$NS` variable in
[My::WeatherTaglib](#My::WeatherTaglib)).

In this page, the `<util:time>` element results in a call to Util's
`get_date()` and the value of the `format=` attribute is passed in as a
parameter. The string returned by `get_date()` is converted to XML and
emitted instead of the `<util:time>` element in the output page. This
shows how to pass simple constant parameters to a taglib.

We're getting slightly trickier with the `<weather:report>` element:
This construct fetches the zip parameter from the request URI's query
string (or form field) and passes it to WeatherTaglib's `report()` as
the `$zip` parameter. Thanks to Kip Hampton for the help in using
AxKit::XSP::Param in this manner.

Because we have the `AxDebugLevel` set to `10`, you can see these calls
the compiled version of `weather1.xsp`; the generated Perl code is
written to Apache's error log—usually `$SERVER_ROOT/logs/error_log`.

The `<a name="title"/>` in the `<title>` element is a contrivance put in
this page to show off a feature later in the processing chain. Be glad
it's not the dreaded `<blink>` tag!

The XML document that is outputted from the XSP processor and fed to the
first XSLT processor looks like (taglib output in **bold**):

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <data>

#### []{#weather.xsl}[![My::WeatherTaglib's position in the weather1.xsp processing pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_weather_xsl.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_weather_xsl.png} `weather.xsl`: Converting Data to Content

\
Here's how we can convert the data document emitted by the XSP processor
into more human-readable text. As described [above](#mimicry), we're
taking a two-step approach to simulate a "real-world" scenario of
turning our data into chunks of content in one (reusable) step and then
laying the HTML out in a second step.

`weather.xsl` is an XSLT stylesheet that uses several templates to
convert the XSP output in to something more readable:

        <xsl:stylesheet 
          version="1.0"
          xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
        >
        
        <xsl:template match="/data/time">
          <time>Hi! It's <xsl:value-of select="/data/time" /></time>
        </xsl:template>
        
        <xsl:template match="/data/weather">
          <weather>The weather in
            <xsl:value-of select="/data/weather/city" />,
            <xsl:value-of select="/data/weather/state"/> is
            <xsl:value-of select="/data/weather/cond" /> and
            <xsl:value-of select="/data/weather/temp" />F
            (courtesy of <a href="{/data/weather/url}">The
            Weather Channel</a>).
          </weather>
        </xsl:template>
        
        <xsl:template match="@*|node()">
          <!-- Copy the rest of the doc verbatim -->
          <xsl:copy>
            <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
          </xsl:copy>
        </xsl:template>
        
        </xsl:stylesheet>

pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_XSLT1.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_XSLT1.png}
This is applied by the first XSLT processor in the pipeline.

The interesting thing here is that we are using *two* templates (shown
in bold) to process different bits of the source XML. These templates
"blurbify" the time and weather data in to presentable chunks and, as a
side-effect, throw away unused data from the weather report.

The third template just passes the rest through (XSLT has some annoying
qualities, one of which is that it takes a complex bit of code to simple
pass things through "as is"). However, this is boilerplate&8212;right
from the XSLT specification, in fact&8212;and need not interfere with
designers creating the two templates we actually want in this
stylesheet.

> Another annoying quality is that XSLT contructs look visually similar

processing
pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_XSLT1_out.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_XSLT1_out.png}
The output from the first XSLT processor looks like (template output in
**bold**):

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <data>
          <title><a name="title"/>My weather report</title>
          <time>Hi! It's 16:50:36</time>
          <weather>The weather in
            Pittsburgh,
            PA is
            Sunny and
            76F
            (courtesy of <a href="http://www.weather.com/search/search?where=15206">The
            Weather Channel</a>)
          </weather>
        </data>

Now we have a set of chunks that can be placed on a Web page. This
technique can be used to build sidebars, newspaper headlines, abstracts,
contact lists, navigation cues, links, menus, etc., in a reusable
fashion.

[]{#as_html.xsl}
#### [![My::WeatherTaglib's position in the weather1.xsp processing pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_as_html_xsl.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_as_html_xsl.png} `as_html.xsl`: Laying out the page

\
The final step in this example is to insert the chunks we've built into
a page of HTML using the `as_html.xsl`stylesheet:

        <xsl:stylesheet 
            xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
            version="1.0">

        <xsl:output method="html" />

        <xsl:template match="/">
          <html>
            <head>
              <title><xsl:value-of select="/data/title" /></title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <h1><xsl:copy-of select="/data/title/node()"   /></h1>
              <p ><xsl:copy-of select="/data/time/node()"    /></p>
              <p ><xsl:copy-of select="/data/weather/node()" /></p>
            </body>
          </html>
        </xsl:template>

        </xsl:stylesheet>

[]{#result_doc} [![My::WeatherTaglib's position in the weather1.xsp
processing
pipeline](/images/_pub_2002_04_16_axkit/weather1_flow_result_doc.png)](#weather1_flow.png){#weather1_flow_result_doc.png}
To generate the final HTML:

        <html>
        <head>
        <meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="Content-Type">
        <title>My weather report</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1><a name="title"/>My weather report</h1>
        <p>Hi! It's 17:05:08</p>
        <p>The weather in
            Pittsburgh,
            PA is
            Sunny and
            76F
            (courtesy of <a href="http://www.weather.com/search/search?where=15206">The
            Weather Channel</a>).
        </p>
        </body>
        </html>

Using the `/data/title` from the data document in two places in the
result document is a minor example of the benefit of separating the
original data generation from the final presentation. In the `<title>`
element, we're using `xsl:value-of`, which returns just the textual
content; in the `<h1>` element, we're using `xsl:copy-of`, which copies
the tags and the text. This allows the title to contain markup that we
strip in one place and use in another.

This is similar to the situation often found in real applications where
things like menus, buttons, location tell-tales ("Home &gt;&gt; Articles
&gt;&gt; Foo" and the like) and links to related pages often occur in
multiple places. Widgets like these make ideal "chunks" that the layout
page can place as needed.

This is only one example of a "final rendering" stage; different filters
could be used instead to deliver different formats. For instance, we
could use XSLT to deliver XML, XHTML, and/or plain text versions, or we
could use an AxKit-specific processor, XPathScript, to convert to things
like RTF, nroff, and miscellaneous documentation formats that XML would
otherwise have a hard time delivering.

[]{#real_world}

#### Relating `weather1.xsp` to the real world

If you squint a little at the code in My::WeatherTaglib, then you can
imagine using a
[DBI](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/DBI/DBI.html) query instead
of having Geo::Weather query a remote Web site (Geo::Weather is used
instead of DBI in this article to keep the example code and tarball
relatively simple).

Writing queries and other business logic in to taglibs has several major
advantages:

-   the XML taglib API puts a designer friendly face on the queries,
    allowing the XSP page to be tweaked or maintained by non-Perl
    literate folks with their preferred tools, hopefully getting you off
    the "please tweak the query parms" critical path.
-   Since the taglib API is XML, standard XML editors will catch basic
    syntax errors without needing to call in the taglib maintainer.
-   Schema validators and XSLT tools can also be used to allow the
    designers to check the higher-level syntax before pestering the
    taglib maintainer.
-   The query parameters and output can be touched up with Perl, making
    the "high level" XML interface simpler and more idiot-proof.
-   The output is XML, so other XML processors can be used to enhance
    the content and style. This allows, for instance, XSLT literate
    designers to work on the presentation without needing to learn or
    even see (and possibly corrupt) any Perl code or a new language (as
    is required with most HTML templating solutions).
-   It's quite difficult to accidently generate malformed XML using XSP:
    a well-formed XSP usually generates well-formed output.
-   The queries are decoupled from the source XML, so they can be
    maintained without touching the XSP pages.
-   The taglibs can be unit tested, unlike embedded code.
-   Taglibs can be wrappers around existing modules, so the same Perl
    code can be shared by both the web front end and any other scripts
    or tools that need them.
-   The plug-in nature of taglibs allows using many public and private
    XSP taglibs facilities for rapid prototyping. CPAN's [chock full of
    'em](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=XSP%3A%3A).
-   In addition to the "function" tags like the two demostrated above,
    you can program "conditional" tags that control whether or not a
    block of the XSP page is included; this gives you the ability to
    respond to user preferences or rights, for instance.

The [DBI](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/DBI/DBI.html) module
lets you work with almost any database ranging from [comma separated
value](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/DBD-CSV/DBD/CSV.html)
files (with SQL JOIN support no less) through MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
etc, etc., and returns Perl data structures just crying out to be
returned from a taglib function and turned in to XML.

For quick one-off pages and prototypes, the
[ESQL](http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/AxKit-XSP-ESQL/ESQL.html)
taglib allows you to embed SQL directly in XSP pages. This is not
recommended practice because it's not efficient enough for heavily
trafficed sites (the database connection is rebuilt each time), and
because mixing programming code in with the XML leads to some pretty
unreadable and hard-to-maintain pages, but it is good for one-off pages
and prototypes.

#### Help and thanks

In case of trouble, have a look at some of the [helpful resources we
listed last time](/pub/a/2002/03/12/axkit.html?page=3#help).

Thanks to Kip Hampton, Jeremy Mates and Martin Oldfield, for their
thorough reviews, though I'm sure I managed to sneak some bugs by them.
AxKit and many of the Perl modules it uses are primarily written by Matt
Sergeant with extensive contributions from these good folks and others,
so many thanks to all contributors as well.
