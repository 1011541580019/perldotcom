Please send corrections and additions to
perl-thisweek-YYYYMM@simon-cozens.org where YYYYMM is the current year
and month. Changes and additions to the perl5-porters biographies are
particularly welcome.

### [chromatic]{#chromatic}

P5P is in awe of the patience and test writing ability of chromatic, who
has, in a very short time, given us exhaustive new tests for `B::Terse`,
`Dumpvalue`, `CGI::Fast`, `CGI::Push`, `CPAN::Nox`, `Term::Cap`,
`Tie::Scalar`, `Term::Complete`, `ExtUtils::Command`, `less`, `open`,
`filetest`, `sigtrap`, `warnings::register`, and a bunch of patches to
older tests. Thank you!

### [Call for PerlIO bugs]{#Call_for_PerlIO_bugs}

Nicholas Clark found some people at a London.pm meeting who knew of
unfixed PerlIO bugs, and suggested the following call-for-bugs:

> If you are aware of a PerlIO bug that perl5-porters isn't aware of,
> please would you tell perl5-porters about it, preferably in the form
> of a regression test that will print "ok\\n" once it is fixed. Else
> don't be surprised if 5.8.0 ships with the bug still present.

(While you're at it, report any other lurking bugs you know about.)

### [Attributes are broken]{#Attributes_are_broken}

Arthur Bergman explained again why [attributes are
broken](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00051.html).
The problem is that the `MODIFY_*_ATTRIBUTE` subs (used to set
attributes for a variable) are called at compile time. Thus, in the
following code:

        sub MODIFY_SCALAR_ATTRIBUTE {
            ...
            tie $obj, $class;
        }

        for (1..10) {
            my $foo : bar = "BAZ";

            ...
        }

The variable `$foo` would be tied only on the first iteration of the
loop, after which the scope cleanup mechanism would remove its magic,
and the variable would remain untied for the remaining iterations.

### [Multiple FETCHes]{#Multiple_FETCHes}

Jeff 'japhy' Pinyan attacked some instances of `FETCH` being called
multiple times on tied variables (for `$tied++`, `$tied || $untied`),
thus causing potentially undesirable side-effects (Read an [analysis of
the
problem](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00070.html)
and [the proposed
solution](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00178.html)).
Several people pointed out the [problems with this
approach](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00190.html),
but no better solution has been found yet.

Jeff also wanted to optimise `grep` when called in boolean context (
`if (grep EXPR, LIST)`) to avoid iterating over the entire LIST, and
just return the first time `EXPR` was true, but the [potentially
desirable
side-effects](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00129.html)
of `EXPR` make this optimisation infeasible.

### [Code cleanups]{#Code_cleanups}

Casey West embarked on a `pod/*` cleanup, to make the example code use
strict where appropriate, be generally pleasing to the eye, and easy to
understand. Despite this noble goal, his patches were met with some
suspicion.

Jeff Pinyan said the example shouldn't use `$a`, the `sort` variable,
but Jarkko didn't want to encourage cargo-cult programming by punishing
the poor innocent `$a` for the vagaries of `sort`. Abigail didn't think
the patches accomplished anything useful, but Jarkko said that
consistency and following our own suggestions (in `perlstyle`) are
obviously good things.

Casey posted an explanation:

> I feel that my style is a generally acceptable one that everyone can
> understand. In that light, I don't think it's a bad thing if I make
> some minor changes (single versus double quotes) in the process of
> making a whole document better.

Nobody said anything after that.

### [Various]{#Various}

Andy Dougherty suggested an optional `make torture_test` target to run
tests which were not portable. (Schwern hasn't noticed yet.)

Arthur Bergman is running the LXR cross referencing tools on the perl
source. The result: PXR, the [Perl Cross
Reference](http://pxr.perl.org/source/). It will eventually contain
cross references of perl-current, the latest stable release, and the
Parrot source.

Brian Ingerson (of Inline fame) posted his first P5P patch, implementing
the oft-requested `Data::Dumper` feature to allow hash keys to be
sorted. He even got the indentation right the first time!

Craig Berry provided a patch to fix `%ENV` tainting on VMS. (Only five
tests fail on VMS now, and a couple of them are bogus failures.)

Jarkko released two snapshots: 12307 and 12340. (The latest snapshot can
be retrieved via rsync from "ftp.funet.fi::perlsnap".)

Michael Schwern sought a philosophical solution to the finding the path
to the running perl interpreter. Instead, he found that the contents of
`$^X` are system dependent when perl is invoked by a \#!-line.

Nicholas Clark continued to submit lots of little patches, one of which
became change \#12345. This is entirely fitting, because Nick is a hoopy
frood who knows exactly where his towel is.

Paul Marquess and Robin Barker are investigating a [DB\_File
bug](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00104.html)
involving filtered keys.

Stas Bekman is hunting down interesting
[MakeMaker](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00257.html)
(and
[related](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00352.html))
bugs. He also found a [scoping problem in the warnings
pragma](http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-10/msg00209.html).

Finally, P5P was specially selected to receive a free mini-vacation to
any of fifteen exciting destinations, along with several other people
whose email addresses contained "per."
