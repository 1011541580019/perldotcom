All\~

The observant among you might notice that I missed last week's summary.
With the hubbub and confusion of the holidays, I blame ninjas, in
particular Ryu Hyabusa. Given that Christmas is next weekend and New
Years is the weekend after that, what you are like to see in the future
are a pair of ten-day summaries or some other equally irregular pattern.
If you are thinking of using the dates of my summaries to seed a random
number generator, I would advise against it as I can be really easily
bought ;-). Without more ado, I give you this fortnight's summary
starting with:

### Perl 6 Language

#### [Lexical Scope of Parametric Declaration Blocks](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a93c3142b1e5d4d0/00f8f30b2072ddd0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#00f8f30b2072ddd0)

Ashley Winters wanted to know the differences between type parameter
lists and sub parameter lists. Luke Palmer could not think of any.

#### [Object Representation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9cb275722aa327b3/263c711b28d1c416?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#263c711b28d1c416)

Abhijit Mahabal noticed that S12 allowed one to supply an object layout
to ` bless()` and wondered if one could really have two instances of the
same class with different layouts. Larry admitted that he had probably
not intended for that to be the case.

#### [Capturing into a Hash, Hypothetically](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9516165d4ac18d9f/311a1cfb4d81a5e0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#311a1cfb4d81a5e0)

Patrick R. Michaud wondered about capturing things into a hash in S05,
as `<ident>` now captures. Larry admitted that it was probably supposed
to be `(<<ident>>)` but also noticed that this exposed a blind spot in
the design. He ruminated about this blind spot and ways to solve it.
After much churning, he decided that it would be possible to perform
multiple different (but identically named) rule captures by adding
information after a dash a la `<ws-1> <ws-2> <ws-3>`.

#### [Custom Subscripting](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0a68ecc0a9b5813b/7ff38e73da762a8d?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#7ff38e73da762a8d)

When talking about key Type for a hash, Larry offhandedly commented
about attaching a block to a hash or array to provided custom
subscripting. Many people drooled over the awesome syntactic sugar this
could provide them.

#### [Undeclared Attributes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/faa9911197e3fe6d/778ad6a110772849?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#778ad6a110772849)

Dave Whipp hoped that he need not predeclare his attributes; as they
necessarily start with ` $. ` The fact that a new variable is an
attribute is easy to determine. Abhijit Mahabal thought that it would
not be a good idea but then asked if classes could be declared as not
strict. We're still waiting for more official word...

#### [Classes Which Autovivify Attributes](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/45b5fce6d7d18e88/ff71ab8ff22ed0c4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#ff71ab8ff22ed0c4)

Abhijit Mahabal wondered about creating a class that populates its
attributes on demand, as some of them might be rarely used. Larry
suggested that it would be something that one should not undertake
lightly, and a simple hash attribute would provide most of what he
wanted. This also morphed into the eternal debate about strictures and
oneliners. There has to be a joke in there somewhere. A stricture, a
oneliner, and Larry Wall walk into a bar....

#### [Auto `my`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/95a14742f1904bc6/e85fa6de2d11f06a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e85fa6de2d11f06a)

Rod Adams wondered if having `my` occur automatically for new variables
might be worthwhile. Several people commented that some languages
already do this, and it is simply an aesthetic choice. The consensus
seems to be that Perl has already made this choice and will stick with
its answer.

### Perl 6 Compiler

At long last, Google has picked up P6C. I guess I have slightly mixed
emotions about this, as it takes a running gag from me. Alas, I will
have to find another.

#### PGE Tests

Markus Laire began working on a formerly small script to convert Perl
5's regex tests to PGE. He produced a modest 700 tests, a few of which
pass. Nice work. Patrick suggested only running the script once and
thereafter maintaining the tests external to Perl 5.

-   [Initial
    post](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/d18f4d37358ced6a/808f24640b57dea5?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#808f24640b57dea5)

-   [How to deal with abiguity
    converting](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/c71ba440a427f1ec/d6bff60bb550bb5c?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d6bff60bb550bb5c)

#### [On your marks, get set, HACK!](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.compiler/browse_frm/thread/af402d8eaa2595f5/9eb81f98e5378ec9?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.compiler%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#9eb81f98e5378ec9)

Luke Palmer opened the door to hacking and has requested rules for parts
of the Perl 6 Grammar. Patrick posted a link to [its SVN
repository](https://svn.perl.org/perl6).

### Parrot

#### ["\\0namespace"](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/43c5b9c73e4848db/217436af13c0c9fc?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#217436af13c0c9fc)

Leo committed a fix to support namespace mangling.

#### [Store Global =&gt; Invalidate Method Cache](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5c5e46756cd4f05d/c1f10ac184af35a4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#c1f10ac184af35a4)

Leo committed a fix to invalidate the method cache when storing a
global.

#### [`pow`, `hash`, Batman Sound Effects!](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/70b44974c2860073/d03c349941977f0a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d03c349941977f0a)

Leo added `pow` and `hash` as vtables and opcodes. He also renamed
`new_extended` to `instantiate`.

#### [Base Scalar Semantics](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c15476e3c9ca138b/58854737da2e4401?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#58854737da2e4401)

Leo asked for comments about base PMC semantics and received none.

#### [`split` Now Independent of Perl](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/46c2a1cf65c48c58/e1ec9e4ea1117694?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e1ec9e4ea1117694)

James deBoer provided a patch removing the dependency on `PerlArray` in
`split`. Will applied it.

#### [SVN](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a915411ce0206fd0/82349b8a0e5db102?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#82349b8a0e5db102)

Periodically, every project has a thread about switching some basic tool
to another basic tool. This time, the thread is in P6I, and the tools in
questions are CVS and SVN. Many voiced support, but no one decided
anything with any permanence.

#### [Continuations](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/214157bf29879710/9c8d3ba8639d45bd?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#9c8d3ba8639d45bd)

At long last, the long-running continuation thread has died down. Unless
I am mistaken, the status quo remains, and return continuations should
restore register contents even when promoted and repeatedly invoked.

#### [Correctly Dispatching Opcodes and Functions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/824cae85acf178d8/ec3f0af4b6a154b1?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#ec3f0af4b6a154b1)

Sam Ruby had some concern about dynamically overloading `__add__` in
Python. Leo and Sam had quite a bit of back and forth about the proper
way to handle it. I am not sure what resolution they reached other than
that it should work.

#### [Dynamic libs and Tcl Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d96a195d3dd44766/c595678463d6d0f1?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#c595678463d6d0f1)

Klaas-Jan Stol had some problems with Tcl and dynamic libs. Sam Ruby
provided the necessary fix for him.

#### [Class Refactoring](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/250ece92585432cd/d19c4b68f91fe9e6?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d19c4b68f91fe9e6)

Leo began refactoring base PMCs such as Integer. He also started a TODO
of what remains. This somehow morphed into discussion of logical
`xor`...

#### [Register Coloring Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/10979f287b2fa6cb/35717d665efc53de?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#35717d665efc53de)

Dan posted a failing test case for the register coloring. Leo fixed it.

#### [`split` on String vs Regex](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1f158c4366c62885/fd4e276e287c7e4c?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#fd4e276e287c7e4c)

James deBoer wondered about the `split` opcode's current insistence on a
string. Some advocated making it a method on a class, while others
wanted to change the opcode to take a PMC instead of a string.

#### [`self` vs P2](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e5cee4871a9e1fc7/8581b2b9f395c419?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#8581b2b9f395c419)

Sam Ruby discovered that usages of P2 had broken, as it was no longer
the object of a method. Fortunately, Leo provided the helpful `self`.

#### [Linux PPC](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3cf8e317d26e3bcf/7a6ddc2d2cf14b33?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#7a6ddc2d2cf14b33)

Long ago, there were troubles with Linux on PPC. Recently, chromatic
submitted a patch. More recently, Warnock applied.

#### [Whether vs Weather](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/373ac21fc9db4bfe/3859a503c0a5de90?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#3859a503c0a5de90)

This morning it was cold and snowy. Sadly, instead of fixing my dreary
weather, chromatic fixed a mistyped "whether."

#### [Benchmarks as Test](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9f09741447b66ebc/6ba693efa9e2b84c?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6ba693efa9e2b84c)

Justin DeVuyst supplied a patch to use the benchmarks as tests. Leo
applied it.

#### [`make [install|docs|monkeys]`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/dece7f5cabdd5ded/07b5495abd2ea138?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D30%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#07b5495abd2ea138)

Adrian Lambeck suggested a few improvements to the current make set up,
including a cool sounding `make doc-install`. Warnock applied.

#### [Dan Still Alive](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/daf976c64a96f368/bb340708ab6ae1f0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#bb340708ab6ae1f0)

Dan sent an apology about the egregious amount of work he had and
assured everyone that he was actively trying to get caught up. In the
mean time, Cc him on things that need his personal attention, like your
Christmas lists.

#### [IMCC Parser No Longer Chokes on Empty Sub](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/537ebd7fb3e715de/a80c6b7e0de25dac?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#a80c6b7e0de25dac)

Will noted that gremlins had fixed a problem in IMCC with empty subs.
Yay, gremlins!

#### [Current Object Invocation](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3982c73332ba5d65/90b236b18b324053?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#90b236b18b324053)

Dan discovered that Parrot put the current object into its place after
calling `invoke`. This was, of course, bad, so Leo fixed it.

#### [Configure Help](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/123a57c984ae3255/7df334dcb5f20e2d?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#7df334dcb5f20e2d)

Somebody had trouble with *Configure.pl*. Leo pointed out the usefulness
of `--verbose=2`.

#### [`./parrot nonexistant.pbc` =&gt; core dump](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/76056987830cd723/d8d8d2a561ccde3d?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d8d8d2a561ccde3d)

Dan noticed that Parrot would core dump when given a nonexistance
bytecode file. Matthew Zimmerman and chromatic fought to get a patch in
first. One succeeded.

#### [Python Dynclasses Build Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8e9693869a5eb19f/142c9526f7d82393?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#142c9526f7d82393)

Will noticed a multiple definition problem in the py\* dynclasses. Sam
fixed it.

#### [MMD Dispatch Problem](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/adae2ebb6eb3533d/d0016a8a5f0be7c4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d0016a8a5f0be7c4)

Jens Rieks reported a problem with `mmd_dispatch_v_pnp`. Leo could not
reproduce it.

#### [mod\_parrot with Mandelbrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0ec537181da1dc6b/d90b30500b8748a7?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#d90b30500b8748a7%0A)

Jeff Horwitz posted a link to a [webpage using mod\_parrot to generate
ASCII Mandelbrot sets](http://www.smashing.org/mod_parrot). Really cool,
but I prefer Julia sets.

#### Documentation Shortcomings

Dave Brondsema pointed out that the main FAQ should include info on the
IRC channels/hosts that Parroters use. He also noted that some PDDs were
not available on the website. Warnock applies.

-   [irc](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ee16a6a40951a989/b663216e7a62b099?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b663216e7a62b099)

#### [Scope Cleanup Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ae4a03fb5d3df295/616f25e5d43348ba?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#616f25e5d43348ba)

Leo and Dan hashed out some of the issues with scope clean up and stale
registers keeping things alive.

#### [WinXP Duild Issues](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7b3d26581e5a951d/db228ae4d47bf138?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#db228ae4d47bf138)

Nicu Ionita reported a problem with the build on WinXP. Leo fixed it.

#### [`runops_fromc`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/47689b780a1f7941/be5fa7f74b4d5d1a?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#be5fa7f74b4d5d1a)

Sam Ruby provided a patch allowing `runops_fromc` access to registers.
Leo applied it.

#### [Parameter Fillin Problem](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a19458c4fa570074/fbb6658956e0c04e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#fbb6658956e0c04e)

Dan posted about a problem he was having. Unforunately, he cannot make a
simple test case against CVS head, and Leo can't reproduce it.

#### [Class Autoload](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6843a04696561442/b2f2337c4f026861?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b2f2337c4f026861)

Leo added support for autoloading dynamic classes for Python and Tcl.
Sam Ruby suggested ways to extend it further.

#### [P5 Is the New P2](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/51e645c36023c77f/f8c37497aaded1e8?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#f8c37497aaded1e8)

Sam and Leo came to the conclusion that the current object should be
passed in P5 as well as P2. Currently, they are waiting for Dan...
nudge, nudge...

#### [`get_anonymous_subclass`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/eb26d8206c8346d4/8f6474c75a47ed78?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#8f6474c75a47ed78)

Leo wondered what `get_anonymous_subclass` was for. Dan explained.

#### [Context, Wrappers, Rules, NCI](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/765fa0191688b49f/e23c8a3bdaa7bdde?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#e23c8a3bdaa7bdde)

Sam and Leo had a discussion about what exactly VTABLE functions, MMD
functions, and ops should do. I think they spent much of the time

Bernhard Schmalhofer provided a patch cleaning up `Hash`. Sam wondered
if the NCI calls in `Hash::fromkeys` could go away along with a few
others. Leo said that iterators in general needed another round of
thought.

#### [Opcode/Sub Conflict](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/39f5a1d8f7a23d4e/aa2c0177c22b12f8?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#aa2c0177c22b12f8)

Leo suggested a mechanism for MMD and `VTABLE_find`. Sam Ruby provided
some input.

#### [Auxiliary Variables](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e169f5cdf871ab52/27b9495dafd24c36?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%2Fthreads%3Fstart%3D0%26order%3Drecent%26&_doneTitle=Back&&d#27b9495dafd24c36)

Tomas Necas wondered about the necessity of auxiliary variables in Perl
6. Luke Palmer and Dan provided some answers.
