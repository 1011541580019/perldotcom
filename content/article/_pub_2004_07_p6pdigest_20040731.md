As I threatened last week, I'm moving the rollover point for these
summaries from midnight on Sunday/Monday to midnight on Friday/Saturday,
but rather than do it in one swell foop, I'm doing a couple of six-day
weeks. The theory is that once I become a student teacher, I'll be
rather busy during the week, but I should still be able to make time to
write the summaries on the weekend.

That's the theory, at least; you'll note that this didn't get posted to
the mailing lists on a Sunday. Blame my cousin for getting married. It
won't happen again.

#### [Pie-thon]{#Pie-thon}

Good news! Guido is a gentleman and declined to throw a pie at Dan.

Bad news! The Perl community is a bunch of savages, and they paid \$520
to be able to throw pie at Dan.

Good news! There are photos.

#### [Notes to Self]{#Notes_to_self}

1.  American's pronounce "maths" as "math."
2.  Don't make silly cracks about American rectitude.
3.  Oops.

#### [Leo's Proposed Calling Conventions]{#Leo's_proposed_calling_conventions}

It's been apparent for a while now that Leo TÃ¶tsch isn't happy with
Parrot's current calling conventions. This week, he posted a
proof-of-concept patch implementing a proposed new scheme. Luke Palmer
agreed that it was probably worth consideration. We'll see what Dan has
to say when he gets back from OSCON.

#### [Stack-Based Language]{#Stack_based_language}

RaghavendraK asked about the difference between stack- and register-
based virtual machines. Brent Royal-Gordon gave good advice.

#### [ICU Outdated]{#ICU_outdated}

Joshua Gatcomb noted that the ICU that comes with Parrot is, not to put
too fine a point on it, old and buggy. The ICU developers have suggested
that Parrot move to version 3.0. Josh proposed various ways of doing
this. Leo wants ICU out of the Parrot CVS, but Dan's argued in the past
that it should be in there because he doesn't want to force people to
chase around fetching a raft of required libraries before they can build
Parrot.

#### [Jarkko Proposed for CVS Check-In Rights]{#Jarkko_proposed_for_a_CVS_checkin_rights}

Following a raft of high-quality patches from Jarkko Hietaniemi, Leo
proposed him for membership of the `cvs ci` club.

### [Meanwhile, in perl6-language]{#Meanwhile,_in_perl6-language}

#### [What's Core?]{#What's_core?}

Larry and Dan Hursh discussed what would be going into the standard Perl
6 distribution. Dan argued that we should be concentrating on producing
a distribution akin to the current Perl 5 distribution, but with a few
fewer kitchen sinks. Larry argued that we should concentrate on two
distributions:

1.  **Bare bones**: just able to build itself and with enough capability
    to bootstrap everything else.
2.  **Extended**: The barebones system plus a set of libraries fetchable
    from CP6AN that constitute the Perl 6 "supported" library; modules
    that are maintained by the Perl 6 equivalent of perl5-porters, and
    which will be supported over a long timeframe.

I don't think Dan's been convinced yet. Elsewhere in the thread, Luke
Palmer coined the delightful acronym EYEWTIBWATA -- Everything You Ever
Wanted To Install But Were Afraid To Ask -- or "eye-witty-bwattle." I'm
unsure about whether it's going to rank up there with "tim-toe-tidy,"
though.

### [Announcements, Apologies, Acknowledgements]{#Announcements,_Apologies,_Acknowledgements}

I'm getting bored of typing "Palmer" and "TÃ¶tsch" once a week, so I'm
considering treating Luke and Leo like Larry, Dan, Damian, and, if you
insist, chromatic.
