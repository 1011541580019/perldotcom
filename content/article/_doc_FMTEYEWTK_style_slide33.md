-   Data structures are more important than code.
-   Rob Pike says: \`Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. (See Brooks p. 102.)'
-   Capture regularity with data, irregularity with code. (Kernighan)
-   If you see similar functionality in two places, unify it. That is called a \`subroutine'.
-   Consider making a hash of function pointers to represent a state table or switch statement.
