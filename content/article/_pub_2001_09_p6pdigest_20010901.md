The Perl 6 lists saw a little more traffic during this week: 137
messages across 19 threads, with 40 authors contributing.

### [Expunge Implicit `@_` Passing]{#Expunge_Implicit___Passing}

(22 posts) This topic from [two weeks
ago](/pub/a/2001/08/p6pdigest/20010818.html#Perl_6_Language) came up
again, as Ken Fox
[mentioned](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08070.html)
its use in redirectors. Michael Schwern suggested using `goto &code`
instead, and provided this final justification:

> Why not just \$method-&gt;(@\_); or &{\$method}(@\_); or goto
> \$method?
>
> Any time you want to implicitly pass @\_, you can just as easily
> \*explicitly\* pass it or use goto. As we're not doing pass-throughs
> all over the place, it's not the sort of thing you want implicit, as
> opposed to, say \$\_.

(This thread then
[devolved](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08082.html)
into a general debate on the usefulness of Java final classes.)

### [Finalization and Deterministic Destruction]{#Finalization_and_Deterministic_Destruction}

(11 posts) Hong Zhang, however, did [branch
off](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08089.html)
and talk about the differentiation between finalization and destruction.
There were then quite a few posts lamenting the demise of deterministic
destruction with the move away from ref counting towards a more complex
garbage collection scheme.

Dan Sugalski [pointed
out](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08106.html):

> GC has nothing to do with finalization. Many people want it to, and
> seem to conflate the two, but they're separate. Dead object detection
> and cleanup doesn't have to be tied to memory GC. It won't be in perl
> 6. The perl 6 engine will guarantee whatever cleanup/finalization
> order and timliness that Larry puts into the language definition.
> That's not a problem.

### [Multiple Dispatch on Objects]{#Multiple_Dispatch_on_Objects}

(11 posts) The first of two threads on multiple dispatch started
[here](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08110.html),
with two examples
[here](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08113.html)
and
[here](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08114.html).

There was talk about whether it was an OO technique, how it should work
with the dynamicness of Perl, and what the best, most efficient manner
of implementing multimethod dispatch is. In the end, Perl will support
some form of pluggable multimethod dispatcher, although that was about
all that was agreed upon.

(10 posts) The [second
thread](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08127.html)
decoupled multiple dispatch from objects, creating what it essentially
subroutine overloading (by signature).

### [Program Metadata]{#Program_Metadata}

(15 posts) I
[mentioned](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08129.html)
a few pieces of metadata that I would like access to from within a Perl
6 program. The bulk of the thread was about how to
[access](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08132.html)
the source of a script from within a script in Perl 5.

### [`!<` versus `>=`]{#_versus_}

(7 posts) Raptor
[suggested](http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-language@perl.org/msg08151.html)
adding `!>` and `!<` to the logical operators as Another Way To Do It.
Reactions were mixed, but no technical reason was given why it couldn't
be. (It should be noted that in tri-state logic, where he saw this, `!<`
is not the same as `>=`.)

### [Parroty Bits]{#Parroty_Bits}

Simon Cozens and Dan Sugalski are finishing up the seed code for the
Parrot interpreter base.

Dan:

> The broad design of the Parrot internals is sufficiently complete to
> start implementing parts, and we are. We've the first cut core of an
> interpreter and, while I figure we'll probably rewrite the thing at
> least once before final release, it runs. You can now write code in
> Parrot assembler, assemble it, and run the results.
>
> Most of the defined opcodes don't have corresponding code for them, so
> it's limited at the moment to integer and float operations with some
> control flow (branch, jump, and if) but more will be on the way soon.

Simon:

> I've been sitting down and writing bits of Perl 6 (I'm working
> primarily on the string functions at the moment, because I can do that
> without getting in Dan's hair too much) and also collecting our
> thoughts on the interpreter into documents that will specify the API
> and as much of the Grand Design as people need to know to be able to
> start helping.

The next phase of Parrot will be a code review - for the Perl internals
community to poke and prod and make sense of what Dan and Simon have
done. The community will provide feedback, and Dan and Simon will
disappear for a brief period, before the code is opened up for
development.

After going public, work will mostly progress according to Dan's To Do
list.

### [Last Words]{#Last_Words}

The last I heard, the next pair of stone tablets from Larry Wall and
Damian Conway are coming down the mountain. That's my story, and I'm
sticking to it.
