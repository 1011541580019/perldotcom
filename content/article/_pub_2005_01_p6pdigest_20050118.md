Welcome to yet another Perl Summary brought to you by music and pizza
(although the pizza is late in arriving). Like many summaries before it,
we start with an attempt at non sequitur and Perl 6 Language.

### Perl 6 Language

#### [Idiomatic Perl 6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b3eee67e168e307c/1e865f9b0b1b2eec?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1e865f9b0b1b2eec)

StÃ©phane Payrard expressed a desire for more Perl 6 sample code. Luke
Palmer issued the following, possibly foolish, response: "Post some 'how
do I's...?' to the list, and I'll reply with code." Austin Hastings
posed a couple, but there's no response yet ...

#### [Generalized Tainting](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/7399190967f8b425/3ab0fa30a7a3c812?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#3ab0fa30a7a3c812)

Yuval Kogman posted an interesting musing about contagious properties
(if you pull a value from someone with a contagious property, the
property comes along, too). There were no responses, but it sounds
interesting.

#### [`Stick`/`Pick`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b60b94553109d196/c23ee29694e0cdf9?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#c23ee29694e0cdf9)

Richard H. suggested a new pair of functions, `stick`/`pick`, which
would have modifiers such that `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, and
`splice` could all be calls to stick or pick with appropriate modifiers.
Unfortunately, I think he posted it to the Google Groups interface, as
it is there but not on the list. :-(

#### [Perl 6 IDE, Again](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d31481c114e88a11/6fee65a60d6e190b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6fee65a60d6e190b)

Matisse Enzer re-raised the question of the feasibility of an IDE for
Perl 6. Unfortunately, I think he re-raised it on Google Groups.

#### [1x6 vs. 6](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/96503cca52fd9c56/b335e917f3c0db0e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b335e917f3c0db0e)

The dimension slice issues continue to grind with new suggestions from
David Green and Craig DeForest.

#### [Lifespan of Loop Counters](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a2ddf112aa0bbf40/82e94fb1cfb404aa?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#82e94fb1cfb404aa)

Joe Gottman wants an easy way to restrict the lifespan of his loop
counter to his loop. Some folks (myself included) did not like the
answer of wrapping it in a scope. Others (myself excluded) thought the
answer "don't use `loop`, use `for`" was a bit of a cop-out.

#### [`Forany` & `Forall`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c0aac33183670ccb/afb1c80562a9bf40?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.language%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#afb1c80562a9bf40)

Jonathan Lang wondered how to check if a condition is true for any
element of an array or for all elements. The answer is to use the aptly
named junction creators of `any()` and `all()`.

### Perl 6 Compiler

I've already reached p6c with no pizza. :-( Ah well, it was a light
week.

### Parrot Internals

I've already reached p6i and still no pizza :-(. Although it was close,
after I wrote the `=head2` my door buzzed. It was just a locked-out
neighbor, but that would have been impressive timing.

#### [*Blib* in 25 Seconds](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/13efa03d11995889/fc4726ffd175662b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#fc4726ffd175662b)

Peter Christopher asked for a 25-second summary of the *./blib*
directory. Apparently this is harder than Hamlet in 30 seconds, which
already exists.

#### [Searching Archives](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/144b250f3845ed3b/10ac67a3f6383aab?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#10ac67a3f6383aab)

Peter Christopher wanted to know if there was a way he could search the
mailing list archives. Steve Fink pointed him to groups.google.com and
the ever-popular discussion topic "aardvarks."

#### Dynclasses with External Dependencies

Bernhard Schmalhofer wondered if there was a reasonable way to check for
external dependencies for dynamic PMCs that does not involve the core
Parrot configure step. Later he supplied a patch with his GDBMHash pmc,
which motivated the question. Leo applied it and hinted at a mythical
multi-stage configure.

-   [Question](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a51cc847fc6a56b9/371bf70adf0569b0?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#371bf70adf0569b0)
-   [Patch](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8144e9c83f34afdc/6111cee72a601a2f?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6111cee72a601a2f)

#### [`s/Interpreter/INTERP/g`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/076bed21ea8c5005/32c2920294524874?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#32c2920294524874)

Bernhard Schmalhofer provided a patch, making the above cleanup all
over. Leo and Sam applied different parts of it.

#### Black-ops Parrot

Robert Spier posted a link to the new listing for Parrot on CIA.
Nicholas Clark dove for cover.

-   [CIA](http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/parrot)
-   [Actual
    Post](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2ccc347e62a108d8/a4609593914578b5?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#a4609593914578b5)

#### [PDD Problems on the Website](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a53a24f2aa5cc202/54165e5ddf4f5f8e?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#54165e5ddf4f5f8e)

Dave Brondsema noticed that PDDs 4-6 had not found their way to the
website properly. Will Coleda fired off a patch.

#### Cleaning Old Tickets

Will Coleda, in his never-ending role as RT janitor, closed out a few
obsolete tickets. Thanks, Will.

-   [Stone-Age
    Exceptions](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/93a08abe9dbb38aa/a2b066dbaec2a29f?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#a2b066dbaec2a29f)
-   [*Assemble.pl*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3b78d24f9207e120/57ddd23c5b19320b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#57ddd23c5b19320b)
-   [*Languages/imcc*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e75ed93673aaaace/576298f84bd61718?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#576298f84bd61718)

#### [Scope and Timely Destruction](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7acc217ddcbc84a8/6fa389d176b99b64?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#6fa389d176b99b64)

Leopold Toetsch raised the recurring issue of timely destruction. It
turns out that timely destruction is hard. Various people made various
suggestions. Let me state one thing clearly as if I don't, Dan doubtless
will: Parrot will *not* use reference counting of any kind. There are a
great many reasons for this some of which Luke Palmer explained.

#### [`ParrotIO*` Should Have Been `PMC*`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/62850c0d067ceb93/7ce1a32b0217b55b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#7ce1a32b0217b55b)

Peter Christopher provided a patch fixing a pointer declaration bug. Leo
applied it.

#### [Questions for the Compiler FAQ](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/10083334ec147124/448ef8053c7f0ab4?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#448ef8053c7f0ab4)

Some time ago, a compiler FAQ started to contain answers to questions
that people posted to the list. Will Coleda posted two such questions,
but there has been no response.

#### [*Languages/Perl6*](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1187c8a987294a13/7cc29b214379aff8?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#7cc29b214379aff8)

Will Coleda wondered what would come of the *languages/perl6* stuff as
PGE now has its own SVN repository. No one answered.

#### [Parakeet with Broken Wings](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8b091009f3fc224d/1b000bb26d5cf99b?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#1b000bb26d5cf99b)

Will added an RT ticket for Parakeet, which broke in a recent shuffle.

#### [Crashing Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/19b427ae3dc4e52a/b65ff846197a2e15?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#b65ff846197a2e15)

Will found out that he could crash Parrot by doing stuff with GCed
memory. Leo admitted that he could.

#### Collecting Academic Garbage

Shevek asked for a good place to read about garbage collection
techniques. Garrett Goebel pointed him to just such a page.

-   [The
    Past](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/14246a9c228bd313/9f04c1d0203f09ae?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#9f04c1d0203f09ae)
-   [The Page](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/rej/gc.html)

#### [`Argv[0]`](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5ac3f1c5375d5da5/63c479a0364480d9?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#63c479a0364480d9)

Will wants to fetch the moral equivalent of `argv[0]`.

#### [Proposed VTABLE Changes for Method Lookup](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2a32fa21e2795b7f/fd10f5769fb8ed39?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#fd10f5769fb8ed39)

Leo suggested a VTABLE change to facilitate MMD and method lookup. The
thread had several suggestions and questions.

#### [Food](http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/04/fowles)

Matt Fowles's pizza arrived. The reader then speculated that either (he
writes slowly or it arrived quickly) or (he writes quickly or it arrived
slowly), depending on various readers' estimates of pizza-delivery time
and expected word-per-minute summarization.

#### [Bring Hither the Fatted Parrot](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c3549ba4ffce05e7/53f3f63c523ff824?_done=%2Fgroup%2Fperl.perl6.internals%3F&_doneTitle=Back+to+topics&_doneTitle=Back&&d#53f3f63c523ff824)

Dan has returned to us. Hopefully he will be able to advance the quest
for meta-objects and interoperability.
