### [Testing, testing]{#Testing_testing}

The focus this week has very definitely been on testing, with the great
Michael Schwern providing all sorts of QA advice, tests and patches. He
patched: `t/op/rand.t`, `t/op/time.t`, `t/op/srand.t`, `t/op/local.t`,
`t/op/concat.t`, `t/op/misc.t`, `t/run/segfault.t`, `pod/perlhack.pod`,
`t/op/pack.t`, `lib/Cwd.pm`, `lib/File/Find.pm`, and
`lib/File/Find/taint.t`, in an earnest attempt to deprive himself of
\$500.

He also wrote a [CPAN.pm testing
module](http://www.pobox.com/~schwern/src/CPAN-Smoke-0.02.tar.gz), and
passed on tests from Andrew Wilson (thanks, Andrew!) for `CGI::Switch`,
`CGI::Apache` and `CGI::Cookie`.

Uhm. Wow.

Jonathan Stowe wrote a test suite for `Shell.pm` (Yes, honest) and
Rafael Garcia-Suarez, who seems to have taken responsibility for the
coderef-in- `@INC` feature, wrote some tests for that. Rafael also wins
the prize for the funniest JAPH I've seen in a long time, but I'm going
to make you hunt through the archives to find that. :)

### [Coderef-in-@INC]{#Coderef_in_INC}

Rafael also sought to make the information in `%INC` useful for modules
loaded via the coderef-in- `@INC`. Now, for instance, you could see
entries in `%INC` such as

         /loader/0x81095c8/Foo.pm - CODE(0x81095c8)

The address in the "loader" section matches the address of the coderef.

Artur complained that the tests would only work on PerlIO, and could be
rewritten to be more general; Rafael knew about this and tried to find a
cleaner solution.

Gisle, on the other hand, was more concerned about the nature of what
was going in `%INC`:

> What is still missing is to make sure `pp_require()` invokes the hook
> again when an absolute filename starting with things like
> `"/loader/0x81095c8/"` is used. Currently this bypass the `@INC`
> search which is quite likely to make the require fail.
>
> If you for instance try to serve up the Tk modules via a hook like
> this you will discover that it has a special AUTOLOAD function that
> construct absolute file names based on the `%INC` value. It will then
> load its .al files like this:
>
>         require '/loader/0x81095c8/auto/Tk/Frame/scrollbars.al';

Rafael said that `AutoLoader` falls back to a relative path if it has
problems, and also discussed the possibility of having `DynaLoader`
serve up binaries via a `@INC` hook. (Blugh.)

Nick Clark, who's one of the evil minds behind this whole thing, wanted
something less plausible than `/loader/whatever` which could conceivably
be a path if someone's really out to get us, and so Rafael
counter-proposed `&(0x...)`. Nick also expressed suitable disgust at the
getting-binaries-from-a-coderef idea.

### [Default random seed]{#Default_random_seed}

Michael Schwern (Yes, him again) noticed that in certain circumstances,
calling `srand` twice with no argument can produce the same set of
random numbers. He asked for more pseudo-random data that we can use to
perturb the seed of `srand` on machines that don't have `/dev/urandom`.
Merijn suggested `times`, but Jarkko said that the usual granularity for
that was only a jiffy, which might not be enough. Jarkko and Mike Guy
both pointed out that running `srand` twice was generally speaking a
Don't Do That, Then error. Mike Guy's comments on `srand` bear
repeating:

> You shouldn't ever use srand() (i.e. without argument) more than once
> in a script. The internal state of the RNG should contain more entropy
> than can be provided by any seed, so calling srand() again actually
> \*loses\* randomness. And you shouldn't use srand() at all unless you
> need backward compatibility with \*very\* old Perls.
>
> Of course, srand(\$x) with an explicit argument is a quite different
> kettle of fish. But you should only be doing that if you know what you
> are doing ...

Jarkko pointed out that

        srand(31337);
        @first_run  = mk_rand;

        srand(1138);
        @second_run = mk_rand;

might fail if we have really, really, really bad luck. But with 100
numbers in each array, it would have to be cosmically significantly bad
luck. And Mike Guy pointed out that if we do get the same sequence back,
then our `rand` isn't sufficiently random and this could be considered a
bug.

### [local chdir()]{#local_chdir}

Michael Schwern (Yes, him again) expressed his deep-seated longing for

        local chdir($foo);

which changed directory back once the scope is over. Kurt Starsinic said
that we wouldn't always be able to go back, and so you might as well
`fork` if that's what you want. (Amazingly, Artur didn't suggest using
threads.) Jeremy Zawodny got really excited by the idea, and suggested
being able to `local` an entire block of code and have the effects
rolled back at the end of the scope. Yeah, right. However, he did
suggest writing a little `pushdir/popdir` module, which was a little
more sensible than hacking core for fun and profit. Schwern wrote
something using Abigail's `DESTROY` trick, and Abigail showed a nicer
variant by using a tied scalar which changed directory when you assigned
to it.

Abhijit Menon-Sen got in a particularly silly mood and actually
implemented `local chdir($foo)` (with a bit of help from you're truly,
who's always in a particularly silly mood) which caused Schwern to ask
for more, more, more... `select`, `umask`, `chmod` and so on were now on
the table. Sarathy expressed some dismay at the waste of precious
`op_private` bits, as well as the "semantic complexity" of the idea
itself. Abhijit himself summed up the opinions of several of us:

> I'm not convinced that we should allow localizing actions (as opposed
> to values), and adding destructors piecemeal for random ops would make
> me very uncomfortable.
>
> That said, I wouldn't object to a module which -- with suitable hooks
> in the core -- allowed arbitrary leave\_scope() actions to be
> registered. I might even write it sometime.

That'd be worth seeing.

### [File::Spec]{#FileSpec}

Michael Schwern - oh no, it was Chris Nandor - had a problem with
`File::Spec`:

> In Mac OS, you can tell it to be relative by making the first argument
> a leading empty string. So `catfile("a", "b")` is absolute, while
> `catfile("", "a", "b")` is relative. In Unix/Windows, it is exactly
> the opposite: the default is relative, but adding a leading empty
> string makes it absolute!

As Chris rightly pointed out, "Yikes!" If `File::Spec` is supposed to
make things more portable, we have a problem. Chris suggested making
relative paths the default and breaking MacPerl in the interests of
sanity. Barrie Slaymaker, who owns `File::Spec` said that he'd be
willing to accept patches if he thought the MacPerl community could cope
with the breakage. Peter Prymmer said that the required change on VMS
probably wouldn't break that much and he was more interested in making
the API cross-platform. Tim Jenness asked whether or not `catdir` ought
to support volumes, such as on DOS or VMS. Phillip Newton reminded us
that there is a difference between `A:b\c` and `A:\b\c`, and that he
expected `catdir('a:', 'b', 'c')` to do the former rather than the
latter. Yup, each drive has its own idea of the current working
directory.

Anyway, it looks like the consensus was that Chris's suggestion will be
adopted once Barrie gets Mac and VMS patches, `File::Spec` will be truly
portable again, and all the world will rejoice.

### [Smoking!]{#Smoking}

The daily build project is great! Quite a few interesting bug reports
have come out of the fact that we have Perl being tested almost
continuously now on different platforms and architectures with all
manner of different build options. I started smoke testing my desktop
this week and confirmed some bugs that other people were seeing on AIX
and FreeBSD, probably saving Merijn from a lot of unpleasant AIX and
pains. If you want to get involved and donate some of your processing
power, subscribe to the
[daily-build](mailto:daily-build-subscribe@cpan.org) mailing list.

Paul Marquess found a potential `DB_File` bug with the help of Merijn's
smoke results, and Artur got to track down a bizarre segfault in the
`File::Taint` tests. Will Coleda broke Cygwin, but Gerrit Hasse thinks
that was his own fault. Nick Clark found a bug in `MANIFEST` of all
places, but this was explained as being a bad time to resync.

### [Various]{#Various}

Ed Peschko asked why we don't have `$SIG{__EXIT__}` and was told by
various people to use an `END` block.

Paul Johnson produced the useful but perhaps dangerous `coretest` make
target, which only runs a subset of the testing suite, allowing you to
dash off your latest patch without completely testing you haven't broken
anything subtle. (I know, because I did it last week.)

Nicholas Clark silently went on making more and more of Perl able to
preserve `IV`s where possible. Nobody cared. He also found lots and lots
of interesting bugs.

Artur, pumpkinging madly, found a lovely bug in HP-UX which we can
probably blame on gcc: `inet_ntoa` always returns 0.0.0.0. This is
obviously not useful. He also found a bug in the tests of `Time::Hires`
where every so often the test fails due to rounding error between the
ordinary integer version of `time` and the floating-point hi-res
version.

Yusuf Goolamabbas asked whether something (lack of support for large
files) was a Perl problem or a RedHat packaging problem. Two people took
the opportunity to pass the buck. Amusingly, Chip Turner from RedHat
turned up to pass it back:

> I believe Large files are supported only with 2.4 kernels and certain
> glibcs. Which basically means for proper large file support, you will
> need Red Hat 7.1. Even then, some utilities don't work, Perl being
> one.

Ouch.

Daniel Lewart picked up a few miscellaneous bugs in `Time::Local`, and
Rafael fixed up the example of an array shuffle in `perlfaq4` to be less
confusing to the learner. (It used the same variable name for an array
and an array reference!)

Jarkko is now back, and rapidly catching up on his P5P backlog, so it's
time for me to go and generate some more for him, and until next week I
remain, your humble and obedient servant,
