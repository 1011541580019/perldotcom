The Perl Conference organizers are asking for your help! Do you have any pictures taken at past Perl conferences (North America) from 1999 through 2018? That’s right! Organizers are seeking photos spanning the last 20 years. This can be any conference photo from The Perl Foundation run events like Yet Another Perl Conference (YAPC) and The Perl Conference (TPC). The full list of qualifying events is on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yet_Another_Perl_Conference#North_America).

If you have a photo or photos that you’d like to share from previous YAPC::NA or TPC::NA events please send a link or full resolution file to admin@perlconference.us.
