A few months ago, as I was familiarizing myself with the old Perl.com source material, I kept getting distracted by these wonderful articles that I hadn't read before. Now that the site has relaunched, and the old articles lovingly restored, I thought I'd share a few of these hidden gems with you.

### Here be Wizards

*Where Wizards Fear to Tread* was a brief, perlguts-focused series started by Simon Cozens. This particular [article]({{< relref "legacy/_pub_2002_05_07_optree.md" >}}) discusses the Perl op tree.

For more recent Perl op tree content, Sawyer presented his work on [Ref::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Ref::Util) at YAPC:

<div class="centering">
<iframe  width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gv-DCM9I8v0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

His talk contains a good explanation of how custom ops work (enough to get you started on them). I'd love to rekindle this series. If you have a perlguts-type article that you'd like to write, please get in touch with [me](mailto:perl.com-editor@perl.org) or see our contributing [guide](https://github.com/dnmfarrell/perldotcom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and send us a pull request with a draft article.

### Language specific

In the old Perl.com source code, I came across several un-formatted articles which didn't appear to have been officially published on the site, but did contain good content. For example [Tom Christiansen's](https://www.perl.com/authors/tom-christiansen/) article [The Seven Deadly Sins of Perl](https://www.perl.com/doc/FMTEYEWTK/versus/perl.html/) is a fun read worthy of your time. Can you count how many of the "sins" have been addressed since then?

Speaking of Tom Christiansen, the Perl.com author [list](https://www.perl.com/authors/) lists contributors by the number of articles they've contributed in descending order. Tom is near the top because I've converted his [Perl Style](https://www.perl.com/doc/FMTEYEWTK/style/slide-index.html/) and [Perl Unicode Cookbook](https://www.perl.com/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-standard-preamble.html/) documents into collections, with each entry as a separate article. Both are useful resources.

### Thought provoking

Larry has a good number of [articles](https://www.perl.com/authors/larry-wall/) on Perl.com, including some of the oldest. The [2nd State of the Onion](https://www.perl.com/pub/1998/08/show/onion.html/) was published way back in August 1998, and it's still an entertaining read (or re-read if you've forgotten it).

Finally, [Why not Translate Perl to C?](https://www.perl.com/pub/2001/06/27/ctoperl.html/) is an intriguing article by [Mark Jason Dominus](https://www.perl.com/authors/mark-jason-dominus/). MJD regularly blogs at his own [site](https://blog.plover.com/).

### More to come

There are more articles to recommend, but for the sake of brevity I'll stop here. In the meantime feel free to explore the site; you never know, you might stumble upon another ... hidden gem!
