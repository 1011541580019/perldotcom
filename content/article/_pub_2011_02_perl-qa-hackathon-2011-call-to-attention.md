> The Perl QA hackathon 2011 is taking place from Saturday, April 16th to Monday, April 18th 2011 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Attendance is gratis. We would like to know if you are interested in coming and participating. You can also propose other people who should be invited. As with the hackathons in the past years, we aim to fund the travel and accommodation costs for those who cannot get funding otherwise.

> We would like to hear about your topics and ideas. Please find further information at the [Perl QA Hackathon 2011 Wiki](http://2011.qa-hackathon.org/qa2011/wiki).
