This is just a quick note to let you know that I'm speaking at [The Perl Conference](http://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc) in Salt Lake City this Tuesday.

My talk will tell the story of how I got involved with the relaunch of Perl.com, the current state of the site, and our plans for the future. I'll share my slides here after the conference, but I promise the jokes are funnier in-person.

I'm [scheduled](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc/session/relaunching-perl-com-the-first-6-months/) to speak at 3pm MDT, on Tuesday June 19th. Stevan Little, always popular, will be giving his [talk](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2018-slc/session/gazing-into-the-camels-navel-a-mop-without-the-class/) at the same time, so I might be presenting to a small crowd. Let's see!

The last Salt Lake City Perl Conference was a big success, and this one appears to be shaping up to be the same way. If you're heading to The Perl Conference, come and say hi ðŸ‘‹
